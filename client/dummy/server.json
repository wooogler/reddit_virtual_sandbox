The replay desyncs from the expected state approximately 6 minutes and 30 seconds into the match.\n\nFor those who don't want to click through, some of the statistics shown here are things like the amount of Hero Damage dealt by each player to each player on the enemy team, like in Game 2 on Infernal Shrines between Chilly Mountain and Simplicity, Lutano's Maiev dealt 8,203 damage to Player 3's Hero(that being Mysticleez's D.Va) over the course of the game. Another example of statistics is in Game 4 on Battlefield of Eternity between WildHeart Esports and Granit Gaming, Zergling(D.Va) used funz's(Medivh) Portals 3 times, Unaverted(Hanzo) used them 21 times, piTkiD(Diablo) used them 19 times, Buds(Deckard) used them 7 times, and funz himself used them 19 times.\n\nPresently, some of these statistic are a bit more difficult to read because they share their slot with other talents on the tier and the tooltips aren't dynamically updated, an example of this is [[Genji/16]], where I track Final Cut and Steady Blade, so the tooltip displays as \"Final Cut Damage, Steady Blade Bonus Damage to Heroes\", rather than displaying one or the other. Reflect isn't tracked because it's a bit more complicated to reliably track.\n\nI hope to make future posts like this quicker in the future, but while making this I encountered a few bugs with the system that had to be decided upon(looking at you, [[Sins Exposed]], you silly talent)",
