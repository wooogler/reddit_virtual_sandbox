The wealthier parts of Northern Virginia (where I grew up) tend to have more DUI checkpoints and stuff like that, but if you go 10-15 mph over the speed limit (on a highway following the flow of traffic) you will very rarely get a speeding ticket. On many occasions I've driven past a police officer who set up a speed trap w/ a radar gun going like 70 in a 55 mph zone (I-495 / I-395) and never got a ticket.\n\nIn Southern Virginia though, I got a speeding ticket for doing the same exact thing and if you talk to other Virginia residents they say the same thing. I think it's because the counties are much poorer so they rely more heavily on money from speeding tickets... but that stuff stays on your driving record statewide, affects your insurance rates etc.",

I can also find links showing the opposite.\n\nAnother relevant take here is that I feel there is name calling going on, hence why I said let the guy himself say what he is. \n\nI'd enough people ganged together to say I was purple, I would still have right and sense to say, nope I am not purple. While purple is more binary that white supremacist, the individuals' right to self declare is still preeminent.\n\nTo get to the heart of your comment, as I noted, white supremacy is an idea, one easily disputed if we look at the excellence all around us. So white supremacists are in fact only an issue when, like anyone else, they 1. seek to proselytize their beliefs in an open forum (I'm against proselytizing, not the ideas being proselytized) or 2. Express their ideas in the form of physical violence or visible overt harassment of their target.\n\nThe same rules apply to every idea set. That's what's nice, in my mind.

That means that if you got one strain of covid and were fine, you will have an extremely high chance of defeating the other strains. The different covid variants are still 99.999% percent the same. \nAna when a person gets covid, they get exposed to thousands of different surface proteins and they build full spectrum immunity to all the viral proteins (antigens). The vaccine only gives you one covid spike protein, which creates a rather small immune response compared to getting covid. Basically, if you already got covid, you have more immunity than a vaccine would give you.",
