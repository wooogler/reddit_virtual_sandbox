The CDC is an authoritative source.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic a lot of people were citing news stories out of Hong Kong about masks and distancing. That's great for an individual, but for policymakers there are sources that are considered more authoritative than others. And in general, the closer to home an authority is, the better it is to use to inform policy. Using research from Hong Kong, or Italy, or Spain isn't bad, but when the CDC or Surgeon General tell you to do something it carries more weight, and can be used to deflect more criticism. And conversely, when the cheeto in charge says something stupid, it can also be used to deflect criticism, which is why not electing morons is *also* really important.",

Donald Trump’s COVID response as a whole was extremely comprehensive. And the only major difference between Trump and Biden’s approach is the mask mandate. I watch many different news sources, so I know how CNN and NYT and many others conveniently leave out things they don’t want their readers to know.

There's no way around it. The only way this country could have locked down harder is if it was ordered across the entire country, and states had no power to intervene. Even that probably wouldn't have been very effective if the federal government didn't also order universal enforcement via martial law, knowing that they couldn't rely on red states, rural areas, and underserved areas in general to handle enforcement on their own. \n\nI'm sure that idea sounds great to these people, because it would get them exactly what they want, but remember that there may be someone with very, very different ideals in the White House in 2024.

They don't feel connected enough to their own learning to log on every day,\" he added.\n\nI don't doubt this at all.  Remote learning has been very difficult for us, and we have two educated, involved parents.  Just identifying assignments has been incredibly difficult.  In theory, the school system uses Schoology as a work management system, but many teachers give assignments in many other tools (Khan Academy, MathXL, etc. etc. etc.).  Last time I counted my kids had about 7 different places they had to go look for assignments.  Even with me riding herd on top of them, they still ended up with missing assignments.  Fortunately, most of the teachers have been forgiving and allowing kids to turn in late/missing work.\n\nThe problem is that Schoology has a \"newsfeed\" and teachers were/are just putting a link there to the 3rd party system.  But if you do this it doesn't register with Schoology as an assignment that is due - it's off the radar.  Some teachers have created somewhat of a workaround where they make a bogus Schoology assignment for some off-site assignment, and the child has to type \"done\" in the bogus assignment when they finished the off-site assignment.  But it's a poor solution.\n\nThen, too, it's hard for me to know for sure which classes have live instruction and which do not, short of taking my child's word for it.  The first semester the school was not taking attendance.\n\nAnyway long story but I think a year or two from now we are going to start hearing about data that shows that massive number of kids from poor and single-parent households just completely unplugged from school for about a year.",

COVID completely changed every single person's life for a year, which you can't really say for most of those events. It's caused major shifts on how people interact with the world, and how people view authority figures. Stuff like telecommuting, mask wearing when sick, and a greater dependence on stuff like delivery apps won't go away and really changed people's lives a lot. And, of course, 500,000 fewer people and millions with chronic health issues will severely impact us as well.\n\nThat's not to mention the political aspect. COVID has sunk the careers of several politicians, and I find it unlikely that biden would've been elected if it wasn't for COVID.

        "body": "> for everything else Texas messed up\n\nhey there, fellow Texan (going by the \"512\" in your user name)  O:-)\n\nYeah I'm not sure how I feel about this turn of events. On the one hand, \"thanks Gov. Greg\" for starting the vaccine rollout off right. And not for nothing, I personally got my 2nd shot last Wed, so in about 10 days I'll have immunity as good as anyone's, and better than like 80 or 90% of the population\n\nOn the other hand, I'm still mad at Abbott for what he did (and didn't do) last year. A half-assed lockdown, implemented late and lasting barely one month, followed by a mask ~~mandate~~ recommendation with no real teeth to it. I am very glad that the quasi-mandate was enough to prompt stores to implement their own \"no mask no service, same as no shoes / no shirt\" rules. \n\nAnd he did close all the schools and kept them closed the last two months of the 2019-20 school year... but then gave school districts far too little leeway last fall in terms of remote learning, which (indirectly) led to my cousin near Bastrop contracting COVID, along with her whole household, including her sister who wound up in the hospital for a day. And still feeling weak & tired a month or two later\n\nOn the third hand ... America as a whole severely messed up its pandemic response. When I look at the Worldometers charts' \"per capita\" charts, I note that Texas falls squarely in the middle of U.S. states. 24th-highest in cases per million residents (91,576, somewhat higher than the U.S. average of 88,349) and also 24th-highest in deaths per million (1,520, a bit lower than the U.S. average of 1,588).\n\nPart of the poor U.S. response I figure was inevitable -- when people say \"of course Australia and New Zealand got off light, they're super isolated and much easier to seal their borders\" I think they're not wrong. The U.S. simply has a huge emphasis on trade, travel and individual freedoms, so I figure there's no way we could avoided a minimum of 100,000 deaths. (The fact that we wound up with over 5x that many, and still rising, I lay right at the feet of Il Cheeto Benito.)\n\nSo, hooray Texas for getting vaccines right (or right enough). But boooo Texas for learning the hard way that \"oh shit, we better get vaccines right\" after 44,000 Texans paid the ultimate price. It may prove interesting to see what price, if any, Abbott pays in next year's election.",
