        "selftext": "So I'm gonna start off by saying this is a very touchy topic that I'm vehement about. It's unlikely I'll CMV of the entire Israeli/Palestinian conflict but I'm open to CMV on Birthright specifically. I'm open to believing that it's good, necessary, important and all that if I see some evidence.\n\n--------\n\nA Jerusalem Post reporter declared Israel to be the safest place in the world. She crunched the numbers. When comparing the crime statistics of terror-related crime in Israel with street crime in the major cities of London and New York City, she concluded that Israel is still probably the safest place in the world, particularly for Jews.\n\n------\n\nShes right too, especially with that modifier Jews. When compared to London, Israel as an entire country had less terror and street crime in a six month period than London had in a one month period by a large margin.\n\n--------\n\nBirthright Israel is a marketing campaign to entice Jews from around the world to emigrate to Israel. If Israel is constantly in an on-again-off-again war with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, the country will need more soldiers and more Zionist supporters. Enter Max Steinberg, who was conned by the glorified time-share presentation put on by the state of Israel. Except Birthright comes complete with free military training. So Steinberg, an American Jew, joined the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and went off to battle in Gaza where he was killed by a Hamas militant.\n\n----\n\nWriting for Slate, Allison Benedikt puts Steinbergs death in perspective and includes all of the ways the Birthright guides wish to mold the Jewish youth that attend:\n\n--------\n\n\"At some point during their all-expenses-paid, ten-day trip to a land where, as they are constantly reminded, every mountain and valley is inscribed with 5,000 years of their peoples history, [there is] the moment  the moment when participants realize just how important Israel is to them, to their fundamental identity, and how important they are to Israel. \n\n----------\n\nMaybe Max was especially lost, or especially susceptible, or maybe he was just looking to do some good and became convinced by his Birthright experience that putting on an IDF uniform and grabbing a gun was the way to do it. That serving and protecting the Jewish people was the moral thing to do, and that the best way to accomplish it was to go fight for the Jewish state. It turns out that its not that hard to persuade young people to see the world a certain way and that Birthright is very good at doing it. You spend hundreds of millions of dollars to convince young Jews that they are deeply connected to a country that desperately needs their support? This is what you get.\n\n------------\n\nIts heavily implied in this paragraph that Max died for nothing. With a focused eye, its clear that he had no right to be in Gaza in the first place alongside an army that blatantly violates international law. But its possible that Max didnt die for nothing. He may, in fact, have become an armor-piercing bullet point in a new edition of a Birthright pamphlet. His story teaches young Jews that their bond with a besieged, disputed plot of land is so strong that some are willing to pay the ultimate price.\n\nhttps://www.jpost.com/blogs/holier-than-thau/why-israel-is-still-the-safest-place-in-the-world-452375\n\nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/07/max-steinberg-death-how-birthright-convinces-american-jews-to-embrace-israel.html\n\n-----------\n\nA woman I dated was a political leftist Bernie supporter with no real opinion on the rights of Palestinians. After she returned she gave me an Israeli flag and put them up everywhere. There are videos on YT of her and the others doing \"search and rescue\" operations including knocking down walls with sledgehammers (dubious). There were strange serious prayer sessions around a fire. Then a massive rave in Tel Aviv where they all took ecstacy. Videos she showed me showed that the Isrseli public gets random air raid sirens for no reason to keep the populace scared. It was all pretty creepy.\n\n--------\n\nAnyway. It's a sore spot for me. When I've talked to other Jews that haven't done birthright they just say. \"C'mon it's just a party and some religion.\" I hope there's a reason they have a \"right to return.\" I would honestly like to hear the other perspectives for those who took the trip and of course anyone.",

        "selftext": "Before I begin, I want to state that I am not posting this with the intent of belittling the grievances that sparked the unrest related to Michael Brown and George Floyd, as well as the earlier Watts Riot, Rodney King Riot, etc. Police brutality is a legitimate problem.\n\nHowever, I am deeply uncomfortable with the growing trend in certain academic and media circles to characterize these events as \"uprisings\" or \"rebellions.\" The reasoning is that *riot* sounds too superficial. I can sympathize with that reasoning even if I personally do not agree, but I think calling those riots rebellions portrays them as an entirely different type of event.\n\nAt least for me, a rebellion implies an armed attempt to violently topple the existing government's power. It's participants will fight the authorities akin in the manner of a standing army or guerilla force. A riot lacks this insurrectionist nature. Perhaps the participants hope to indirectly topple the power system, but they may simply be lashing out in rage, and either way, they have no hope or intent of trying to defeat the authorities militarily. A riot can certainly become a rebellion, like with the Great Jewish Revolt against Rome. But there is still a qualitative difference between wrecking havoc until authorities disperse participants in unrest, and treating the authorities as an enemy army.\n\nThe distinction matters primarily because of how the government is expected to respond to the unrest. Sure, a ruthless leader may respond to the two the same way, but we would typically expect a principled government today to disperse a riot using non-lethal means - tear gas, shielded police, rubber bullets, the works. By contrast, an armed rebellion, at least in the eyes of most, gives the government license to fight back with lethal force. Riots are \"dispersed.\" Rebellions are \"crushed.\"\n\nAnd yet only the most hardline conservatives would've been comfortable with police in Ferguson gunning down demonstrators en masse, even as they ceased being completely peaceful.",

        "selftext": "Firearms can no longer be used to rebel against a tyrannical government, not due to a lack of citizen firepower, but because insurrections don't happen in countries where citizens are satisfied with their quality of life, even if the government is oppressive, because citizens plain and simply don't care unless something directly and negatively affects them, and even if people were unsatisfied with their quality of life, most people aren't willing to risk their lives rebelling against the government unless they've got nothing left to lose. Case in point: Hitler deregulated guns for everyone except the Jews and citizens of Germany did fuck all. You could say \"They could if everyone had the same mindset as me\" but communism could also work if everyone had the same mindset as you, as could just about every system that everyone agrees can't work. But let's say that people were willing to fight, insurrections at a level which could overthrow the government would still be impossible to organize if the government was trying to actively stop it from happening, which it probably would because the government spies on you.\n\nFurthermore, the government controls the flow of information. If the government wanted to become tyrannical, it would not need to take up arms and potentially damage itself and its populationall it would need to do is slowly spread propaganda in favor of tyranny and censor opposition or pay private corporations to do it, slowly chop away people's rights (and they would not oppose it; we know because it has happened countless times and continues to happen repeatedly), and you would eventually find yourself a population which believes that tyranny is normal and justified (\"in order to prevent crime\"); from that point onwards, anyone who speaks in opposition to the government would either be censored or be considered a terrorist by the population.\n\nOn a similar note, the government does not need arms to crush rebellions, it could simply cut off their basic supplies or tighten the regulations; look at what happened to the magatards who tried to storm the capitolthey could no longer leave Washington because they would be caught and punished, and note that this was only for taking illegally selfies inside the white house under a non-tyrannical government; imagine if they got the death penalty, do you think people would attempt to do that again? People assume that a tyrannical government right now would have the same amount of control over its populace as a tyrannical government did in 18th century, which simply isn't truea government right now can do everything that a government 300 years ago would have struggled to do and more without firing a single shot.\n\nThe real reason gun ownership should be supported is that (1) gun violence is a non-issue, (2) it is a victimless crime, and (3) self-defense; of course, self-defense could mean defense from authority which could be defined as defense from tyranny, but it could not mean causing insurrections which is what most people mean when they say overthrowing tyranny.\n\nI'm kind of retarded, so I'm definitely leaving something apart, but the core of what I'm trying to say is that tyranny no longer happens through arms, and that even if it did, the ordinary citizens wouldn't care if it didn't affect them.",

An example would probably be the best way to explain what I mean.\n\nTake pronoun usage. Focussing on individual rights creates a conflict between freedom of speech (using the pronouns you want) and freedom of expression (choosing how to identify). There is no self-consistent position to take, since siding one way or another will compromise a person's liberty. This is made worse, should, via case law or otherwise, another circumstance result in the opposite conclusion. You end up with inconsistent laws, and constant arguments over which groups rights are being infringed/elevated. What's worse is that a decision focussed on individual rights may actually be harmful to the society as a whole \\*cough\\* gun ownership \\*cough\\*.\n\nHowever, a focus on societal benefit removes any possible contradiction. While there may be different opinions on what classifies as \"the good of society\", any decision can be self-consistent. If you decide that society is better off when people are treated with respect, including how they view themselves, you can implement those laws without being self-contradictory, since restriction on individual liberty isn't the point. It is about making society better, which is a positive-sum game. This re-framing of the discussion creates a meaningful society rather than an emergent pseudo-organised group of individuals.\n\nMy (until now) implicit claim is that most WEIRD societies default to the mentality of the individual, and this is a bad thing. I guess that's kinda the TL;DR\n\nTo pre-empt a couple likely counterpoints. No, I'm not saying individual liberty doesn't matter at all, and no, I am not saying the polis is above all else; this is about framing. In order for a society to function effectively, that needs to be the lens through which conflicts are assessed.",

        "title": "CMV: Trans Rights activists are reprehensible human beings.",
        "selftext": "Boy o Boy do I have so much to say about this topic. to start my position, i firmly believe that trans rights activists want nothing but to destroy every form of common sense out there and ultimately want a collapse of society and it's structure. you might thing I am crazy to suggest that there's some big bad wolf trans rights group that's out to get there but I don't. i believe that even as individuals they're nothing but extremely toxic and are using courtesy as a weapon. here are the reasons why i say so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Trans Women/Men are Women/Men - honestly, I don't really know  what does that even mean anymore. so the basic position was that Gender is a sociological construct and hence there can be more than one definition of woman and fair enough, that's understandable. the problem arises when you mix and match those definitions according to your agenda. here's an  example, if a male suggest that he only likes to date a woman and when they say \"woman\", they're using the dictionary definition i.e. an adult female human being. by using that definition of woman, they're clearly stating what they mean by a woman in a relationship context. these trans rights activists then jump the gun and say....oh wait, so you mean trans woman are not real woman. i  mean what the hell does areal woman means? if someone is clearly suggesting that they mean a particular definition of woman, they're essentially telling they want a biological female and a trans woman isn't a biological female. also i don't know why this needs to be said but \"NO ONE OWE YOU AN EXPLANATION ON WHY THEY CHOOSE TO DATE WHO THEY DATE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE\". \n2. Social Coercion/Shaming - This is probably my biggest gripe with this bunch. they're trying to control people's speech by using methods of shaming. here's how it goes, you create a stigma around a word and then throw around that word willy nilly. they've successfully weaponized the word transphobia by creating a lot of stigma around that word and shown that social repercussions of that in form of shaming and people loosing their jobs, so both a social and economic impact. when you create that much weight behind a word and then you use that word willy nilly and then say \"we're only trying to create a more tolerant and inclusive society\", it's really difficult to buy that bullshit.\n3. Double Standards - Honestly, it's probably the bread and butter of these lot...both as a group and as individuals. i guess you might be aware of the recent superstraight debacle but if you're not, recently a bunch of folks decided to create a term that clearly defined their dating preference  by creating a sexuality called Superstraight which meant preference for  only opposite sex( not gender only sex). a lot of the folks talked about how some trans right's activists tried to shame them into dating by using their label  of transphobia. what did they do? yeah, got the community banned. I mean this is a lot that wants everyone to believe that there are real genders and sexualities like Aliagender, autosexual, masculine of center, allogender, pansexual, Demisexual et al and all of these are legit and valid but you can't have a proper term to define preference for biological sex because that's hate crime.\n4. Perpetual Victimhood - this is blatantly obvious. oh, we have no power and we're all so oppressed.  well yes, i can see that how oppressed you are when you can get a sub cancelled in one week, can force tik tok and twitter into believing your definition of hate crime and can effectively shut down mildest of voice criticizing your behavior. sure, i believe in your victimhood with that evidence. they then point out how being trans in banned in X number of countries as a deflection. i  mean sure, but what does Saudi Arabia or UAE's laws got to do with you who's sitting in a modern western democracy. all i see that as a deflection and way to claim someone else's victimhood to feel victimized yourself. it's like saying \"oh, there are people getting slaughtered in Afghanistan and i feel so victimized because of that here in India.      \n\nfor closing remarks, i want to say that this is not some minority or fringe of trans rights activists. if someone still wants to claims that \"oh, it's a tiny vocal minority\",  then let me say this, your tiny minority is creating a major damage. your tiny minority is pushing envelope to a point where it's threatening to tear the envelope. Respect is a two  way street, you can't expect people to keep on giving respect while you throw your labels around like candy on Halloween.",

        "selftext": "I live in the UK where guns are already banned, so automatically my default view is that they are bad so they should be banned everywhere, and I've never really met anyone who would challenge that, which makes me worried that I'm simply ignorant about my ignorance.\n\nSo I'm putting my main argument here to see how somebody who isn't me would argue against such a statement.\n\nMy belief is that guns should be banned because I believe no civilian should be given weapons specifically designed to cause serious harm like guns are. It's fine if somebody wants to beat up a home intruder with a baseball bat because it's unlikely that that was ever their intention and the designers of the bat did not make it hoping for somebody to use it that way. But if you use a gun to do anything other than kill or badly injure someone then you are misusing it, anything built with such mal intent shouldn't be allowed to civilians in general.\n\nAs well this, there are other ways to defend oneself with tools that are not built specifically to cause harm, such as pepper spray, tasers (which physically lack the power to cause physical harm), and martial arts. With these I fail to see why anyone feels the need to be able to take a life at any second in order to feel safe.\n\nAnd finally, the most compelling argument I've seen for guns in one of the few times my view has been challenged, is that there simply is no way to rid of all the guns in America. I've thought about this quite a bit and my main issue is that no change happens instantly, but changes to happen. If guns become illegal then everyone who respects the law should give them in quickly. Every person who legally owns a gun should be on record so searching their homes should they not comply shouldn't be a problem. And then only illegally owned guns should be left, but after a few years the police force should be able to decrease their numbers significantly.\n\nWith all of these combined, I simply do not see a reason why America cannot simply ban guns in this moment and I want to see if there are any flaws with that ideology.

Examples of ACLU and Brennan Center articles are below.\n\n[https://www.aclu.org/other/oppose-voter-id-legislation-fact-sheet](https://www.aclu.org/other/oppose-voter-id-legislation-fact-sheet) \n\n[https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/new-voter-suppression](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/new-voter-suppression)\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that if you require an ID to exercise your right to vote, you are racist.\n\nRight now in the U.S. House of Representatives, there are two bills being discussed (HR 8, and HR 1446). These are both based around expanded background checks for the purchasing of firearms. In order to complete a Federal background check, you MUST HAVE A GOVERNMENT-ISSUED PHOTO ID. The link to the ATF form is below (specifically points 26a and 26b).\n\n[https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/4473-part-1-firearms-transaction-record-over-counter-atf-form-53009/download](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/4473-part-1-firearms-transaction-record-over-counter-atf-form-53009/download)\n\nPeople purchase firearms for any number of uses, such as food acquisition, entertainment, or protection; all of which are protected by the Constitution. \n\nAn apples to apples comparison... the Democrats have clearly explained that requiring an ID to practice a right spelled out in the constitution is racist in this country. They are also adamant that you must have a photo ID in order to purchase a tool to protect yourself. \n\nTherefore, the bills they are currently pushing are blatantly racist, with the end result of disenfranchised minorities being disproportionately able to defend themselves.\n\nNote: It is illegal to commit a crime, regardless of the weapon used (car, fist, knife, gun, bomb, etc.).\n\nNote: Criminals will not follow the law to begin with (hence why they are referenced with criminally breaking a law).\n\nChange my view.",

        "selftext": "To start off, when thinking about minimum wage in a logical economic setting and assuming there is a genuine interest in keeping to the spirit of the idea of a minimum wage, any advanced nation should have minimum wage increasing with inflation, something that can be negotiated every year to set the exact amount. \n\nNext, elections should have run-offs. Its a decisively superior system that allows for more parties and opinions in the public sphere without any fear of one candidate splitting the vote of a decent more popular candidate. Someone like Bernie Sanders could run on his own ideals and it would have no effect on the chances of democrats winning a national election, for example.\n\nObviously, we can also look at the social programs where we find the US, despite being one of the richest countries on earth, to be one of the worst examples of anywhere. Education and medicine has an impossibly high costs when -most- countries are able to provide some for free or cheap to some degree of completeness, first world countries of course providing more.\n\nNotably, having a huge military is really just robbing the citizens of the United States for the benefit of contractors, weapons manufacturers, and to reduce the tax expenditure on self defense that other nations would have to spend otherwise (while losing their own independence for having to rely on the US for protection).\n\nWith recent notoriety, the police are given way to much legal leeway and firepower. In some first world nations the police aren't even allowed to have guns, or to surprise people without legal cause and it works just fine.\n\nAnd lastly and most importantly, what makes it regressive and truly awful, is how much of a drain of resources and energy they are to the world. The US is literally the driving force in destroying this planet and society from all notable aspects. A country like Norway, with a similar amount of GPD per capita as the US, and much less money overall, can achieve something like producing 100% of their own energy from thermal and hydro. American households also use about three times as much energy per household as a German household, while having some of the dirtiest energy production of any first world country. \n\nI'm open to reading arguments on any one of those points if you want to attempt to justify why any of those would be acceptable or understandable in any way, and why America and Americans don't deserve harsh judgement from the rest of the world. To give an example, at one point in time there was a protest of about a hundred workers in a country, and they were all swiftly gunned down to appease the US, a common generic example.",

        "selftext": "By \"average person\" I mean a person without any special training who's also relatively physically weak. Around 50% of humans are women, so it impacts the average physical strength even more. Keep that fact in mind. \n\nNow, to my point. In most jurisdictions that I know of, you're allowed to use any means necessary, including lethal force, in order to stop a life-threatening attack. Let's imagine all of the following situations to happen inside your house to give you even more legal protection. Let's also imagine that you're put in a situation in which you're forced to confront the attackers, it's quite obvious that if you can just leave you should leave, we aren't considering this possibility under this thought experiment. \n\n1. The attacker is armed with a firearm. That's it, you can't do anything to them if you don't have a gun yourself. They have to hit you once or twice in order to neutralize you, you will lose in the vast majority of situations. \n2. The attacker is armed with a knife. You have some chance to deal with the threat, however, you will get stabbed in the process and you will experience blood loss that can either kill you or cause permanent damage to your internal organs. \n3. There's several attackers armed with knives. Again, just like in the first situation, you can't do anything. \n4. There's several unarmed attackers. You still can't do anything, even trained specialists won't be able to deal with several determined opponents at the same time. \n\nNow, to the tools that are available to you besides guns. None of them will be even remotely effective against other guns, so we're not even talking about that. \n\n1. Blunt objects such as hammers, baseball bats, metal pipes, etc. It's difficult to do enough damage to your opponent with those weapons. On top of that, most criminals have a decent amount of fighting experience and probably know how to deal with a blunt weapon. \n2. Knives. Good weapons for attack, pretty much useless for self-defense. Stab wounds have very little stopping power, people rarely feel them due to adrenaline rush, it takes a lot of skill and strength to wield a knife in an effective manner, and even then it takes too much time before the blood loss causes the attacker to lose consciousness. \n3. Tasers. Even police tasers fail very often, civilian tasers are usually limited in power to the point that they can't inflict dangerous damage at all. I remember how we were tasing each other for fun back in school. It was the most powerful taser you can buy as a civilian in Russia (where I live). \n4. Pepper sprays. Actually a very useful tool for non-life threatening confrontations, completely non-lethal, yet very effective, requires very little training, everyone should carry one. There's no reason those should be illegal or require a license. Against several determined opponents though? It won't be sufficient reliably. But it is ideal against animals. \n5. Airsoft/paintball/air guns, blank-firing firearms, crossbows. No. Just no. \n\nThe best self-defense tool is your brain, of course, but we all make mistakes and a gun can help you fix a lot of those mistakes. In the situations I've listed, I don't see any reliable way for you to defend yourself without a gun. \n\nAlso, inb4 \"guns bad, guns = violent crime\". That's not related to the point about guns being the most effective tool of self-defense, I'm not arguing whether or not they should be legal. They are legal where I live and it's not going to change any time soon.",

        "title": "CMV: The solution to gun violence is almost entirely economic, not gun control.",
        "selftext": "First, I know that there are a lot of gun control posts here. I have read through many of them today and I still do not feel swayed. \n\nThis post is specifically about the US but I am also interested in perspectives from other countries. In the US there are three classes of gun owners/users. I understand there are always overlaps between these classes but for the most part, each of these classes has different relationships with guns than the others do.\n\n1. Hobbyists - Think hunters, people who own guns because they like guns, people who lead relatively safe lives but own guns for protection.\n\n2. Gun Money - Think police officers, security, gang members, people who make money illegally, regular people who need guns for protection from any of the other people in this category.\n\n3. Mentally Ill - Think mass shooters, people who procure guns to harm someone for reasons other than money, suicides\n\nI will address these classes one-by-one. We will start with the premise that fewer gun deaths is better than more gun deaths. For the purpose of this post, I will consider gun control to be the strictest possible form, like nearly impossible to get a gun legally as a regular person. I understand that creating laws and enforcement systems to maintain completely strict gun control is probably impossible but this is a thought experiment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hobbyists**\n\nOf the three classes, these people are responsible for the fewest gun deaths.\n\n*Gun control accomplishes*: Most of these people will no longer own guns. Some who would have owned a gun to feel safe will no longer feel safe (due to some 2s and 3s procuring illegal guns\\*). There will be almost no accidental shootings, especially with children. Peoples hobbies of gun collecting or hunting will no longer exist. \n\n*Best solution to gun deaths*: Probably gun control but it is fairly negligible once you factor in that people may no longer feel safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* See note at end of post\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gun Money**\n\nThis is the class with by far the most gun murders.\n\n*Gun control accomplishes*: Police officers will likely still be assigned firearms. Independent security guards will likely no longer be carrying guns. Security forces are now at a significant disadvantage to those who procure guns illegally. \n\nFor people who make money illegally, violence remains a good tool for them since they cant use the judicial system to settle disputes. Also, since regular folks and security forces are carrying fewer guns, they will gain an advantage if they do own guns. At the same time, the punishment for gun ownership will be very severe so they will have to weigh the pros and cons. \n\nSimilarly, for gang members whose best economic prospects are related to gang activities, they will suffer significant economic consequences if they give up guns but another gang procures illegal guns. By definition, they do not have a superior economic solution than gang activity available to them. So they still have a strong incentive to procure illegal guns. This is a Nash equilibrium problem that ends up in everyone owning guns.\n\nFor regular people who own guns for protection against other Gun Money people, they are now at a severe disadvantage and will feel very unsafe.\n\n*Best solution*: Economic reform. Gun control just creates a new power vacuum that will inevitably end up in violence. If we can provide new economic opportunities that are superior to those that currently exist in this class, then violence will go down because there are fewer people who need guns to make money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mentally Ill**\n\nThis class has few gun murders compared to gun money but the deaths are always very visceral and high profile like a school shooting. This class has the most gun deaths (mostly suicide).\n\n*Gun control accomplishes*: Some will procure guns illegally, some will not. Some shootings will be avoided, some will not. It is hard to tell. I have heard a lot of stories about how most mass shooters procured their guns legally. That makes sense because it is currently easier to procure a gun legally than illegally. Gun ownership and suicides are correlated with each other. Reduced guns is related to fewer suicides.\n\n*Best solution*: For me this is a tossup between mental health reform and gun control in terms of limiting the deaths. But if you take away a mentally ill persons gun, they are still mentally ill and that is no good for them or society.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summary**\n\nAgain, fewer gun deaths is better than more gun deaths. In total, strict gun control has a negligible affect on the first group. It has a negligible to highly negative affect on the second group. It has a positive to negligible affect on the third group. I think you can also achieve the positive to negligible affect on the third group through mental health reform. This leaves the second group. If the main cause of gun deaths in this group is the economic motivation, then solving the economic problem will help with the gun problem.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* History has shown that when a desirable item is banned, a black market for that item will form. How large, successful, or robust of a black market depends on a lot of factors. But it is a guarantee that a black market of some sort will grow. Larger black market = more deaths. See War on Drugs. \\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some counter arguments I have heard**:\n\n1. Procuring an illegal gun is way way way more difficult than procuring an illegal drug. So it is not a given that someone who wants an illegal gun can get one. I agree with this to some extent. A regular person like me would likely find it impossible to procure an illegal gun but someone who make a living outside of the law (class 2) will have connections and a much stronger incentive to get a gun. This incentive (economic demand) will stimulate the black market.\n\n2. Other countries have instituted gun control and have had great results. The US is a unique country with our vast income inequality, history of oppression and political polarization. It is not realistic to compare country to country directly without looking at all of these underlying factors.\n\n**Some arguments against gun control that I think are stupid**:\n\n1. We need guns to defend ourselves against tyranny. Armed people stormed the Capitol, they scared a lot of people, they embarrassed the country, but they never had a shot of overthrowing the government. Also this was a weird case where the armed people were storming the Capitol **in favor of** tyranny. Also, if they really wanted to, the government with its $700 BILLION defense budget can put you or your movement down.\n\n2. But the Second Amendment wah wah wah The writers of the constitution understood that times change and a political system needs to be able to change. THATS WHY THEY MADE A BRAND NEW FUCKING GOVERNMENT INSTEAD OF ANOTHER MONARCHY. So they surely understood that some things that were written back then would be out of date in the future. Thats why the majority of the constitution is so vague. They never intended their words to be set in stone and if political will motivates a change, Im sure they would approve of that idea. See all sorts of stupid out of date shit like the electoral college (useful at the time it was created but no longer).",

After the NSDAP achieved power, Ernst Röhm, the head of the SA, tried to enact a workers revolution, and Hitler responded by killing him. He also killed him because he was a gay.\n\nThe economy of Hitlers Germany was a mixed economy, like all economies, but they had a much smaller welfare state than modern America. Remember that this was the same time period that FDR did the new deal. Across the developed world, people were upset about abuses that had taken place during the industrial revolution, so it was natural and good to enact reforms.\n\nBoomers will also claim that Hitler took peoples guns. In actual fact, Germany never had a Second Amendment, so people in Germany did not have gun rights when Hitler was appointed Chancellor. He actually did a lot to expand gun rights for the people. The only people whose guns he took were Jews. Excluding the ban on Jews, no single new gun restriction was added under Hitler, and many were loosened.\n\nNazi Germany was a freedom country, and one that protected the people and culture from its enemies.\n\nIf any single boomer conservative says that Hitler was left-wing, I would ask them, if Hitler had won the war, would we have:\n\nChild transgenders, Mass drug addiction, Mass abortion, The destruction of morality, Mass immigration, Islamic terrorism, Widespread divorce and the death of the family, Convicted p*dophiles reading to children at the public library, Rampant pornography, Feminism, Black people running amok and killing everyone.\nThe obvious answer  which no conservative can deny  is that we would have not one of those things.",

        "selftext": "Following Britain's Sarah Everard case (girl abducted and killed by police officer) there has been a series  of outcries by the women on social media and the larger media painting the picture that somehow women are particularly under a constant fear, persecution and danger of attack that men in the society justsee or feel. There's even a politician that  dared to make the argument that maybe men should have a 6pm curfew to protect women.\n\nNow I am not saying women shouldn't feel safe. The world is dangerous and however you cut it women are physically smaller beings and their size makes them easier targets generally speaking, so they should be more diligent about exposing themselves to dangerous situations.\n\nBut even as a 6'0 martial artist man I have never felt \"safe\" walking at night either. Especially in any secluded areas or streets. I constantly have my head on a swivel, and if I am walking through any woodland area I will literally break a branch off a tree as a \"walking stick\" just in case.  Young black boys in the UK carry knives to feel safe, American men carry guns.  I think it's inaccurate to assume men are not fearful about being victimised at night.  \nI think it's inaccurate to think women are unique in their fear or that men are any safer on the street at night than women.\n\nIn conclusion:  I don't think the fact that women FEEL more unsafe than men walking at night is relevant when the actual victims of violence are overwhelmingly men. \nFor the girl Sarah Everard, I think walking 50 mins in the dark at night was not a smart move, she took an uneccesary risk, and unfortunately for her she paid with her life.",

Also, mass shootings tend to be in places where distances are greater than in a home, which decreases the likelihood that shots will hit their targets. More than likely, these civilians will be armed with pistols which take great skill to shoot accurately at longer distances.\n\nAdrenaline, fast heart rate and fear pumping through the veins of a person can reduce the accuracy of any shooter, regardless of skill level and training of an individual.

We're all guilty of doing it, including me. \n\nI'll use myself as example, I'm a white male republican living in a rural county in the USA.

I'm not racist, I'm married to a black woman with two kids and want the best life for them. I'm not a homophobe, my best friend is gay and I want the same wellbeing for him. I do own a gun, I've fired it once in five years and keep it in the chance I need it. Sometimes it blows people's mind that you don't fit into the bubble they've formed.

        "selftext": "The Democratic Party represents, in American mainstream popular culture the \"good guys\" of American politics. To a great deal of Americans, they are viewed as the caring and sweet souls who are always there to give speeches about how great things can be if Americans unite, who have their pronouns in their Twitter bio and an LGBT flag emoji for good measure, who support all the cuddly progressive goodies liberals want in American politics, but rarely get. They are a hot bubbling jacuzzi where you're queen being served a scrummy rocky road sundae (don't skimp on the fudge!), a cuddly Pikachu plushie to snuggle up with in bed while binging Disney Plus and sipping a pumpkin spice latte on a rainy Autumn evening. They are heckin' doggos in the white house and Barack Obama's kind smile. Everything is OK. Biden's in office now. Sleep tight, sweetie. Brunch is in the morning.\n\nExcept they aren't. *That's the image they project*, and its worked. They are, of course, a significantly right-wing, corporate, imperialist political party who only make people THINK they are the party of happy smiles, and that, in my opinion, is why they are dangerous as Republicans - just more subtly. They are controlled opposition, shrouded in a cloak of sunshine and rainbows, their underdog nature amplified by liberal political culture and the media to make it look like their failings aren't intentional.\n\nIf you look at the Republicans, you'll notice that also project an image to keep their voters on their side no matter what. Normal people see the Republicans as the ruthlessly evil, extremist Christian fascists that they are, but to their voters, they are the champions of American conservatism, the mighty defenders of the military, of guns, of the founding fathers, of the constitution, the party of Lincoln and Reagan, the party standing up for the greatest nation on God's green Earth that the entire filthy commie world *needs to bow down to and respect*. MAGA!\n\nIf both of the above stereotypes of those parties sound utterly crazy and cartoonish, thats because they are designed to be. That's all mainstream American politics is: theatre. A pantomime, a circus, a game show. BOTH parties support protecting the big banks, never passing free healthcare or raising the minimum wage, doing almost nothing about systemic racism, locking up immigrant kids, and bombing other nations. They just cloak their real intentions behind these stereotypical characters they play to make Americans *think* they have a choice. There is no choice. Regardless of whether you're a Democratic or a Republican you are a pawn in their plan. Oodles of Democratic and Republican politicians are friends and agree with each other and liberal voters are now happy to rehabilitate Dubya because he's now a goofy cowboy grandpa when his policies lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. Obama devastated Libya, but it's OK because at least he was civil about it. Both are profiting off of *immense* American stupidity and gullibility regardless of whether you're threatening to murder the libs with your God-given assault rifle or giggling with glee at Stephen Colbert throwing a cheap shot at Donnie Dirtbag. Theyre BOTH two different flavours of the same right-wing American imperialism designed to perpetuate the two-party system until the country finally falls.\n\nCMV.",

It's not and I could go into why but I think it's pretty obvious why. If you're to the point where you're 'in a bind' when it comes down to sex, youre probably not responsible enough to pull out or you just don't care. I think a big part of why it's becoming the norm and popular is because schools are giving the seal of approval.

        "selftext": "A few weeks ago, I read an article that certain Chicago politicians are blaming the spike in Carjackings in the city on GTAV and violent video games.  Some politicians have even introduced a bill which would ban the sale of GTAV in Illinois.  \n\n[https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2021/2/22/22295471/grand-theft-auto-illinois-ban-violent-video-games-carjackings-evans-operation-safe-pump](https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2021/2/22/22295471/grand-theft-auto-illinois-ban-violent-video-games-carjackings-evans-operation-safe-pump)\n\nChicago has seen an explosion of carjackings this year, with over 350 and counting as of March 16, 2021.  Often vehicles are carjacked to be used in other crimes to make it harder to trace criminals.  \n\nI find it completely absurd some would think that an 8 year old video game that was released in 2013 is responsible for the sudden uptick in carjackings over the course of 2020 and 2021.  While some studies have noticed some level of increased aggression, There are 0 conclusive studies which show violent video games lead to violence in the real world.  \n\nVideo games are a form of pop culture media, along with comic books, movies and rock and roll.  In the 1950s, violent comic books were blamed for violence in the real world, then it was rock music, violent movies, now video games.  Interestingly enough, violent crime rates, particularly among young people has steadily decreased while video games have quickly evolved and graphics have become practically realistic.  Video games have gone from 2 bars hitting a ball to each other (pong) to expansive open world games like Skyrim, Fallout 4 and GTA V.  A Pew research study found that over 90% of teenage boys play video games.  If video games made people violent, wouldn't the crime figure be totally inverted?   Anytime a new form of media comes along, those who do not understand it blame it for society's problems, and that partially has to do with being illiterate in the subject.  Fearing what you cannot understand is a common human trait.  \n\nAll these media which I mentioned are fantasy.  GTA V is a fantasy game, in the real world, I won't get bombed by a jet and blown up by a tank every time I step out of my house.  Playing call of duty does not train me on how to shoot a gun.  Does a controller simulate the weight of a firearm? Or teach me how to accurately reload a gun? Does the fact i'm an ace pilot in GTA, and often win battles with other players mean i'm ready to pilot an F-22 jet for the air force? Of course not, it's fantasy.  On the flip side, does the fact I can steal cars in GTA and run people over, or do mass shootings mean I will in real life? Of course not.   \n Consequences in video games are simply limited to video games, real life isn't like that.  Even the best simulator games cannot replace the real world.  1,000 hours flying 747s in Microsoft Flight Simulator doesn't mean I can go walk into JFK airport and fly the next New York to London flight for United airlines.  \n\nTying into this point, one of the reasons video games are so popular is because they allow players to perform skills or activities which they can't in the real world, which is one of the reasons Grand Theft Auto V is so popular.  A perfect way to illustrate this point is back in 2007, Conan O'Brien challenged Serena Williams (one of the world's best tennis players) to a game of Wii tennis, and ended up beating her.  Had that been on the real court, he would have gotten destroyed. \n\nIf anything, video games may prevent carjackings and violence.  If you're inside your house playing GTA, you're not out stealing cars or shooting neighborhoods up.  Video games are just a scapegoat for politicians who don't want to do the hard work of finding ways to combat violent crime.",

        "selftext": "Maybe because I watched so many cop shows in my life I look at things from their pov a bit but here is my opinion. Cops are there to uphold the law, not to bring forth social change. By that I mean, maybe good social policies can reduce the crime rates in certain neighbourhoods or educate people who join the gangs, but none of that falls onto cops. They deal with the here and now, if someone is committing a crime they have to arrest him. If statistically a demographic is more likely to commit a crime in a certain area, they should be alert. \n\nCops also arent the legislative branch, they don't decide how long someone goes to jail for or what is criminal in the first place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally I think people underestimate that it's a scary job where you or your colleagues could get shot and killed, and so I understand why they have to prioritize each other's safety. I see people often say something like there being a better way to do this or that, but hindsight is always 20/20. I have very little sympathy for people who violently or stupidly resist arrest and get killed. If someone reaches for something and it's a phone, they're still a moron. \n\nI'm from an European country and i know many Americans say how Europe has less crime and in some places cops don't even carry guns, but that's correlation and not causation. Keep in mind that many European countries are very homogenous, some are very small, so there is a lot of common culture. Guns are usually forbidden so the chance of a petty thief carrying a gun is low. Cops simply don't face the same situations for the most part \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think what happened to George Floyd was fucked up, but many cases after that I am much less sympathetic about. or at least I feel like the cops aren't to blame. I think it's very fair to want many legislative and policy changes, starting with reduced sentences and focus on rehabilitation and free education so that people have a chance at life no matter how poor they start, and making it harder to get weapons. Then maybe cops will be dealing with different situations too. As is, I definitely feel cops are being scapegoats.",

First let me begin by saying that obviously, what happened is a tragedy, there is no justification or reason for it. It's awful and heart breaking. But you know what else has no justification? That fact that once again, the SJW community is blaming white people for everything.\n\nWhy can't we just leave it at \"AsianLivesMatter\"? Have your protests, have your awareness spread, there's nothing wrong with that. But don't start blaming white people for everything again. What does him being white have to do with anything? He was a lunatic, that's all. Lunatics come in all flavors. And he does not represent all whites, does he? And if he does to you, you're just as racist as he was.\n\nThis has nothing to do with white supremacy, that is a notion YOU invent yourselves because that's what you want to believe. If it had been a Black guy who did that, or Hispanic, or even another Asian, this wouldn't even be a story. But thank god he was white, because now you have something to speak out against for the next few weeks before you forget about it and move onto the next issue.\n\nNever mind the fact that Black people hate on Asians all the time. That's a fact, you can look it up. Black on Asian violence is rampant. But you won't ever see 'End Black Hate' signs. We can't do that. This is all SJW grandstanding BS. The simple fact of the matter is that HUNDREDS of people die every single week from gun violence--all races. They are all humans. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that all of you are being controlled. You love to speak out against white supremacy all the time, but fail to realize the real reason the elite stay in power is because they keep all of you fighting with each other all the time. Don't you understand that having all of these movements like BLM, and now ALM, is all to keep you distracted, creating more division, and less understanding.\n\nYou know what we really need to do right now? We need to end the separation in our communities. Instead of hearing about \"6 Asians\" or \"6 Black people..\" How about 6 HUMANS died. Humans--of all shapes, sizes, colors and religious backgrounds are killed every single week, and that's what needs to end. I mean, what happened to BLM now? Is it over? Cops have stopped killing Black people. Whites have stopped hating? Of course they haven't. You just switched to the next movement. Why? Because everything we do is transient. In another year, no one will remember BLM. And in another year after that, no one will remember ALM. So maybe we should just focus on the bigger picture, not endless SJW race campaigns. \n\nStop specifying the human race. Your identity politics are creating more division, and more hate.",
