I'm seeing so many people try to ruin careers, ruin livelihoods, and reputations because they think differently and that is a SCARY premise.  \n\n\nThe whole point of living in a free country (from US) is to be able to think and do what I like to do within boundaries of the law. We shouldn't be forced in one direction or the other. We also shouldn't restrict what you should be able to speak, read, or express by implementing laws or standards we must uphold.   \n\n\nI just saw that Gina Carano is out of a job because an angry group of hurt feelings didn't like her viewpoint on politics...are you kidding me? Have we as a society and people gotten so got damn sensitive to other people having thoughts and viewpoints outside of their own that companies are now going along with firing people that don't agree with the hurt feelings mob?

I am not denying this. But what grinds my gears is that my fellow  Americans are the loudest voices and have literally no sense of shame or self-awareness.\n\nWe're ostensibly supposed to hate China for *what they might do*...when what we **have already done** and continue to do is demonstrably worse. China interns Muslims? Cool. We carpet bomb them.\n\nAmericans are so comically fragile and defensive, which is normal for any \"great\"  country. What's completely unprecedented, however, is how comically fragile and defensive Americans are while having the loudest voices about how \"good\" they are. Even Russians at the peak of the Soviet Union didn't think that themselves and their empire were \"forces for good\".\n\nWe keep  spreading this meme that the American Empire has been \"surprisingly  tame\" and is probably the most benevolent empire in modern history...but  this is a complete joke. The U.S. government has literally overthrown  more than 40 democratically elected governments on literally every  continent including Australia. **We spend more on our military than the next largest 25 Armies combined.** In the Cold War, we overthrew more democratically elected governments per year than the fucking Nazis did at their peak.\n\nSure,  the Nazis and Communists killed millions...but so has the U.S. We  backed right wing death squads in Latin America and the Middle East that  have to date collectively murdered millions. We have also started  numerous wars that have resulted in the deaths of millions and creation  of literally dozens of millions of refugees.\n\nDoes  anyone remember the last time China gave chemical weapons of mass  destruction to a Middle Eastern country and then invaded them for  allegedly having a different set of chemical weapons (that they didn't  actually have at any point) because terrorists from ANOTHER Middle  Eastern country flew planes into Chinese buildings...because China was  simultaneously carpet bombing literally over half a dozen Muslim  countries simultaneously? Oh wait, China has never done anything close  to that.\n\nSo why are Americans the  loudest voices on Uighurs? What are you getting at? That the Chinese are  evil because they are interning Muslims instead of carpet bombing  them!?\n\nWhen was the last time  China wrecked an entire country and overthrew a democratically elected  governments so that they could use cheap slave labor to sell bananas? Oh  wait.\n\nWhen was the last time China dropped a nuclear weapon on an active civilian population? Oh wait.\n\nWhen was the last time China installed a puppet government in a Middle Eastern country to extract cheap oil? Oh wait.\n\nWhen  was the last time China installed a puppet government in a Middle  Eastern country to extract cheap oil and then declared said Middle  Eastern country a terrorist domicile subject to war because they  understandably got pissed off and reacted by replacing the Chinese  puppet government with an ultra-conservative and radical one that  promised to never again let the Chinese meddle in their internal  affairs? Oh wait.\n\nPollution? We still have China beat by that. **Yes, China currently emits more greenhouse gases than us**,  but it's because they're producing OUR CHEAP SHIT. We're China's  largest trading partner and it's not even close, over a third of  Chinese-produced goods eventually find their way to American consumers.  If China was wiped off the map today, greenhouse gas emissions would  rise immediately again tomorrow as supply chains and factories begin to  prop up again domestically. Additionally, **almost half of all global plastic waste was discarded by Americans as we entered the 21st century.** Unfortunately for the planet, the other countries are catching up.\n\n**This entirely consumerist and modern way of life observed around the world is a uniquely American invention.**  Additionally, this entirely consumerist and modern way of life is  literally killing this planet and threatens all organized life on Earth.\n\nLet's  not even get into how rich Americans have spent the past decades  literally hiring mercenaries and assassins to overthrow governments and  kill activists that fight for the environment.\n\nThe  environment isn't even the only shit that rich, religious Americans are  fucking up. They prolonged the Troubles in Ireland by arming &amp;  funding the IRA and literally helped cause the HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa  to become a pandemic by lobbying for no birth control and threatening  NGOS **from other countries**  that were providing birth control and real sex education. Seriously, W.  Bush threatened to stop partially funding the U.N. if they provided  condoms.\n\nThe only people more brainwashed than North Koreans are Americans. But keep those down votes coming and denying the truth.\n\nI am genuinely open to changing my opinion, so please, let's discuss!",

        "selftext": "I realize that I wouldn't be able to post this without the Internet, but I blame the Internet for a lot of problems in our society, including our increasing political polarization, a general lack of social skills, social isolation (before COVID), obesity, and a decrease in literacy.\n\nI say that the Internet has caused polarization because people on it have the ability to isolate themselves in \"echo chambers\" full of people whose political views are the same as theirs. It's easier for them to avoid encountering individuals with opposing views, and as a result they never learn how to confront opposing views and they become more and more extreme in their views. This has played no small part in the rise of Neo-Nazism on the right, socialism on the left, and people on both sides of the political aisle who get offended whenever they encounter an opinion that they don't agree with.\n\nBecause the Internet has consumed time that people used to spend socializing and doing things in real life, meaning that they have less social experience and less exercise, which makes them socially inept, isolated, and fat. Even before COVID, people reported feeling more isolated in the era of the Internet than in any other time in human history.\n\nFinally, the Internet and the rise of texting has led to a decrease in literacy in that people communicate primarily through texting, in which they often use emojis and abbreviations to communicate. The lack of communication using real words means that their reading and writing skills are impaired.\n\nTo be sure, the Internet does have its advantages. It has been indispensable to business during this pandemic, and without it the economy would grind to a halt. But under normal circumstances when there is no COVID, we would be better off if the Internet had never been invented.",

        "selftext": "So once again democrats are pushing for a $15 an hour federal minimum wage. They probably have the votes in the house, the president will sign off on it, but it seems somewhat unlikely that it will get past the senate. I think you could make a reasonable argument that most of America wants this increase, after all the democrats hold a pretty big majority in the house, which is elected in proportion to population. Where it's failing is in the senate, which was in part created to prevent states with large populations from imposing their will on states with small populations.\n\nTo me this seems like a case of everything working as intended. There's a policy that's widely supported but whose popularity depends quite heavily on what state you're looking at. The solution is to bypass the US senate and enact the policy in states whose voters elected representatives who actually want it. I counted nineteen states that have democratic majorities in both the house and senate, sixteen of which also have a democratic governor. None of these states have a $15 an hour minimum wage, which seems surprising given that their voters are largely responsible for electing the federal representatives who would make it a nationwide policy. Twenty three states have republican majorities in the house and senate, plus republican governors. They represent a minority of the population, but they clearly don't want this policy.\n\nTo me the solution seems obvious. Stop trying to force the $15 an hour minimum wage on states that don't want it, and enact it in blue states right away. You'll cover most of the US population and the change will be concentrated in places that actually want it. Minimum wage by state or even by county seems like a better solution anyway because it can be indexed to the cost of living. You need a lot more to get by in NYC or Seattle than you do in a small town in Mississippi.",

In general, they are more efficient and have better performance.\n\nHowever, batteries are a terrible energy storage method for vehicles. They dont store enough energy, they cant hold their energy for long enough, and theyre HEAVY. Whether the battery is charged or not, you have to haul it around. Its extremely inefficient for anything except daily commuting when you can charge overnight. Add onto that the environmental and supply chain issues of battery production, and making all cars battery powered is an idiotic, band-aid solution.\n\nVehicles, especially commercial and utility vehicles, need to be able to refuel quickly and store that energy for long periods of time. The only currently available green technology that allows this is hydrogen.\n\nVolvo, and many other car manufacturers who have made all-electric pledges, seem to focus entirely on battery vehicles and charging infrastructure. Neither Volvo or GM seem to make any mention of hydrogen vehicles in their press releases.\n\nObviously, creating a hydrogen refueling infrastructure is a massive undertaking that a single company would not be able to accomplish. However, especially in Europe, they could easily work together and make it happen with the support of regulators.\n\nIf automakers and regulators actually cared about developing the future of personal transportation, they would be investing in hydrogen. Instead, theyre putting their money into batteries because its an easy and trendy way to get good PR.\n\nObviously, there is room for battery powered vehicles in the market, but they are not the be all, end all solution many people seem to think they are.\n\nTl;dr\nHydrogen makes more sense than batteries for powering vehicles, automakers pledging to make all battery-powered vehicles are just trying to score PR points",

Skiers just cross country along. You can cross country ski but you can't cross country snowboard. Skiing is also much easier to learn, most people who try snowboarding just fall all the time which isn't cool. \n\nAnecdotally, in California in the 1990s, the snow boarding kids all were on teams within a year of starting and each team had at least one sponsored kid. It was like 8 and 9 year old.  To make a legit ski team at that age you had to have started at 2, which some kids did. That's the draw is that you can do a lot on a snowboard with a year's effort.  That why it's popular.  Skiing you take years to really develop.\n\nAnd here's another thing too: Moguls. Moguls are one of the most fun to watch and 'coolest' events in the Winter Olympics in my opinion. Skiiers absorb the bumps through their knees keeping an almost straight line down and keeping their upper bodies impossibly stable. Its an art. And then casually throw in a couple of jumps and air tricks halfway down. Snowboarding moguls is just....not elegant, practical or 'cool'. I invite you to look up YouTube videos of mogul boarding and you will generally get lessons on how to safely navigate down (or off) a mogul field on a snowboard. Now do the same for skiing...\n\nFor snowboarders, if they're  not scraping your way down a hill, they're hopping around like morons, and if they're not doing that you're sitting on your ass half the day. They're the skateboarders of the snow. The tricks are lame, they need your own man made park on the mountain. There is nothing a snowboarded can do in that park that a free style skier can't do. They can't negotiate moguls and they make a hash of the glades. There is no equivalent in snow boarding to Slalom, Super G, Downhill...",

Many Israelis and ardent pro-Israel activists believe the borders of Israel extend from the Mediterranean to the Jordan, and from the border of Lebanon to the borders of Egypt. In other words, according to their narrative, the current-day internationally recognized boundaries (i.e. the green line) or even the demarcated zones of the Oslo Accord are not real. This is seen in Israeli maps (including apps like Waze), their tourism memorabilia, their school textbooks, and everywhere! It's deeply embedded in the Israeli conscious. \n\nAt the same time, people who believe this say Israel has the highest vaccination rates. Or that Israel is a thriving democracy. \n\nIsrael can have one or the other, but not both. Either Isreal's borders don't include Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. OR accept that Israel is an apartheid state that segregates a substantial portion of its population, disenfranchises them, and withholds critical medical supplies like vaccines. \n\nOtherwise, you're basically pretending that millions of people (with, dare I say, rights) don't exist.

This means that you know both are actually in love and they proved it by signing a document stating money is not a priority. \n\n2. It would end ridiculous custody battles. If neither parent is abusive, both parents get 50/50 custody unless one parent abdicates or they come up with a different arrangement.\n\n3. No more awful court battles over money/property- If people can just divorce without needing to go through a court battle there would be less bitter ex's which is a good thing when kids are involved, and just better for peoples health.\n\nOver all I don't see a downside to making people set their terms before they get married.

Food is a necessity that is required to stay alive. I have NO money, and food having a price doesn't make me want to work harder, it makes me want to give up.  The fact that a certain group of people have nationalized agriculture and farming, and in turn destroyed SO MUCH land for the average human to remain self-sufficient on is agitating and depressing. It is a barrier to living a good life at this point. It WAS good, but now, in modern America, it is seen as a joke to grow your own food, be self sustainable, live \"off the grid\" It is nothing but a cultural SCREW UP in my opinion, as it is absolutely \\*\\*\\*impossible for a poor person to grow their own food.\\*\\*\\* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's my stance: I'm 25, unemployed because of many things.

If there were another option, I'd take it, but that option would be being granted my own land and resources, like these food owners were most likely born into. I cannot start from the ground up because the ground is OWNED.  I don't want to be reliant on anyone else for food, but since society is the way it is, I am FORCED to waste my life, time, money, energy, and effort on getting the proper fuel to remain living. I would MUCH rather be able to have a choice than instantly chalk up every penny I get to spending it on food.

        "selftext": "In the US (and most countries), there are a majority of white people who more or less want things to stay as they are, albeit with a few changes here and there.\n\nThen there are a few on the far-right who want to radically reform society (white ethnostates, etc) and a few on the far-left who want to radically reform society (ban meat, open borders, eradicate gender, turn well-respected people like George Washington and Dr Seuss into villains, replace our nation's history with \"black history,\" etc)\n\n_______________\n\nNow, if this is all true...seeing as the majority like things more-or-less as they are, you would expect them to push back against those who push hard for radical upheaval of American society.\n\nBut, for reasons I don't understand...this only seems to be true in one direction.\n\nAnd the direction this \"pushback\" is directed against is towards the side that's LESS likely to succeed in overturning American society.\n\nAND towards the side where, if they won, most of our life's wouldn't be all that much worse. (would I really suffer much if this country became a white ethnostate? Eh, not really.)\n\n______________________\n\nWhen a country singer calls a black FRIEND the n-word and some nosy asshole catches it on video, there's massive backlash, he's forced to give some fake apology and radios refuse to play him.\n\nWhen twitch changes \"women\" to \"womxn\" and people don't like it...they just go \"oops, sorry\" change it back, and no one boycotts them.\n\nWhy are subversive attacks on our society from the left so easily forgiven?\n\nThe problem is, we've trained these people to know there's no limit to how far they can push. They can advocate insane things like demonizing George Washington, banning meat, socialism, communusm, BLM behavior, racial subversion, gender subversion, reparations\n\n...and the MOST pushback they ever get is \"hmmmm nah not right now, try again in a few years after more white people die.\" And that's exactly what they do.\n\nThey push reparations right now, they don't get it, no problem! There's no pushback. They'll just wait and try in 2024. White people - what kind of strategy is this? We're guaranteed to lose. Even you moderates - we're guaranteed to lose.\n\n______________\n\nSo, if what I said about the average white American moderate is true, things should play out like I described (with heavy pushback against BOTH right and left when they advocate crazy shit). But it doesn't. So this means 1 of 2 things:\n\n1. I'm totally wrong, and most white people actually support all this insane left stuff. But I don't think that's true. When I see stories about \"schools suspending AP programs cause they're too white,\" even the leftists I know say \"oh no, I don't support that.\" Then why is there no pushback against it??? \n\nAnd if pushback succeeds, the most it ever succeeds in getting is \"okay, oops, we'll reinstate the program.\" The people who did it aren't crucified for life like Klansmen etc are. Why is the pushback so unequal? When we suffer WAY more from this mindset than we could ever suffer in a million years from Klansmen?\n\nOr..\n\n2) There's a systematic force in society that is stopping moderates from directing their backlash towards the left, and instead directs all of it to the right.\n\nIf moderates want to maintain the American they grew up in - to me, they have to make it very clear. When you slander George Washington, there are extreme consequences. When you fly a BLM fist flag and speak against whiteness, white privilege, etc, there are extreme consequences. When you try to eradicate gender, there are extreme consequences. When you advocate banning meat and veganism, there are extreme consequences.\n\nYou'll never be able to live a normal life again when you do this stuff. You'll suffer the same fate that \"racists\" currently do. You can't just go \"oops sorry\" when your leftist stuff doesn't work and then try it again in 4 years.\n\nBut that's not happening, and something's stopping us from doing it, and to me that doesn't make sense.\n\nSo...CMV",

Examples highlight that our enforcement of persons' rights is upheld well, and will be even more unbreakable with my policy put in place.\n\nAs scientific American introduces, \"when Draper took her analysis further and surveyed 293 members of the U.K. National Health Services Research Ethics Committees as well as 69 medical and social science researchers, asking them to consider if prisoners should be recruited for medical studies and about obstacles to including them, she discovered that the strongest factors motivating scientists and ethicists to exclude prisoners were not about coercion or restrictive guidance discouraging prisoner involvement. \" [1] Already, we see that informed consent is not a problem, and that ethically there is no issue.\n\nNot only so, the article furthers that it will give a better representation of critical data that we don't have. \"Hispanics, meanwhile, make up 16 percent of the population but only 1 percent of clinical trial participants\". There is a critical need for more clinical trial participants, and what better way to do it than the area that congregates the most of minority? \n\nIndeed, further papers combine to show that prisoners will do this out of the kindness of their hearts, and this will be furthered by the addition of lighter sentences. Science direct reports: \"a very high percentage of particularly vulnerable, mentally ill prisoners demonstrated adequate capacity to consent to research.\" [2] Even a Sweden study with prisoners remarks a similar result, stating that \"the results do not indicate that informed consent procedures ...was inadequately performed\". [3]\n\nThough our history has shown some abuse of prisoners, the modern society re-enforces the prisoners' rights and asserts the people's informed consent. Think about it this way. With greater amount of trials, we can get more insight into different people's reaction to the medicine. Even if we accidentally harm the prisoners, I argue that this would distribute the harm in a better way, since the earlier phases can be designated to the people who would rather take the punishment. They don't have a job. They don't have to take care of any one else. It would be much better for society for prisoners to accidentally get sick or hurt than a general person. \n\nIf this wasn't enough, yet another paper explaining the history tells of the evolution of the rights of prisoners. It says: \"current regulations (informed by the 1976Commissions ethical framework and findings) prioritize justicedefined hereas whether prisoners are treated fairly and whether they bear a fair share of theresearch benefits and burdensand respect for persons, which questionswhether prisoners have enough personal autonomy to give voluntary consent\" [4]. We've gone a long way since the beginning. Even though there are three minor critiques the author argues against the 2006 standards, these are only further standards to heap upon our current regulation. We should continue encouraging more prisoners to develop our framework. That way, we can establish a solid framework for testing people in general. Covering for their sentence would just be a bonus reward in the end.\n\nRemember that the prisons will be under greater scrutiny with more prisoners taking the drug trials. There will be greater motivation to encourage the standards of justice and consent with a greater population at stake. As the Belmont Report notes, the prisons must enforce the ethical regulations, which will be furthered under pro's world [5]:\n\n1. Respect for persons entails fully informed consent. The potential subject must be informed of, and understand, any risks involved. Prisoners receive explicit consideration; they must not be unduly influenced in any way.\n2. Beneficence entails the principles Do no harm and Maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms. If an experiment may cause harm to the subject, the risk involved must be carefully weighed against the possible benefits. If the protocols do turn out to cause significant harm, the experiment must end.\n3. Justice entails the equitable distribution of risks &amp; benefits. Vulnerable populations must not be exploited. For instance, poor persons should not be manipulated into participating in research that is most likely to benefit wealthy persons. Persons confined to institutions are explicitly protected from such exploitation.\n\nBoth community service and good behavior are commonly accepted as ways to reduce your prison sentence. Drug trials are no different, and it is reasonable that this act to benefit society will work out in the long run.\n\nSo in conclusion, our improvements to let prisoners freely volunteer to take drug trials should continue. It is a net benefit to society and enforces informed consent standards, putting greater pressure on prisons. Similarly, it also builds a strong framework in the future in case any civilians wish to also volunteer for drug trials.\n\nNow onto Con.\n\n1. scientificamerican.com/article/should-prisoners-be-used-in-medical-experiments/\n2. sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010440X03001718\n3. heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mlv20&amp;div=57&amp;id=&amp;page=\n4. repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2358&amp;context=faculty_scholarship\n5. hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/read-the-belmont-report/index.html",

        "selftext": " A very common narrative for at least the last decade or so is that when it comes to race, disparities in law enforcement = discrimination in law enforcement. Black folks are pulled over, stopped and searched, arrested, shot, brutalized, and given longer prison sentences than white folks, so it follows that law enforcement is systemically racist against black people. \n\nIt just occurred to me, though, and was confirmed with some quick research, that all of these disparities exist and are just as if not more lopsided along the metric of gender. Men are brutalized, arrested, pulled over, street stopped, and searched more often than women. [Source](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2019/05/14/policingwomen/). Men receive longer prison sentences for the same crimes. [Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentencing_disparity#Evidence). Men make up almost the entirety of those shot by police. [Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/585149/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-gender/). In each and every case the disparity is at least just as large between men and women as it is between blacks and whites, but frequently its much larger. This would seem to suggest that law enforcement isnt just systemically sexist towards men, but its actually *more* systemically sexust towards men than it is systemically racist towards black folks. \n\nThe knee-jerk reaction might be to say \"well men commit more crime so of course they have more negative interactions with law enforcement,\" but I've seen that explanation applied to racial disparities and generally speaking its dismissed out of hand as a racist far right talking point. \n\nChange my view.",

        "selftext": "The way I see it, a sanctioned fight (or match) is agreed upon before hand and has certain rules. \n\nYou can already be charged with assault and battery if you purposefully break those rules to hurt your opponent, i.e., kicking your opponent in the face in a boxing match is not only against the rules but also illegal. The same goes for sucker-punching an opponent in a wrestling match. When this happens, however, usually charges aren't pressed- the reason from top legal authorities is that the legal system has more things to worry about than someone breaking the rules in a sport that already entails the risk of injury from another person trying to hurt you (thus, this logic would NOT apply in tennis.) This logic was used after Mike Tyson but off part of Holyfield's ear. But let me hammer in this point here: There's a **huge** difference between a single event like this happening in the 'spur of the moment' and a prolonged, calculated regiment of steroid use prior to a match. \n\n\nThen you have rule-breaking that will ALWAYS land you an assault charge (or more) if you are caught. Filling your gloves with cement in boxing is obviously cheating and perpetrators have been charged with crimes before, such as in the sad case of Billy Collins and Luis Resto. \n\nI think steroid use falls somewhere in-between. There is an agreement that neither athlete will use steroids. The opponent did not consent to fighting someone with superhuman strength, and there is no excuse pertaining to \"heat of the moment\" or \"it was an accident.\" \n\nIf a combatant suffers an injury in a combat sport, and their opponent is proven to have used steroids and lied about it, then the opponent is guilty of assault and should face legal consequences.

He made a song implying she cheated shortly after. A documentary came out about Britney Spears and her struggles came out 3 weeks ago, which highlighted the bad things Justin has said over about 15 years with no context. \nNow the twitter mob and thousands of others say Justin is a misogynist and sexist for that. How? Like wtf? He doesnt hate women, which is the definition of misogyny, he just didnt like his ex lol. He was very immature and rude about it but we shouldnt  link misogyny and sexism to absolutely everything bad said about a certain individual women. It removes all context and meaning of those words.\n\nExample 2: Taylor Swift.\nContext: Taylor Swift was known to have dated many men throughout the years. Netflix basically made a joke saying goes through men faster than Taylor Swift or something along those lines. She replied with a tweet calling them sexist for that joke.\n\nThats a very rude joke but then again, how tf is that sexist? I dont know why Taylor would consider that sexist. It was just a joke that implied that Taylor Swift has had many boyfriends. First of all, whats wrong with having many relationships over the years? I dont think the joke had the intent of shaming Taylor for having many relationships or slut shaming her, Taylor and her fans just took it the wrong way. Its ok for Taylor to be upset because it was a mean joke, but by no means is it sexist\n\nThose words being tossed around randomly really devalues the meaning of the word, and using them to drag down certain people or celebrities for things millions of people do on the daily with little to no consequence is very stupid.\n\nLet me know if Im missing bits of information.

        "selftext": "Intro: If you don't know what Affirmative Action is, it's basically when you give a different set of policies  to a minority to increase diversity or employment. This is coming from a black teenager, and after giving it a ton of thought. When you think about it, it's incredibly racist by textbook definition. Allow me to explain.   \n\n\nAffirmative action sharply discriminates against people of many other races in the workplace and education system. Regardless of merit or how hard you worked, you could be rejected due to another black/Hispanic student due to the color of their skin. Despite them being less qualified for that job, they got in due to the color of their skin. Affirmative action isn't their just to help black people get a job, but it's moreover a spit in the face as it screams \"We don't expect you to get in that job anyway, so we'll set the bar lower for you.\" Ironically causing more racism, as the hard working... lets say Asian person doesn't get in because their race is a bit too overqualified for the job. Don't believe me? Lets take the court case *Students for fair admissions v. Harvard.*   \n\n\nHarvard creates a racial quota to keep the Asian population their lower for the sake of diversity. This became more and more evident as the Asian population their started to suspiciously dip lower and lower. In the lawsuit, the admission files were revealed and shockingly the students that were Asian scored higher than every other race that applied for Harvard. But their personality ratings were extremely low keeping them from entering the school. The same was applied for the white students as well. Who also worked hard to get their. Despite their hard-work, they were given a penalty for being so hard working for a rigorous school that is seen to value hard-work. Their race was a huge factor on why they couldn't get in. It wasn't blind, it was racism.   \n\n\nIt's reverse racism in it's finest ladies and gentlemen. Which would you have? A racially diverse workplace based on skin color? Or a intellectually diverse workplace based of people's own merit. (Frankly speaking, I think we need more intellectual diversity. I feel like people are a little too starved of information. Raised to believe that liberals are good and conservatism bad and vice versa. But that's a topic for another day.) Affirmative action destroys this and it's ironically pretty shitty to even people who come from a minority based background. It reinforces this idea and stereotype that we are \"stupid\" and need to be pampered to even be considered a nice paying job or role in society. Thus, permanently placing us in the lower side of the system affirmative action advertises to destroy. As a quote from Fredrick Douglass goes \"All I ask is, give him a chance to stand on his own legs! Let him **alone**! If you see him on his way to school, let him **alone**, don't disturb him!\"   \n\n\nPS: Well uh, thanks for attending my Ted talk. Mods, pls have mercy it's nearly 9:00 pm for me and I have a essay I procrastinated by making another one LOL. I'd love to hear thoughts on this though and I will try my best to respond.",

It is with this evidence, Pasta Alfredo being made with a pasta and a cheese based sauce, is a type of Mac and Cheese.\n\nBecause my view is as simple as that, I will combat some common counterpoints.\n\n* Mac and cheese is made with Elbow Macaroni, therefore Alfredo cant be Mac and cheese, because it uses other noodles.\n\nWrong. Mac and Cheese is quite commonly made with Cavatappi, Shells, or [branded, shaped noodles. ](https://images.app.goo.gl/Qy81Hcyhp3ajogP29) Additionally, the word Macaroni is simply another word for pasta, making all pasta shapes valid for Mac and cheese.\n\n* Alfredo was made first, therefore Mac and cheese is separate.\n\nIncorrect. Pasta Alfredo was invented some time between 1907 and 1910 by Alfredo di Lelio, roughly 700 years after the first recorder Mac and Cheese in a 14th century English cookbook which described a melted cheese and pasta casserole, named Makerouns, with modern Mac and Cheeses mostly attributed to a 1770 cookbook by Elizabeth Raffald, which utilizes a bechemel sauce \n\n* Mac and cheese has to be made with a roux/bechemel\n\nFalse. A simple Mac and cheese can be made by boiling pasta, straining it, returning to the saucepan, and adding in butter or milk, and a shredded cheese of your choice (personally I prefer Colby Jack), or referring back to [Scooby Mac](https://images.app.goo.gl/Qy81Hcyhp3ajogP29), which does not have a roux.\n\n* Mac and cheese is made with melted cheese, not a cheese sauce. \n\nFoolish logic. Referring back to [Scooby Mac ](https://images.app.goo.gl/Qy81Hcyhp3ajogP29), when preparing it, you dont melt cheese, you make a sauce out of a cheese powder. Furthermore, what cheese sauces are not made my melted, or at least emulsifying cheese?\n\nSo Reddit, with all my evidence laid out before thee, I challenge this site. Change my view.",

        "selftext": "I'll define racial as conversation pertaining to race. This can be conversations that are openly discussing race or possibly skirting around the issue with euphemisms or dog whistles. These conversations can be either serious or casual.\n\nI'll just give an example:\n\nThere were a a lot of Arab immigrants where I lived. Sometimes, male or female, I would make conversation with Arabs because I like geography and learning about different cultures. I had an Arab friend who opened my eyes to a lot of stuff. I would ask them what country they're from, or if they were from America. I did it not seeming like I'm interrogating them but people generally like to talk about themselves and if you lend an ear and a stand back, and are attentive people will tell you all sorts of stuff. Although I learned what fields are driving immigration to the area from the Gulf States based on a few convos and a particularly interesting one from a Jordanian nurse practitioner student who was on the front lines this year. I was able to deduce through many conversations that there's a class divide among Arabs in the area too. I also never asked too much about religion. I offended my friend and also a boss I had with that. So I didn't ask the Saudi Arabia girl I was hard cider why she drinks or at any point talk about anything war or Terrorism related. I just wasn't a dick about it.\n\nSome people believe I committed many microaggresions and mild racism. Some days I'm just the person who talks to anybody and everybody. One time I went to free museum night and just tried out inoffensive conversational trolling. I like to be a regular at places and develop a bond with the people I buy cigarettes or coffee from, or people I've seen in the same place more than twice. I know I get bored as hell working register, food service etc. so I talk to people where that's the case. A lot of times these people are minorities. Often not though. I also know that sometimes writing in a coffee shop I'm writing and other times I'm \"writing\" so I know if people are open to talking.\n\nAt the very worst I could possibly be offending someone, wasting their time, fucking up their train of thought (if they really were working). Though at no point was I being racist.\n\nThey keep moving the goal posts so nobody's ever woke enough and not only does that foster ignorance and division but it also shrinks the social consensus on left wing politics and alienates would be allies.",

Both presidents inherited the country in a far better condition than they left it in, and both presidencies were defined by crisis - ones that couldve either been prevented or managed much better. \n\nThe basis of my argument is not based on style, which Bush outclasses Trump any day, but on the fundamental direction they took the country in. \n\nTrump realigned the Republican Party away from neoconservatism, making it far less likely the US will find itself in another endless war for the foreseeable future. Prior to Trump, it was heresy to question the judgement of the Iraq War. Trump full on campaigned against it.\n\nTrump also did two things during the past year that will likely have major ramifications in the near future. One is he realigned the Republican Party on stimulus spending, opening the door for universal basic income down the road. The other is with Operation Warp Speed, it was proven that medications and vaccines can be fast tracked, which upends the red tape Big Pharma has always been behind and makes it likelier that new drugs or even cures for diseases like cancer get on the market sooner than they otherwise would have. \n\n\nTrumps presidency also inspired much higher voter turnout and political engagement - especially on the left. More Americans are voting than ever before. Granted, it mightve been a negative inspiration, but if more Americans are taking elections seriously, that can only be a good thing. \n\n100 years from now, no one alive will remember the Tweets. But they likely will have some form of UBI, drugs on the market for diseases that were fast tracked, and seen a long period where the US did not get bogged down in decades-long wars of choice. \n\nContrast that with Bush, who had the worst attack on American soil happen on his watch, invaded a country that had nothing to do with that attack at the cost of thousands of American lives and over a million Iraqi lives, destabilised the Middle East, and left office with the deepest recession since the Great Depression. Bush was dealt a bad hand, to be sure, but the choices he made had profoundly negative ramifications for the countrys trajectory long-term.",

In fact, he largely criticizes Republicans for disagreeing with his policies and saying that everything bad happening is their fault.

        "selftext": "The Japanese have demonstrated the viability of lab grown meats recently, replicating the taste and texture of steak from nutrients supplied to cultured flesh.\n\nWith the acceptance of meatless products like the faux sausage in Starbucks meatless breakfast sandwich and BurgerKings Impossible burger, meatatarians have shown a willingness to accept that as long as the product satisfies their requirements for taste and texture they will buy it.\n\nIt seems equally reasonable that vegans would find a sustainable lab grown product would be acceptable particularly as they often state that  they enjoy the taste of some meat products but that they abstain for moral reasons.  Given that both hydroponic vegetables, fruits, and now  lab cultured meats are grown from raw (non-animal) sources, perhaps vegans and vegetarians can reintroduce a tasty food source rich in B12 back into their diet.\n\nEdit: I confess to not really understanding what Deltas are and what to do with/about them.  If someone would be so kind as to explain, there are folks here raising really good points but I dont know if that applies to this sub or how (colour me embarrassed)\n\nEdit2: The B12 observation was an aside (and I will admit to a small crass attempt at marketing my position.). I realize that B12 is available in numerous ways.  Ignore the comment please as it is completely peripheral to the ethical issue behind this CMV.",

If its not (1) based on genitalia (see: trans people without dysphoria), or (2) based on levels of masculinity or femininity and gender roles (see: gender non-conforming people), then what is it based on? \n\nMany people will say gender is what you feel - you feel like a man or you feel like a woman. But man and woman have to have clear definitions in order for you to be able to relate to and identify with them. _So what is the definition of man and what is the definition of woman? All I see are things that gender is _not_, but nothing about what gender _is_. \n\nI honestly want to change my view because the concept of gender baffles me and I just want to understand it. So, I challenge you, try to define man and woman for me given what Ive mentioned above.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that there is also an argument that pronouns do not equal gender (see: lesbians who use he/him pronouns).

        "title": "CMV: Teachers are not Heroes",
        "selftext": "It's a generally accepted platitude that Teachers are some kind of Martyrs or Heroes, and I just think this is ludicrous. I think being a teacher is a very excellent and easy job anyone should be more than happy to have.\n\n\\-Teachers get summers off, winter breaks off, and only work 6 hours a day; even if they put in extra hours its no where near the standard work week. In my high school teachers would only teach 3x75min per day, which means even if they spent 75 min prepping/marking for each class its still not an 8 hour work day.\n\n\\-Most Teachers don't develop their own curriculum or Teaching plans and just copy guidelines given by Department of Education, or standard textbooks with curriculum outlines. Even if they do, most Teaching plans are just rehashes of previous years, and Teachers tend to collaborate to develop a single course.\n\n\\-Teachers are extremely well paid; where I am from the average public school teachers salary is 103K; the US nation wide salary is 61K, when the nationwide average salary for the college educated is 52K. Plus most all public school teachers have pension benefits, and the best medical benefits of any type of public employee.\n\n\\-Teachers have been the least innovative sector throughout my lifetime; virtually all innovation in teaching has come from outsiders like Khan Academy and Chegg; with all of the technological advances Teaching has not changed in the last 25 years as far as I can tell. True that the pandemic has forced many to adopt new practices(as it did for EVERYONE else); but as far as I can tell it is still the exact same gig except over zoom. I don't know what they could do differently...all I know is that it has been a stagnant field.\n\n\\-Teachers are largely failing, and that is independent of funding for schools; I could give a plethora of stats in this area but the median math literacy has been on a steady decline over the last 20 years, the US and Canada consistently underperform when compared to other developed nations in math, science and reading proficiency even though we are near the top for spending. And the percentage of native students occupying spots in Engineering/Math/Science fields has been on a decline as our students are less and less competitive on the global scale. I do not blame this all on the teachers since I know that a great deal of the funding for schools is lost in bureaucracy and Unions which is a whole other topic...but the headline is, our kids aren't learning as well as they should be, or even as well as they used to(I would also contend that teaching a subject like math is not a very cost intensive task, but I digress).\n\n\\-The supply of teachers is not met by the demand, it's tough to find a job as a teacher. Of course this is not a point against teachers, but if this was a career that was such a heroic sacrifice you would not have people lining up to do it.\n\n\\-Teaching is quite possibly one of the most stable jobs one could get. Steady raises included in union contracts, almost impossible to be fired, no punishment for being bad at your job.\n\nIn summary I don't have anything against teachers per se; I think it's an honest living. But the environment of sainthood we have created around teachers has made it so any criticism of them is sacrilegious in public discourse. Moreover, I think it's a very easy and well paying job when you compare it to what these people could have otherwise done with their degrees, and we needn't constantly proclaim they are making some grand sacrifice. I have had some incredible teachers in my life, some of them shaped me into who I am today;and for that I am eternally grateful...but I still wouldn't call them a \"hero\"",

        "selftext": "I opened this post with a paragraph about the times we find ourselves in, but that felt too soapbox-y and so I deleted it because this actually bothers me as what feels like a unique case that was worth openly discussing/debating. Also let me just get out of the way that I don't think there is any argument to be made for Jim Crow Era bullshit and jokes on the level of blackface. To me this specific issue becomes more about changing an artistic work for the sake of public appeal to the point of censoring it. \n\n\n**Here's what got the episode pulled: the opening has the gang playing a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and Chang (an incompetently malicious nutjob) is in a full cosplay as a Drow/Dark Elf. Shirley (the African American evangelical Christian) makes the joke of 'y'all gonna ignore the obvious hate crime over here?' If you haven't seen the episode it truly looks nothing like blackface with things like exaggerated lips or nose caricatures, it's a silver wig and elf ears and I'm pretty sure CGI that makes his whole body dark black like that Vantablack pigment that absorbs light. The entire actual (nerdy) joke is that this is in fact just cosplay of a real race in the world of DnD which fleshed out lore and Chang is just leaning hard into his character, to comic effect when his character gets unceremoniously murdered right as the first encounter happens. Shirley misunderstanding his intention is the set up, but there is no joke about POC here. However the implication alone was enough to lose access to one of the best episodes of the entire Community run.**\n\nI was fortunate to grow up in a very diverse community and work with some incredible people from all walks of life, I'm a registered independent but across the board liberal in my feelings on human rights and Healthcare and not turning the planet into an Easy-Bake Oven. I am white, and so one of the first things I had to accept as a kid was I can't completely understand how POC or minorities feel when they are discriminated against or made an outsider/'less-than' via dehumanizing 'jokes' a la Jewish space lasers and other crackpot gateway bs. I may immediately see why Native American warchief headdress and 'redskins' are extremely offensive while not really getting the hate over Jeep Cherokee, such is the limitation of my own culture. I know that seeing 'different' people as equal is only part of the story, and that there is a lot more to not just institutional biases but also subconscious discrimination and psychological mechanisms. Like Kyle jokes on South Park, 'I finally get it! I don't get it.'  I only throw all of this into the mix in an attempt to keep the focus on what seems to be a highly unusual and unique case to me, and to preemptively answer any generalizations you may feel tempted to make about someone making a post like this. \n\n\nSo bottom line there is no argument here for continuing to support artists with edgy racial jokes or rape culture, and there is an even stronger case against individual artists still profiting from their art in order to pursue their outrageous behavior, like Roman Polanski or Woody Allen or the author of Ruroni Kenshin (dude caught a fine for his CP collection and the manga continues serialization today).\n\nBut as a general rule of thumb,  I don't think tv or movies that 'didn't age well' belong in the same camp as something like confederate flag culture or slave owner statues, not least of all because the audience generally has to choose to engage with the art. I hate to find myself sounding like some of the folks yelling censorship at every business or government decision (looking at you anti vaxxers, nobody's looking at you flat earthers bc we've just given up on your lot).\n\nThese works still have plenty of cultural value, and it's perfectly fine and even desirable to be able to look at it and go, 'society had a long way to go, this was a big deal to make light of, etc.' As a matter of fact, I looked at this episode and thought there probably is a dumb kid out there who got his ass saved in cosplay because someone knew he was a Drow, not some neonazi parading around in a shitty high fantasy blackface costume. \n\nWhen every streaming service nukes an episode without warning, when they even renumber their seasons to make it impossible to notice, it is akin to censoring the artists and changing its impact by neutering any possible enjoyment or discussion of it. And it was all for a joke that wasn't actually a blackface or race joke. Idk where the line is in the slippery slope argument, but I'm pretty sure this is overshooting it.\n\nMaybe there's a side I'm not seeing? CMV.\n\nEdit: so I think there are some good points being discussed here! I'm working through them all. To clarify my own position a little I one hundred percent understand the financial and practical incentive for the removal, businesses do business. it's the justification for why viewers want it. I think part of what makes the argument so relevant now is that this isn't the age of TV censoring for the whole household at that hour, this is the age of streaming and deliberate consumer choice and parental controls for the saavy.\n\nA couple of things I want to pose to the group:\n\n*Would individual warnings on the episode, doing some type of 13 reasons why acknowledgement, etc. be considered as enough acknowledgement of the issue? Or is it just too offensive once flagged this way? \n\n*Would it be different if this was irl vs a scripted scene? As in, is it a misunderstanding/humorous situation if it happens organically, but immediately racist because it was written by a writer to create the scene, therefore the racial component they utilized poisons the whole thing? To me that just seems like you can't let art say anything about real parts of real life then. \n\n*Would it still be offensive or seen as blackface if Shirley wasn't there to say 'hate crimes' that sets up the parallel?\n\n*Are all depictions of dark skin tones in cosplay racist also? Does it matter if it's makeup vs masks and costumes? To me this is where execution matters. Do you look like something out of my nightmares or World of Warcraft, or do you look like some average schmuck who moonlights in Jim Crow plays?",

Like, let's freaking invest $10 billion a year in just researching policy initiatives and then using the results to drive better decision making. It makes absolutely no sense to me. And yes, both sides of the aisle are guilty of this, though maybe one more than the other. Am I missing something here? \n\nObviously, there are many good political reasons not to do this.

If I make any assumptions or mistakes in my comments, please correct me.\n\nIn my understanding, identifying as genderfluid means their gender changes or fluctuates over time, be that day to day or over months. By assuming different genders over time, one might alter their appearance and change the way they interact with other individuals in order to fulfill that identity, and by extension expect others to treat them in a certain way.\n\nChanging your clothing or the way you portray yourself is only conforming to an outdated view of binary genders. You should be able to act and dress as you like - if you are rocking something, I will tell you you're rocking it! (not that my opinion should change anything) - but doing so is purely an expression of your personality rather than your genderfluidity/gender at that time. \n\nTo me, this identification seems rather needless. I appreciate the challenge of identifying yourself at any specific point on the gender spectrum. But I would argue it is more productive to conclude you cannot pinpoint that gender rather than adopt different genders on different days.\n\nPlease change my view - I want to be as accepting and understanding as I can be.",

Having it primarily a tax for large publicly traded stocks, that benefit the employees of both small businesses as well as biggest employers (regardless direct or through an intermediary). I would also count executive compensation and any stock buybacks as taxable profits, this would lessen the ability to skirt the tax that would fund the subsidies to the minimum wage workers. Small businesses wouldn't be liable for the tax but their employees would benefit from higher income. \n\nThe additional wages would be paid quarterly directly to the employees bypassing the employers altogether, I would also put it as criminal violation of the supervisor who signs off on the hours worked would be liable for kick backs or other means of wage theft which will be made more difficult to do with employer reporting the hours worked. To avoid hourly workers being switched to salary, there would be doubling the overtime threshold from ~$35,000 to $70,000, overtime is owed for salary employees after 30 hours while hourly employees would remain at 40 hours. \n \nThe goal should be a return to where wages are seemingly tied to productivity, as it was nearly 40 years from the 1930s until late 70s. Changing my view would be a more effective means to achieve this goal, not trying to convince me that minimum wage workers deserve to be paid subsistence wages, or other criticism of the goal rather than attempting to persuade me a better means of achieving the goal.

But it has failed in being a relief to its users, a refuge for people who have nothing else to do on a Monday morning driving to work. (Not recommended). But Reddit is different. It has depth. Reddit, advertised as the Front Page of the Internet, is just that: the internet, balled up into this one site. It fosters meme culture. Instagram steals from the popularity. It is filled with debates and arguments, both friendly and hostile. Facebook is too much of the latter. It isnt some hollow posting site with no meaning. Snapchat... is.

Personally, [I believe that the evidence behind the accusations against Christian Porter are inconclusive](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/lxx0yu/do_you_believe_the_rape_accusations_against/gpr0qkx/?context=3), but the way that the Coalition acted isn't the way they'd act if they were innocent.

While I vote for left-wing parties anyway, even they have their own sexual assault problems. For example, [Emma Husar was excluded from ALP consultations on their sexual assault policy](https://twitter.com/emma_husar/status/1364820603354554370?s=20), [Bill Shorten is also accused of rape](https://theconversation.com/shorten-outs-himself-as-labor-figure-in-rape-investigation-30781) and [even the Greens have politicians accused of rape](https://newmatilda.com/2019/12/19/greens-botch-apology-over-investigation-into-jeremy-buckingham-sexual-assault-claims/).\n\nAs mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Australia_/comments/ly6sdg/cmv_australia_needs_royal_commissions_or/), I do not expect a proper investigation to be carried out, because it will offend people. However, I also don't expect the Coalition, the ALP or the Greens to clean up their act either, because no side can claim the moral high ground on this. If no side can claim the moral high ground on this, what incentive is there for any of them to improve? After all, many people here vote on policy, and rape allegations don't seem to be a factor in people's voting choices since all 3 major parties have such allegations.\n\nThat being said, I also have doubts that new parties will be able to avoid such scandals. Even if the Australian people vote for new parties in protest, there is no framework stopping new parties from having similar scandals, and there is no incentive for them to stay squeaky clean if they can just point the finger at other parties and claim that they are equally bad.",

        "selftext": "Yesterday, Twitter introduced me to the #superstraight meme movement, a (half-satirical?) group of people who are claiming a new sexuality, superstraight, and inclusion in LGBT+. Superstraight individuals, they say, are attracted *only* to cis people of opposite sex; they are also claiming supergay, superlesbian, and superbi identities. (Talk about a sentence I never thought Id write...)\n\nAside from the fact that this whole thing seems like obvious trolling that many people are falling for hook, line, and sinker, its central premise does seem to reflect the near-constant CMV posts about whether not wanting to date a trans person is transphobic. (As I write this, theres a highly upvoted post now.)\n\nThe view Id like changed, though, is a little more meta: namely, this whole debate seems largely manufactured/online. Ive seen far more online debate/complaint posts about how trans people expect someone to be attracted to them and how not being attracted to them isnt transphobic, than posts or real-life situations by trans people saying that people not wanting to date them is transphobic. In short: I think this whole thing is an emotional response to a largely manufactured concern. \n\nIt feels like the manufactured logic is: If trans women (say) are women, and Im attracted to women, but Im not attracted to a trans woman, Im invalidating her identity. But no one is attracted to all members of a group, and Ive never heard anyone seriously claim that someone must be attracted to a trans woman or else theyre a transphobe. \n\nMaybe to put it more succinctly: it seems like people genuinely have feelings about this topic and love to debate it, but all that debate is far more frequent than the actual thing happening itself.",

I've taken plenty of college courses that were helpful and interesting but 99% of the college experience is either entirely irrelevant to the private sector and career progression or is taught/formatted in such a way that it is incomparable to job experience. I think schooling should exclusively target work ethic and problem solving. I've gotten jobs that I've been entirely unqualified for just by demonstrating work ethic and an ability to learn quickly. If you looked at my school performance you might think that I am a deranged drug addict yet I have consistently over-performed in the private sector. In a few roles I've definitely felt disadvantaged without a dedicated 4 year degree but that was never something I couldn't make up with 6 months on the job. I personally believe that 18yos should sell their labor for cheap to employers with the understanding that part of their pay is pure work experience.

I'm going to breakdown why all of this is so problematic to say.\n\n***'Fuck China!'***\n\nWhen you use the name of the country you automatically include the people in the country, not just a specific group of people. China has a population of 1.4. billion. Many are equally disgusted and some may not even know about it. Instead of pointing the blame at 1.4 billion, why not just point the finger at the CCP or just Xi Jingping.\n\n***'Let's start a war with China!'***\n\nWho's going to be fighting the war? Who's going to die? You don't think there are gonna be major risks of potentially starting a nuclear war? During WW2, many Japanese Americans were held in interment camps. What's going to stop this happening again to Chinese-americans? This is probably gonna end up really bad and I think war should only be the very last option.\n\n***'Let's cut all economic ties with China!'***\n\nNeedless to say, this is going to have massive economic after effects. I'm no expert but I think this should be approached carefully by people that know what they're talking about, not some random individuals on reddit.\n\n**But why is it going to make stuff worse for Uighurs?**\n\nAs we've already seen since the start of the pandemic, asians around the world have been affected massively. Hate crimes have risen by 1900% to asian-Americans. If this is not a concerning figure then I don't know what is. Most of the time people can't tell the difference between east-asians and so everybody is affected by the actions of a government thousands of kilometres away. If you really wanted to help them, you wouldn't be writing angry stuff on the internet but contacting your politicians and educate yourself and those around you about the situation.\n\nSo please, I've already experienced so many micro-agressions from people since January. Supporting and suggesting stupid conspiracy theories are only going to motivate hate towards asians and make stuff worse for us.",

This creation, according to the Genesis story, included the sexual distinction between men and women. \n\nNow, it is manifestly the case that heterosexual sexual relationships possess certain natural qualities which do not exist in homosexual sexual relationships, namely the ability to have children. It is also true that the opposite cannot be said; homosexual sexual relationship do not have any natural qualities which are not equality possessed by heterosexual sexual relationships. Thus, it can be said that one is naturally superior to the other by virtue of this unequal distribution of natural powers.\n\nTherefore, for Christians or Jews to say that both relationships are, or ought to be held as, equal, is to admit that God made a mistake in his perfect creation by ordaining one of these relationship as naturally superior, as shown above. If they did, they would be required to abandon their belief that God is perfect.\n\nImportant to note that this argument does not address whether or not they must believe in the sinfulness of homosexual sexual relationship, but only deals with the equality between homosexual and heterosexual relationships.\n\nI also dont deny the existence of certain Jewish or Christian groups who hold to the equality of these relationship, but I do believe their beliefs to be internally contradictory.",

I think its the dumbest thing ever.  Youre literally promoting the fact your ancestors fought to keep slaves and destroy this country.  I know theres an actual organization called sons of confederate veterans and a quick google search shows that a bit of the proceeds from these plates goes to support that organization.  There happens to be a sons of Union veterans organization and as a northerner Id be happy to support such an organization to counteract neo-confederates.  I noticed northern states dont offer such plates in the Union version.  Id love to slap a Illinois Sons of Union Veterans plate on my car and drive through Tennessee or Alabama like they do to us.  The north won the war after all.  If the losers want to honor their ancestors we should be able to honor ours too, and ours fought to preserve the Union and without their sacrifice, this country might not exist.",

The countrys economy is way too diverse for a blanket minimum wage. Hence it should be up to the state.\n\nYoull also notice how fucking expensive it is to live in States with minimum wage that trends higher. No one likes to admit it, but raising minimum wage will also contribute to inflation. Why? More disposable income means more opportunity for landlords to scalp their tenants in areas with NIMBYs and low housing inventory. How? They have so much income data on their potential clientele. Rent is becoming HUGE problem in Phoenix... while the housing market is following close behind.\n\nInflation isnt some magical overnight thing. Its slow and hard to measure, but one thing is for sure weve all experienced higher food pricers lately as well as rent. Minimum wage hikes will only exacerbate this.\n\nThe simple logic goes like this:\nWage goes up&gt; Disposable cash goes up &gt; Demand for inelastic products increases from new money&gt; prices goes up &gt; 15/hr means jack shit now after this feedback loop goes on for 5-10 years.\n\nMy proposition? Bring cost of living down to match current wages.

Compare this to the myriad of opportunities one has when studying something STEM related; these often teach fundamentals in many disciplines, especially since mathematics is pretty pervasive in the studies, and required for many different types of work.\n\nI fail to see how organized, high-level education and research in areas such as religion, national history, or gender studies can even compare to research in mathematics, chemistry or computer science. \n\nNote: I don't think the study of these areas should be outlawed or anything, I do, however, think that we as a society should stop advocating for and encouraging young people to study them, it is counterproductive both for society, which loses a potential engineer/researcher/developer and for the people studying it, as they most likely end up getting work where their education's effect is either negligible or non-existent. \n\nI get that we should let people study whatever it is they want, but I think we need to stop pretending like these degrees and fields of study are just as valuable as STEM fields, or sometimes, even at all.\n\nPlease, change my view.\n\nTL:DR: STEM fields help advance technology and humankind as a whole, humanities just propagate themselves and only rarely create valuable culture.",

        "selftext": "I consider myself rather liberal and I am 100% onboard with gender and gender roles being a social construct.\n\nHere is how I understand it (Just in case my being wrong about this is why I am having trouble getting the \"bigger picture\"): Throughout history, because of biological differences (strength, vision), men and women primarily had different roles in they communities. these roles became Men(gender) and women(gender) and are separate from male(sex) and female(sex). As technology advanced, humanity no longer had to rely on their bodies to survive as much- our small biological differences mattered less and less in everyday life, and therefore we were able to break out of their traditional gender roles. Men can do \"traditionally\" female work and vise versa without the community being in danger of collapsing. This does not stop with \"work\" though, because the way we were raised and how we were expected to behave was due in large part with the duties we were expected to perform when we got older. Tradition has caused this to change to occur slower, but it is happening and there is a growing acceptance in women who are strong physically/in leadership roles and men being empathetic/nurturing. We'll get there soon and (I think) we have to be patient with rural/less developed communities where its members have not yet had the chance to break out of their traditional gender roles.\n\nI have heard that some people with gender dysphoria don't feel like a woman/man. wouldn't that be a problem with \"society\" an not that person individually?\n\nFor example: I am part of a minority group and growing up my family commented on how I don't like the things (food, activities) they- and by extension- my race enjoy. This troubled me for a long time, I asked myself, \"am I REALLY this race? I feel totally separate from it and can't relate to it at all.\"\n\nI was able to reconcile this difference not by changing ME (I'm not the problem), but by changing what it means to be my race. Basically how I am will become the new definition of what it means to be part of my race.\n\nSide point:\n\nBy \"Transitioning to a different gender\" Aren't the gender roles being reinforced? Like if I have to transition to a man to feel strong, doesn't that mean women can't be strong? making it harder for feminine men and masculine women to be accepted?",

This are jus a few examples, I believe nationalism is rising in most european countries.\n\nWe also see a radicalisation of islam. Muslims seem to not be tolerant with christians. Hagia Sophia, being turned into a mosque, after almost 100 years of it being a musem, shows this. And Turkey it's a secular country. Terror attacks in France (Samuel Patty, Nice attacks)...The support from muslim comunities, this is what shocked me. They condemn the attacs, but, they also mention that their prophet was insulted. There are no \"buts\" when it comes to terror attacks.\n\nWe can also see a rise of muslim comunities (mostly due to imigration), where they demand rights ( to be governed by Sharia ). It does seem to be a problem for europeans and this might be the reason why we see a rise in nationalism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will share my point of view and present my argument.\n\nI have learned that, being a muslim, it's the same as being a german, an english, a french. This is their identity. Christianity, it's part of my indentity, but, my nationality comes first\n\nI believe that, the term islamophobia it's being used wrong. This isn't an irational fear of islam. People have alot of good motives to not want islam in their countries. Mostly because we are christians, and under islamic rule, we are considered second class citizen. I would not call this islamophobia, but, common sense. It's a system that doesn't promotes equality, but equity (allegedly).\n\nIslam does seem to not be only a religion, but, a total solution for mankind. Which, I do not agree with. Comunism said the same thing and I believe it was far better than islam. Comunism on paper promotes an utopic society. Islam doesn't even sound good on paper.\n\nTo show that there is no equality I will present a few examples\n\nEgypt it's considered tier 2 when it comes to freedom of religion.\n\n[https://timep.org/commentary/analysis/the-reality-of-church-construction-in-egypt/](https://timep.org/commentary/analysis/the-reality-of-church-construction-in-egypt/)\n\nBy islamic law, christian men can't marry muslim women, but, muslim men can marry christian women.\n\nChristians have to pay jyzia, not zakat, as muslims do. Clear discrimination. No equality.\n\nThere are more examples of this.\n\nI would like to hear your point of view in regards to islam in Europe. Is it becoming a problem ? What solutions are there ?\n\nIf there are muslims on this sub, why do you think there is a rise in nationalism ? Do you have secular values ?

I recognize my privilege, but I think that many people do not realize how bad the lives are of rural people living in Brazil.

I think anyone who seriously says \"I would rather have nature documentaries than fewer starving people\" is selfish.\n\nAnd then when people say \"Brazil needs a new government that won't do this\" it makes me upset because they are arguing against democracy. This is what the people want. Obviously Bolsonaro is an awful person, but if (again if) he represents the desires of the people living in Brazil, who are we Americans to tell him to do it otherwise? Maybe the problem is better education for their people. But that's a different issue entirely. \n\nAgain, I recognize that the solution is to stop people starving perhaps another way, but people who complain that it's a bad government don't understand the concept of democracy or sovereignty. \n\nI do think that we should find a solution that works for everyone, but complaining about Brazil or imposing sanctions that will hurt their people more isn't the solution. \n\nObviously this is a controversial opinion, and I want to change it, but I can't see any reason not to. The rainforest is not America's to control. It is the people of Brazil's. Who are we to tell them what to do? That to me is neocolonialism at it's finest. \n\n\n\nP.S.

I cannot think of any reason anyone would want to do that if not for the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecoming a dentist is hard as it requires you to be a top student in high school, and study for years about...teeth, not the most interesting topic in the world. Studying vigorously on such topics isn't typically fun/interesting. Whilst there are certainly execptions, I dont think many would pour in years of life into understanding teeth if not for the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat we always hear from doctors are: they aspired to become a doctor to change the world, to help people, or to cure xxx diseases because their family/friends suffered from it when they were a kid.

Also, it sounds disingenuous to say 'I wanted to cure toothache since I suffered from it as a child.' It is like saying you wanted to become a doctor because you caught a flu when you are young.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt also isn't likely for one to become a dentist because they got rejected by med school, as dentistry usually has higher requirements that med school itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI genuinely cannot think of why anyone would want to be a dentist apart from its money prospect.",

I stand with my Jewish brothers and sisters, her blatant ignorance saying that she faces the same struggles by being a republican as  Jews faced during Nazi Germany is very unsettling (I mean, it's kind of mind blowing). HOWEVER, I feel like using these as a catalyst for her being fired is a mis-step in cancel culture. Especially while others in the industry who have made the same, and often worse, commentary haven't been fired. Where's the consistency? People make mistakes, some of them more damaging than others, but what sets individuals apart is how they react to learning they have hurt people. Now, I know she was warned multiple times about what she posts on very public social media accounts, and she disregarded each warning. There are grounds there for people to be very upset, and yes, this should have been *part* of the reason she was fired. \nBut common, she's about one of the worst actors I've ever seen. She has NO depth, no good line delivery, she can't even come close to rising to the level of her once fellow costars. Disney should have not been on the edge of their seat waiting for her to make a mistake and use that as the reason they fired her. She should have been out because she brought the whole show down. I have no personal love or hate for the woman, but I do detest her acting ability, or lack there of.\nFiring her over huge political issues turns a bad actor into a martyr. Which is exactly what she's become. She doesn't deserve to be a martyr and spew her \"woe is me\" pity everywhere. \nThis is my opinion. Is it flawless? No. Do I believe it? Yes.\n\nGina Carano is a terrible actress.\nThe end.",

        "selftext": "I see an embryo as the same as an egg or a sperm, something that can become a person at some point, but it not yet.  It's not a person, it's an \"it\", and can be disposed of in the same manner as a tumor.  Does it have unique human DNA?  Yes.  Is that important?  No.  Identical twins are not half a person, and chimeras (fraternal twin embryos that fuse into a single embryo at a very early stage of a development and have 2 sets of DNA mixed together) are not 2 people. \n\n*Why* do I believe an embryo is not a person?  Because I believe a person is their mind.  Mind = brain = you. Everything that makes you you is contained in your brain and nervous system, and nowhere else.  Alter a persons mind/brain, alter who they are (e.g. Phineas Gage) .  Destroy the mind, destroy the person.  No mind, no person.  This applies to embryos and brain-dead (not coma, but real brain death) humans.  They can both be unplugged because they are not a person.\n\nEmbryos, and even fetuses to a certain level of development, do not have the necessary brain structures to support consciousness or conscious processing of stimuli. There is no thought, no feeling, no *nothing*.  An embryo and early fetus is mentally inert.  It has not yet come online.  An embryo is still a seed of a person.  How do we know this?\n\n&gt;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/201429\n\n&gt;Pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus. Neither withdrawal reflexes nor hormonal stress responses to invasive procedures prove the existence of fetal pain, because they can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing. Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks gestational age, while electroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks.\n\nThat means that before 29 weeks, a fetus has not mentally come online yet, in the same way a sperm or egg has not mentally come online yet.  There is a long chain of things that have to go right before a person starts to exist in late pregnancy: gametogenesis (development of egg and sperm in the would-be parents), fertilization, implantation, growth, etc. BUT, once there is a person there, that person deserves full rights.\n\nSo I am 100% against abortion after, say, 27 weeks or so, but that is so late in a pregnancy that you just have a delivery at the hospital.\n\nAnd yes, I am aware that a fetus can be born as early as something like 22 weeks and can survive with modern medical technology, but I still dont think thats a person, because I dont think it matters if it's inside or outside the womb:  No ability to consciously react to stimuli, no person, can be disposed of with impunity.  Ability to consciously react to stimuli = person, and killing it = murder.\n \nThen theres the counter-argument about well, what about if youre sleeping, or in a coma?  You cant react to stimuli!  Can we just kill you?  No, because you still have the necessary brain structures to consciously react to stimuli.  There is also continuity of self:  you are the same person who went to bed last night, you have memories of yesterday.  People who wake up from comas are (more or less) the same people they were before.  They were offline for a while, but theyre now back online.  It was a pause.  An embryo was never online to begin with.  A brain-dead person will never be online again.",

Keep in mind I am not supporting every action/idea that is associated with those communities.\n\nThis seems to include individuals who are heterosexual, homosexual, and apparently bisexual (which I suppose just excludes intersex people? Idk how that works lol)\n\nI believe that people are not exactly in the wrong or morally reprehensible, per se, by claiming this as their sexual orientation, and are being wrongfully accused of hate by extension. It was to my understanding (although I am young, relatively), that sexual orientations have often defined themselves on the basis of sex (heterosexual and homosexual). I understand that this is probably wrong/different nowadays due to critical gender theory being the new way of defining things, but I dont believe that you can take away someones conditioning (be it innate or sociological/social conditioning) through insults/pejoratives, shaming, or anything really, as certain LGBTQ+ circles are currently doing. I point to conversion therapy for this - would you tell a gay man that they are wrong for rejecting post-op FtM Men as sexually attractive partners? Would you yell, scream, and say that he is transphobic for refusing to date FtM men due to his orientation? I would hope not.\n\nIf you need evidence that the opposing viewpoint to mine exists, I'll be happy to oblige in the comments.\n\nI hope to understand how this may be a flawed point of view, because I'm tired of debating with other teenagers about how it's not hateful to claim an orientation surrounding the act of solely dating the opposite sex, regardless of gender identity or expression. Most people have just made the argument that the terms heterosexual and homosexual have outdated definitions, as they exclude transgendered people, and I still believe that people who have those orientations have the ability to maintain a standard revolving around sex, without being hateful to trans people.\n\nYes, I also understand the 4chan thing, and that some users on those subs can be hateful towards trans people. I'm not supporting the community, I'm supporting the moral character of the ideology which I outlined above, I have seen people that there who believe in this (sexual preference as defined by sex), who support trans people and are not hateful towards them - even people who date trans people of the opposite sex while maintaining this orientation and belief.\n\nCMV!",

Now all of us would agree that a mother who does that deserves jail (barring if she has any mental problems). Now for the Pro-lifer, if a fetus has the same status, then getting an abortion is no different from that. It might look and feel less violent/more detached, but that should not mean anything. If I kill a person by strangling them, or by hiring a hit-man who poisons their food, my moral responsibility is the same.\n\n Meaning that if a mother should be punished for shooting a toddler in the face, she should be given the same legal punishment for aborting a fetus. Whether that sentence is 25 years, or even the death penalty.\n\nSo to be pro-life and not support legal punishment of a woman who aborts the same way you would punish a woman who kills a toddler, is to be logically inconsistent and a hypocrite.

A very distinct thing happens in India: cows are sacred and dogs often seen as a pest. \n\nFurthermore, our brain is built to perceive human-like characteristics. A cute dog, which often is a result of artificial breed, is cute because it has baby-like characteristics (as disproportionately big eyes). A pig is as smart as a dog, but we dismiss them as friends because they're not as cute. We too often attribute illogical mental characteristics to non-human animals, as guilt, complex emotions, etc. This anthropomorphization is also the reason why we cringe on the thought of eating apes: they're too similar to us.\n\nIf we wanted to be the most unbiased possible when valuing animal, maybe we'd value the ones more capable of deep emotions or of high intellect...  We'd let alone... Apes... Crows... Elephants, dolphins... Dogs and cats... Pigs... Octopus are pretty smart too... Hmm... (Then we'd arrive at the sorites paradox)... Cows... Bunnies... Hamsters and rats are alike... Only animals though? Bees are remarkably smart... Maybe we should respect more flies... And mosquitoes... etc, etc...\n\nIf we managed to harvest energy from the sun to live without hurting other animals, awesome! But they won't care. They'll keep eating themselves, reproducing vehemently , everything through instinct, because every creature is a selfish construct of self-preservation - a simple piece on the energy harvesting cycle of nature (plants harvest the sun, herbivores harvest plants, carnivores harvest herbivores.)\n\nWhat I mean is that there is no fundamental value on any life form. However, through a human point of view (which thus far is the only known point of view), the importance of our kind is of a basilar importance, and we shall act accordingly. Preserving our sanity and wellbeing over everything also means respecting the nature, because it brings us health and happiness. Who acts poorly against nature is a result of ignorance or/and blindness. There should be pride on being a human - let's for once focus on the positive things of being a human: the capability of dreaming, of wishing for more, of thriving for a better future... Damn, we'll end up exploring the universe (as we managed to explore the oceans when we had no idea how the world was).

For instance, farmers have a surplus of whatever theyre growing so just take it down to the store and leave it with the understanding that everyone will take what they need and no more. Then while youre there take what you need and no more. Other farmers and producers will have already sent the stuff they dont need anymore of so grab whatever. \n\nMajor companies can still exist too. Contrary to popular belief people would still go to work out of sheer boredom and liking what they do. I personally like my job and would keep going and I know other people that would too. Employers would also be forced to vastly improve working conditions as people arent going to work for shitty companies anymore because they arent getting paid. Theyre just there because they want to be. \n\nThe only issue would really be assigning housing  but I think in a society like this it would be less of a problem than youd think. There are people who like smaller homes and people who like bigger ones. Theres a house for everyone somewhere that they want to be. I personally like living in apartments more than actual houses so Ill gladly take a smallish apartment provided I can keep my cat. Plus there will be people out there who just love to build things and in a world like this they might group up and start building houses and apartments and whatever else is needed with the materials that now dont cost an arm and a leg which means more places for people to live and that means less people on the streets and from experience I can tell you that I do much better at keeping a job when I have food in my stomach and a warm place to sleep than when Im living in a car and stealing apples from wherever I dont think will miss them. \n\nI just genuinely think if we ditched money the world would function better and everyone would be happier.

Indeed on every post of this sort you'll find upvoted comments about how the \"bar is on the floor\" or others basically outright saying something to the effect of \"isn't it terrible men suck so bad that we're impressed by this kind of stuff.\" \n\nBy way of analogy how this reads to me would be like an almost exclusively male populated sub sharing stories like \"hey, guys, I'm dating this girl and she *didnt* fuck all my friends and then falsely accuse me of rape! Isnt that amazing!?\" and then the comments are chalk full of people implying that's common behavior among women; another might be a sub populated almost exclusively by white people sharing a story like \"we hired a new black guy at work, but surprisingly he's actually a really hard worker and I dont think he's stolen anything from the supply closet!\" and then comments bemoaning how the prevelance of black people being terrible has caused us to be impressed by such things. \n\nFrankly if you posted gender swapped or racial versions of the bigotry of low expectations posts you see against men on 2XC on most other subs the post would get removed and youd get banned; if the whole sub was routinely posting and upvoting them to the front page the sub would probably get banned or quarantined. But 2XC has been chugging along for years with stories like this hitting the front page every few days and I've never seen anyone inside or outside of 2XC remark that it seems even vaguely sexist. I dont get it.",

Their ancestors rose to the top, a thousand years ago, and were often quite brutal. In the last 200 years, the royal family has led the Empire and its colonies. Colonialism can again be likened to narcissistic abuse: one individual/state oppresses another and makes them completely subservient/lose their individual rights.\n\n\\-She was a prime target for being scapegoated: she was the successful--at first popular--outsider.\n\n\\-No one who sees her as a villain is interested in discussing/hearing more information. They've already made up their mind. If she says she was feeling suicidal? Apparently, she's an attention seeker. But I bet if Charles or Harry were to say they felt suicidal, this half of the British public and the tabloids would blame Meghan for being a \"bully\". Collective narcissism?",

They always move *slightly* slower than the player, which means that if you're fully focused on moving alongside them you're going to have to move in an irritating, halting manner. \n\nThis is acceptable in pure escort missions, since there are most certainly going to be interruptions on the way that cause you to slow down, but not all missions where this becomes a problem belong to this group. \n\nInstead, many have *sections* where your only objective is to follow an NPC somewhere (presumably talking on the way) without knowing the route or destination.\n\nThis is where this problem is, in my opinion, at its worst - falling behind is not really a possibility you need to consider since the player has nothing to do but follow the NPC, but even if it happens, you can easily catch up by simply switching to a faster movement mode like sprinting.\n\nI'd like to hear what game designers have to say about this. I've only ever experienced the issue in question from the player side of things. The possibility that this is a lesser evil is one I'm ready to accept - so long as I know *why.*",

On top of that, you can't really talk about your hard work or your collaborative nature, since basically every student says that.\n\nDespite requiring applicants to differentiate themselves from the rest, many universities make no attempt to do the same. Let's take University X as an example. I went to their website on a page which said \"Why X\" (this was sent to me in an email from them, btw). One of their reasons was dedicated professors who love to teach. Another was great facilities that many other first-year students don't have access to. In my opinion, these are just really generic.

At some point, language and culture evolve and move past a point but the law, apparently, stays the same. \n\nFor another, the idea that it should be the states responsibility to regulate the quality of content in media is unfounded and authoritarian and lets face it, this *is* a matter of quality of content, because obscene material might be unpleasant, but it doesnt actually harm anyone or infringe on their rights to be exposed to unpleasant content. It isnt about protecting people from anything except for what the state deems as unpleasant a definition which should be entirely subjective and left to the free market to decide.\n\nWhich brings me to my other point. If we didnt have this federal regulation, does anyone really think that there would be intense swearing and naked people all over tv and radio? No way! The consumer still exercises feedback over the media in the form of viewership. The idea that media would suddenly start filling their shows with things that are genuinely horrible to look at, like *two girls one cup* for example off the top of my head, is just silly. There are things other than obscenity that upset us. You could legally broadcast a horrifically loud sound byte of someone screaming while displaying images of creepy monsters, á la horror films. But people dont typically do that without a warning or a rating to alert viewers to the possibility of upsetting content, because its in their best interest not to piss people off. \n\nThe market can regulate its own content in this way, and the fact that we pay taxes for a federal commission to sort though our media for us like dogmatic parents is both wasteful and insulting.",

This is the majority of the cartoon's runtime.\n\n\\- Toward the end of the cartoon, Pepe does something that makes the cat amorous towards him, usually because he'd somehow masked his scent.\n\n\\- Then the cat, finding Pepe extremely attractive, now amorously pursues him and refuses to take \"no\" for an answer, which puts Pepe off.\n\n\\- The cartoon ends with the roles reversed, and Pepe is getting the treatment that he subjected Penelope to. Justice is served.\n\nThere are very few exceptions to this formula.\n\nTo sum up, I don't see how Pepe encourages sexual assault any more than Marvin the Martian encourages planetary annihilation.

I hear people say that we need black representation all the time but for the other groups (like latinos) they are all only mentioned after a tiny bit of representation comes. Like you only hear it in an article about coco or something. Most latinos seen on screen are unbelievably stereotypical, they are either a criminal, gardener, construction worker, poor, or \"hot and spicy\" and they are practically always background characters. Don't get me wrong characters like gloria pritchet are great but also very stereotypical. I can count famous latino characters from american TV on one hand and I can't name 1 famous latino youtuber. We haven't even gotten a Disney princess when practically every other race has!

Latinos made up only 4.5% of speaking roles deposite being 20% of the population and black leads were overrepresented with 14.1% \n    Let me make it clear that I am not hating on black people nor do I think that they shouldn't get the representation they deserve. I know that even though they're over represented there are more problems like not having enough darkskin representation and embodying stereotypes. What I am saying that the push for more latino representation needs to happen and I think it should be more of a priority for people instead of being on the back burner to other groups. \n\nObviously in a perfect world all groups would have all the push for representation.

People tend to overlook the immense environmental destruction which would occur in the aftermath of a nuclear war.  Ash would block out the sun and the lack of light would cause enormous crop failures.  Its estimated that if nuclear war between India and Pakistan occurred, even one with say around 100 nukes, it would trigger a famine that would kill tens of millions of people.  To put things in perspective, The US and Russia both have around 4,000 nukes.  A full out nuclear war between the US and Russia or China would kill billions of people around the globe and almost certainly spell the end of humanity.  \n\nBecause of this, retaliating against a nuclear strike with nuclear weapons is absolutely pointless.  Its impossible to estimate how many nukes a first strike nuclear attack would involve, easily 1,000+ if not more.  This many nuclear explosions would easily cause a global famine with most of humanity either being wiped out or starving to death.  However, theres more hope for the survival of humanity the fewer nukes which are used.  The US retaliating would be the nail in the coffin for humanity, as a full out nuclear exchange would be the end of life on earth.  The US wouldnt even need to retaliate, any country that were to launch a strike would starve to death in the insuring famine, perhaps their infrastructure would be in tact with no people to maintain or use it.  The end result is the same, regardless if the aggressor country is turned into a nuclear wasteland or not, its still suicide and mutually assured destruction.",

The basics of types of comprehension accessible to kids at various ages, and most effective forms of discipline (authoritative parenting, reinforcement, and no physical reprimands) are things everyone should know.\n\n2) The unconscious. Extremely relevant in political conversations. Many of the arguments about racism and sexism in schools, workplaces, and in the police force have a lot to do with this issue, and because people don't understand it or know the research, it causes a greater political divide than there needs to be.\n\n3) Basic social psychology skills: This is important to know how and when people and companies are trying to manipulate you and how your own actions can get out of your control in situations such as groupthink, and how to foil those situations.\n\n4) Understanding what to do If you or someone else is having a mental health crisis.

Or you found out that the NFL draft was a shame for the public and the richest team could just block any draft picks that would be favorable to their rival teams. It would kinda take away from the fairness of the game. \n\nThat's how I see this whole debate over voting rights: Republican politicians have known for years now that the more people vote, the less chance they have of winning elections. In some cases they have literally said this (including Trump who said ' They had things, levels of voting that if youd ever agreed to it, youd never have a Republican elected in this country again'. The way they try to sell this to the public is through absurd claims about voter fraud. After 2016, their OWN election commission found zero evidence of fraud. If you truly believe in democracy, then you should believe that every citizen has the right to vote -- you should be for universal suffrage. Hell in most advanced countries in the world voter registration is automatic. The truth is that it's a party that represents a shrinking minority of people and that absolutely refuses to modernize its party platform to appeal to more voters. So their new strategy is literally trying to make it harder for citizens to vote. If you think less citizens should be able to vote, you don't believe in democracy.",

This means if all the would-be euthanized dogs/cats were instead cooked, this can provide TWELVE MILLION meals. That would be enough meals for 11,000 people for an entire year (3 meals a day). \n\nNow lets think about the number of countries that have shelter animals and all the other animals besides dogs and cats; the amount of food would be enough for MILLIONS for people. \n\nThis is essentially no different to eating a cow.

        "selftext": "First off it is important to note that I(23) am a hearing person and I grew up in the PNW of the USA.\n\nOk, here me out. I think that it is really dumb that schools don't do this already. When I was in 1st and 2nd grade we learned sign language to help with spelling, therefore I have always known the ABC's and very basic signs. When I was younger I remember being able to communicate basic signs to my mom when it was noisy or she was too far away to hear me because she also knew basic ASL.  While I am not fluent in ASL by any means, I feel comfortable enough to interact and sign with a deaf or hard of hearing person. Having that exposure as a kid to ASL as a kid and then being able to use it with my mom was really beneficial to me, and as an adult I wish that I had continued my education in it (I still plan to, I do self study atm). However, as I became a teen/young adult I was shocked to hear experiences from the deaf and hard of hearing community about how they are treated differently. Heck, look on social media and you will be able to find videos of deaf people being unable to order in drive thrus and explanations of other experiences. What really makes me upset though is hearing how teachers will not talk directly to their deaf/HH students but rather just to the interpreters. My friend is an ASL interpreter for the public school system in AZ, and she tells me about how irritating it is for her to see the teacher 1.) ignore her deaf/HH students, 2.) not talk to directly to her students, 3.) not change her behavior after being repeatedly asked/told to, and having my friend explain to the teacher why her actions are problematic.\n\nSo, I think that ASL should be apart of the K-12 curriculum because it would create a more welcoming environment for deaf/HH students, being able to communicate nonverbally is still very useful even for hearing people, it would create more teaching positions that can (and should) be filled by people from the deaf/HH community, and it can assist with learning, especially in early childhood education. \n\nOther than it costing money to hire and provide theses classes from an already pretty slashed public education budget, I don't really see a reason on why it shouldn't be taught. Like what would be the true harm of everyone learning ASL in the USA? It wouldn't take away interpreters jobs since it wouldn't guarantee that the students would be fluent by the time they graduated. Also if we get another Pandemic in the future where everyone has to wear masks again, it would be helpful for hearing people who can't hear through the masks, and for deaf/HH people who aren't able to read lips due to the masks.\n\nAlso, I am aware that there are some deaf/HH people who do not use sign language at all, and I am not trying to make an assumption that all deaf/HH people do use ASL.  \n\nALSO, if you are a deaf/HH person and find this post offensive/ignorant, please know that I am not trying to be and that I do want to understand why.

They can choose to either never be allowed to ban any spam bot or anyone again ever, or they could choose to only allow messages after they've been moderated and checked to make sure nothing is ever said that could hold the owners responsible.\n\nEither of those choices will destroy every forum on the American internet and no one is taking this seriously even though [it was tied to an omnibus bill and had a real chance of passing.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/29/why-trump-is-tying-section-230-to-stimulus-checks-defense-bill.html) \n\nThe talking point from the side that wants to destroy reddit seems to be that since their vulgarian President was banned off twitter for inciting violence their version of 'Free Speech' means their solution to cancel culture in general is to cancel all of our internet culture in the most ironic way possible. The only talking points I've seen skirt around how \"R230\" will destroy reddit by only using lawyer talk and if there is a Republican anywhere who will honestly address this I cannot find them.\n\nTheir talking point is that anytime you are censored on any social media your Freedom of Speech is constitutionally under attack, the talking point from the Left is that this is a private corporation that can ban anyone they want; even Twitter is just a fancy IRC channel it's not irreplaceable by any means.\n\nThe talking point from the party of Citizens United \"corporations are people and unlimited secret campaign donations are Free Speech\" is that corporations now have too much power over our speech.\n\nCan't we all agree that if some /r/Awww user can no longer simply log in to a private corporations website and comment \"that is cute\" because the reddit admins are too scared of being sued that that is objectively a bigger Free Speech issue than their leader being banned for inciting violence?\n\nThat is throwing out the baby with the bath water. That means that for all time internet forums are mostly gone. It's a permanent grossly overarching final solution to a rather mild problem, and I strongly feel like that hypothetical Awww users Freedom to Speak about how they find a pupper cute is way more important than the endless discussion about feelings, and the almost never discussion about policy facts that we get from The Right.\n\nWith that said I just came from a large thread on the front page with thousands of upvotes talking about mod abuses. I agree there is a problem there but destroying every internet forum until the end of time is one of the worst possible solutions that would create a plethora of more problems, endless lawsuits, bigger gov't, and everyone hating each other more. Additionally we wouldn't be able to use our critical thinking brain tank forums to communicate about our point of view on journalism.\n\nI agree we have a censorship problem, but there are also treasure troves of information in the comments.\n\nTL;DR my views to change are 2 fold: am I interpreting the policy correctly, and what possible reason could we have for not banning the people who are threatening to destroy this website the same as we would do for any DDOSer?\n\n&gt;Voltaire: I may not agree with what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\n\nEver since non-uniformed officers made illegal arrests in Portland The Right has come out as saying they do not believe in that quote or ideal whatsoever. I mistakenly believed that was the position of every NRA member but since that issue came up every single Republican famous or otherwise seems to be saying they no longer represent anyone else right to speak freely just their own and R230 perfectly represents this divide.\n\n\"More free speech is always good\" makes sense but if someone is attacking the ability to speak freely on a private corporations property with such mild messages as \"this is cute\" then you no longer have to give them the respect, or the time of day.\n\nImagine you're in a car dealership, and The Right feels their political speech isn't being respected so they pull out a bull horn or an air horn so no one can speak. You don't owe the air horn guy any 'Freedom of Speech' at all and I think that analogy holds up here. R230 is the air horn; it is spam bots everywhere and endless lawsuits.\n\nIt's going to destroy our ability to have this conversation right here and now. Reddit has never been under such an extreme threat, and for some reason I can't wrap my head around why no one is taking it seriously. Do you not believe that Repubs have the power to enact this policy? A simple history lesson should show this is a very probable threat.\n\nCitizens United and Gitmo and the Patriot Act show as much; that the Constitution is only as sacred as political convenience allows.\n\nIf all the social media moguls would band together and threaten to remove anyone who is part of an organization that is threatening to destroy their platform and livelihood then it would probably never have to come to actual bans and that org would probably just fix their policy. At the very least we should be trying to make the voters aware of how ironic their policy is, how else can you possibly view this?\n\nBest case scenario for them is that Twitter moves to Germany and that no one ever uses American forums ever again.",

There are millions of people who are out of work solely because society is not able to be open right now.\n\nWhile I understand the emotional argument, the fact is that mentally handicapped people who live with their parents are among the least likely to provide positive impact to society. \n\nMeanwhile, there are millions of Americans who are not yet eligible for vaccinations whose jobs place them on the front lines, and who have been classified as essential workers. These people are at much greater risk, and are absolutely critical to the normal functioning of our economy. If we want to fully reopen quickly, it seems to me that we should be prioritizing people on the front lines, including restaurant workers and folks in the service industry.\n\nIf that happens to include mentally handicapped people in some cases, then they should be included in the prioritized groups.\n\nBut in my view, simply being mentally handicapped should not place people in a priority group for vaccination.\n\nBy all means, help to change my view on this. I tend to be pretty left wing on most issues, including treatment of the mentally disabled by our society (which I think has really taken a good turn in the last couple decades). And so I honestly find myself feeling pretty sour on this perspective, but I can't escape the fact that it seems like a group that contributes very little to our economy or society as a whole is receiving preferential access to something so critical and hard to come by for people who contribute much more to our society as a whole.\n\n**note:** Please refrain from making an emotional appeal. *Everyone* who gets sick and / or dies is someone's child / parent / grandparent / sibling / loved one.",

Example included: Labeling products using child labor would de-incentivize their purchase at the point of sale and therefore de-incentivize the practice.",
        "selftext": "This view has three main points, and the scenario of labeling products that employ children as \"child-labor products\" is used as an example. The main points are:\n\n1. Disassociation of products and the practices applied in their manufacturing is a leading cause of unethical behavior,\n2. Re-association of products and practices would help eliminate unethical practices by forcing consumers to be acutely aware of what they are funding at the point of sale,\n3. Implementing this practice would have a significant impact in global relations.\n\nHere is an example of this regarding the use of child labor:\n\nIn the developed world, children are protected. These countries recognize that their future resides in their children's abilities to be at least as capable if not better than the previous generation. Every developed country I know of has the same mentality that children should be sheltered and prepared/educated in some form before being thrust into the \"real\" world.\n\nIn undeveloped countries, this isn't necessarily the case. In some of these countries, significant quantities of [children](https://www.unicef.org/csr/child-labour-portal_more.html) will often find themselves [forced to work](https://apnews.com/article/palm-oil-forests-indonesia-scouts-83b01f2789e9489569960da63b2741c4) in order to help their families reach ends meet. These families will pull their children from school at young ages or never send them, solidifying the family's and country's poverty status until eventually they're replaced by automation and then what? A common trait of our current globalization infrastructure is the exploitation of poverty in these countries as a form of lowering COGS to the point that it is now a prerequisite of competitive pricing in developed markets.\n\nI believe the main reason why this exploitation is fruitful is the disassociation of the product from the practice. If the people buying the final product are not acutely aware of this situation or \"moral cost\" at the moment they make the decision to purchase it makes it monumentally easy for them to fund the practice. The inability to hide the moral cost associated with the purchase might drive sales towards other, marginally more expensive products. The intended effect of this would be that companies could choose to be responsible in these matters and simultaneously stay competitive at the point of sale at increased prices due to their products being so labeled. Implementation of this would be overseen by a regulatory agency, likely the FTC.\n\nA possible argument against this is that the overall lifestyle of these undeveloped countries is be better due to the current situation, that even if it's poverty level work it's better than nothing. I just cant seem to actually wrap my head around that idea though.\n\n**Side note:** The view is that this same argument against disassociation of products from the practices applied in their manufacture could be made for a great deal of corporate grey areas that incentivize/propagate behaviors that are frowned upon.",

        "selftext": "College debt cancellation seems to be tossed around in the news a lot. We are hearing numbers from $10K to $50K in debt cancellation thrown around, which are much larger figures compared to the stimulus checks ($4K total) that have been given out in mass during the pandemic in the US . \n\nIn terms of who this will directly benefit, I imagine a strong majority of the beneficiaries will be middle to upper middle income class Americans in their 20s and 30s who have high expected future earnings potential (high human capital). Why target this class of Americans, when a dollar's propensity to be applied towards consumption (and thus to stimulate the economy) goes so much further when given to the lower income classes.  Is this being rationalizes as a new version of trickle down economics that the Left can get behind? The middle income class will now be able to better fund their 401K, (sure that's a good thing) but that won't help spread wealth around today. The poorer classes will not see a cent of the saved and invested funds from this class. If the middle class actually does increase their demand for goods and services, this will drive inflation, likely negating any potential wage increases the lower income classes gain from the demand increase. Plus, I believe history has shown us how wealthier classes are more likely to capture the lion's share of national wealth increases. Just look at the trends in income inequality in the US.\n\nFurthermore, what will the lower income classes get when the middle class is given a 10K-50K gift?  I think about all of the poor who wanted to attend college but did not due to cost, and that pains me. Wow, would it be a slap in the face to have foregone a dream, and now have to fund that dream for someone else through your tax dollars.

        "selftext": "There are many people who are skeptical of the idea that Republicans are not in decline. Didn't they just lose the White House and both sides of Congress? That is true, but they key fact hidden within is the margin of victory. More on that in a bit.\n\nMy position here is that the Republican Party--specifically politicians--can entrench the Republican Party in power at virtually every level of government through voter suppression. Now I'm not saying they will occupy literally every position at every moment, but I am saying that they can maintain and expand their power for an indeterminate but long time. Their means of doing so--at least the ones I want to discuss here--are gerrymandering and voter suppression.\n\n**Gerrymandering**\n\nThis allows politicians to redraw districts and effectively tailor their constituents to their liking, not only helping the individual politician but the political party as a whole maintain power. Both parties do this, and, frankly, I think the Democrats should do so *more* just to play catch-up. But they are not in a position to do so nearly as much as the Republicans.\n\nThe impact of gerrymandering cannot be overstated. Wisconsin is an excellent example of what I mean. In 2018, for example, Democrats received 207K votes but the Republicans gained 27 new seats. Now the Republicans get to redraw the districts to a new gerrymander, precisely because the previous gerrymander entrenched them in enough power to survive. Thus we see the issue: sufficient gerrymandering sustaining a party until the next opportunity to update the gerrymander. Now the presence of a D governor may weaken the gerrymander to a degree, but with a famously partisan WS state supreme court, the gerrymander will remain strong.\n\nThe new gerrymandering forecast as a result of the 2020 elections will continue to give the Republicans a large advantage in the House of Representatives, while the nature and number of Red vs Blue states gives them something resembling a gerrymander in the Senate (though it's not literally a gerrymander). Again, the new gerrymander probably won't be so overwhelming as the previous one, but I liken that to the argument that getting hit by a car going 80mph is better than one going 90mph; you're still dead.\n\nOf course, gerrymandering is not the only arrow in the GOP quiver.\n\n**Voter Suppression**\n\nThe Republicans pass laws to suppress Democrat votes. Flat out. They even admitted this to the SCOTUS recently in the consolidated arguments for Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee and Arizona Republican Party v. Democratic National Committee. And in the wake of the 2020 election they are passing some of the most draconian yet with only the barest attempt at justification. The jewel among these, in my opinion, is AZ's \"state legislature can ignore the vote\" law they're currently debating.\n\nVoter suppression laws have been in effect for a long, long time. While they can be overcome, it is difficult to do so. These new laws, however, are some of the most extreme. Had they been applied in GA in 2020, for example, the state would have voted R, no doubt in my mind.\n\nThere are also laws being worked on in some states that would \"gerrymander\" the electoral college to an extent. Republicans are trying to change Nebraska's EC voting from being split by district to winner-take-all specifically because Omaha voted Dem. Conversely,  New Hampshire Republicans and their newly captured state government are trying to do the inverse and move away from the existing winner-take-all method to help Republicans in a state where Democrats have won the past five presidential elections.\n\n**Margins**\n\nReturning to the margins issue from earlier, the Democratic victory in 2020, while undeniably important, hardly points to Democratic dominance and a dwindling GOP. The actual margin of victory was very, very close, and with the new voter suppression laws coming into effect would have gone the other way.\n\nBiden won the popular vote by a healthy amount. This doesn't matter because the popular vote doesn't put anyone in office, the Electoral College does. But didn't Biden have a healthy win in the EC as well? Looking at the points alone, yep. But to see how close it really was, you have to look at how much Biden won the states that swung to him. Do that and you'll see this election came down to 45,000~ votes. If those votes went the other way, Trump would be president right now. And these voter suppression laws are designed precisely to make sure the votes go the Right way.\n\nThe even more extreme voter suppression rules, combined with the voter suppression already in place, combined with gerrymandering, are, in my view, enough to entrench the Republican Party in power for a long time. Will it gradually weaken over time? Maybe. But it's a long time coming.\n\n*Likely Responses to This and My Pre-Emptive Responses*\n\n\"The GOP is a dying party due to demographics.\" The Republicans are more than capable of legislating ahead of demographics, if indeed the demographics are truly changing at a fast enough rate.\n\n\"But X state is trending/went blue!\" Yeah, and the Republicans are capable of legislating to make sure it doesn't happen [again].\n\n\"The Democrats gerrymander too.\" They don't gerrymander enough in my opinion.\n\n\"But Republican voters...\" Lemme stop you right there and say that the Republican voters have voted for the politicians doing this.\n\n\"Well I'm a Republican and I think gerrymandering/suppression is bad!\" Good for you, you have no influence on this matter anymore. The die is cast.\n\n\"Voter ID would...\" Not prevent this.\n\n\"The election was stolen! This is making sure it can't happen again!\" This is basically an admission that I'm right.\n\n\"The Democrats will use their shiny new trifecta to pass laws to prevent this!\" If they *did* pass H.R. 1 or similar legislation, then, yes, my view would be changed. But it's not likely.\n\n\"Ranked choice...\" isn't being implemented.\n\n\"Just pass popular laws and the Dems'll win.\" [Have some reading.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-dont-fear-an-electoral-backlash-for-opposing-really-popular-parts-of-bidens-agenda/)\n\n\"The arc of history bends towards justice...\" It's a lovely sentiment, but that's all it is.",

It boggles my mind to this day that even though the offer surpasses the demand, its relatively easy these days to gain huge sums of money on Youtube and other platforms. As an 18 year old, lifestyle influencers confuse me the most as I dont think they really have any good impact on society. They dont necessarily educate or create art. Its okay for people to like watching someone just live their life, but I dont agree with making so many of them millionaires. \n\nPeople who work in social services, firefighters, teachers, caregivers and honestly workers of all kinds would often much more benefit from extra funds.

        "selftext": "The word \"anarchism\" has gained some negative connotation, so I would like start by clarifying the term. To some, it evokes images of angry masked folks throwing molotov cocktails.  To others it simply means \"everyone can do whatever they want.\"  Neither are particularly accurate. \n\nAnarchism is actually the name given to the principle under which a group of people may organize without top down rule.  It is essentially self governance. It is being against one group or person having \"power over\" others.  Anarchism begins with naming and resisting those things that oppress, rejecting social hierarchies that place one group of people over another.  Anarchism rejects the logic that places some over other on the basis of race, ethnic or cultural background, legal status, social status, class, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, or any other rationale used for one group to exercise domination over another.  It means challenging economic systems which encourage social inequalities based upon private property and wage labor and instead envisions a society that emphasizes cooperation, mutual aid, holding land in common, and workers sharing ownership of the means of production.  It means committing ourselves to undoing the legacies of oppression that have been passed down to us as we seek to build communities of hospitality, compassion, and inclusion.\n\nAnarchism and\nJesus' life and teachings show a way of non-dominationa way of liberation and love that pushes back against systems of death.  Jesus' emphasis on love, inclusion, and radical engagement with systems of oppression in his day can help us love our neighbors as we challenge the systems of oppression in our day.\n\nBelow are a collection of quotes better able to elucidate this idea than I might be able too:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/Christian_anarchism",

Basically, some people used the term super straight to describe someone who is attracted to people of the opposite sex only (aka not including trans people as a way of making fun of them). While it was clear that the people who say super straight are using it to demean trans people, the person that I was debating with made the claim that if a straight person is not attracted to trans people of the opposite gender, then they are bigoted and wrong. I strongly disagree with this point. They werent very good at debating, however, and just resorted to name calling, so I wasnt really able to get much of a conversation out of them. As such, I would like to have a rational discussion with you guys about this topic. *I would like to clarify that I am 100% for trans rights, and think that they should be accepted in society*, but I do not think that it is wrong to not be attracted to them. I believe that people are allowed to like who they like, and that not being attracted to someone is not a reason to call someone bigoted. Unfortunately, my views got heavily downvoted. Its clear that a large portion of Reddit disagrees with me. So please, change my view. Why is it wrong to not be attracted to transgenders?",

        "selftext": "What I mean by this is that we should take care of all the rescue and shelter dogs currently in existence, and spay and neuter them to make sure that they don't reproduce anymore. It's cruel that we've domesticated them for our own enjoyment (and/or to use them as slaves for those that become \"working dogs\"), which means that we have an obligation to take care of those that are still in existence (since they wouldn't survive in the wild), but cease to breed them for our own enjoyment. Same goes for any other \"pet\" animal or \"food\" animal. Animals aren't here to be used for our enjoyment, they deserve to be able to live natural lives in the wild.  I don't understand how people justify breeding dogs to work as slaves in police work or for the military, when the dogs are unable to consent to putting their lives on the line.  \n\nAgain, I do believe that rescue and shelter dogs need homes, and we have a moral obligation to take them in (if we are able to), and let them live out the rest of their lives comfortably.  As for the farm animals bred for food?  We should also take care of those already in existence, and not horrifically slaughter them for meat.  Ideally, they should be taken to sanctuaries and be allowed again, to live out the rest of their lives, and spayed and neutered prevent any further breeding.  \n\nAnd going back to the dog example, even if you don't believe that we should completely stop breeding, why would you choose to buy a newborn puppy when there are millions of dogs rotting away in shelters as we speak?  Not to mention that many breeds like pugs and show German Shepards (not working) have been bred to the point that the dogs are extremely unhealthy.  Also, why is it so important for some to have a specific breed?  Vanity?  Why is an conventionally unattractive shelter mutt less worthy of love than a purebred Pomeranian?  Why are people buying from breeders SO obsessed with breed, when any shelter mutt is equally capable of loving you and are just as sweet.  Yes, some of them may have some emotional issues, but it USUALLY isn't anything a dedicated owner can't deal with.  I have a beagle/terrier/italian greyhound mix from a rescue, and though he was a bit shy and had severe anxiety when we got him, a few months later, after some training and love, he's a social, happy dog with little to no anxiety.  I know several other people who have adopted rescue dogs that had little to no issues, and some with more severe issues, but through hard work and dedication (which you should be willing to do when you adopt a good boi or girl), they've established beautiful bonds with their pups.  Why, why, why would you CHOOSE to buy from a breeder, when there are so many lovable pups available for adoption at your local shelter?  And if your argument is \"I don't want an older dog, I want a puppy\", then remember that many a time, entire litters of puppies are abandoned and can be found at shelters.  There's really no excuse for buying from breeders in my opinion.  Feel free to dispute my claims and change my mind.",

        "selftext": "There are a lot of things wrong in different areas that I am going to address here.\n\n**1. Infants and babies**- When children under the age of 1 are taken away and live with their foster parents especially those taken at birth and raised for a few years to the point where they don't remember their biological parents and see their foster parents as their parents, the foster parents should be given the option to adopt before the child who has no memory of their biological parents are sent back, assuming the biological parents have done what they need to do to regain rights. The Trauma is not worth it.\n\n**2. Older children**- Children who are old enough to remember their biological parents, should be given the choice whether to reunify with their parents or stay with their foster parents. Just because they are legally able to take back their children does not mean they should and does not mean the children feel safe or secure going back to their bio parents. If older children (upper primary school and up) feel safer and more secure with the foster parents there is probably something wrong with the home they were taken from.\n\n**3. Stop needlessly moving children from house to house if neither the foster parents or children have an issue** I can not for the life of me understand why the system does this. The only thing it teaches the children is never to make bonds or friends because they will be broken and end up hurt. If the foster child wants to be rehomed and their is another place for them to go I get it. If the foster parents for some reason say its not working out, its shitty but I get it. But for both sides to be happy and the state say, yeah sorry times up you need to go to the next home is ridiculous.\n\n**4. Other than religion and culture all parental rights and should be transferred to the foster parents for the duration of the children stay** The Bio parents should get 0 say what activities their children can partake in or whether they can go on vacation or whether they are allowed to be vaccinated. It is ridiculous that people who were such awful parents that they needed to have the state intervene get veto's over stuff. Keep the children connected to their culture and religion and that's it.\n\n**5. Lastly housing situation.** I don't get why the foster parents can't sleep on the couch to meet the bed requirements, there is a lack of suitable foster parents as is, if someone is willing give up their room to meet the requirement there is no reason to stop them. To me it shows they are much more likely to actually care about the child rather then look for a payday if they are giving up comfort and convenience to help an unfortunate child.",

        "selftext": "Having watched the whole interview, I feel no more informed about this situation than I did before. Its really annoyed me seeing people on both the pro-Meghan and anti-Meghan sides act with such certainty about what has happened when in reality the interview was so poor we still have no idea. Oprah never once questioned what Meghan was saying and just treated her like a friend, which would be fine if they were just there for a chat, but when she is making serious accusations that will do enormous damage to the UKs reputation, she should be put under scrutiny and questioned to see if her story holds up.\n\nThe best example I have is the claim (or implication) that Archie wasnt going to get a Prince title because of his race. This is a complete lie and frankly disgusting, none of the Queens great grandchildren have titles apart from Williams who are in line to the throne. The fact that Oprah didnt question this means she is either aware and wants to mislead us, or she is unaware and hasnt done enough research. Either is bad journalism. The fact that Meghan has said it means that she either knows and is lying, or she doesnt know and is paranoid and stupid for not finding out the real reason before the interview. This for me is enough proof that neither of them are reliable sources and the rest of the interview should be cast into doubt. Im not saying she has made up the rest of the stuff, thats not anything I can comment on, but we cannot take her side of the story as truth nor can we say its false.\n\nAnother part that made no sense to me was that Archie wasnt going to receive security. I do not understand how this would work when Harry and Meghan were receiving security at that point. How do you protect 2 parents but not the child with them? Again no follow up from Oprah. I also just cant believe that the Queens great grandson would be left without protection, that seems either made up or exaggerated to me. I havent actually seen any discussion about this point so maybe Im being dumb and missing something here.\n\nFinally the biggest accusation, that someone in the family was concerned about Archies skin colour. By not naming the person they have tarred all the family members with the same brush, which is completely unfair as only one of them made the comments. Again this could be deliberate in order to inflict maximum damage. The fact that Oprah didnt press for a name, and then had to say after the interview that it wasnt the Queen or Phillip is again proof she did a bad job in the interview. Presumably then it was Charles or William, and in that case we deserve to know if we are going to have a racist King in the future if the claim is true. Part of me also wonders if it wasnt Will or Charles and the reason they kept the name quiet is because it is one of the unimportant royals. Harry and Meghan also seemed to be telling different stories about it which also makes me cast doubt.\n\nIn summary, I think people shouldnt take anything away from that interview and Oprah did a bad job, we will likely never know as Meghan and Harry have said thats their last word on it.",

        "selftext": "I've never understood the point of writing a baby's sex on their birth certificate. Essentially, you're just telling the government what genitals your child has, which is really weird if you think about it. It's just invasive and sexualising, and I really don't see why the government (or anyone) would need to know.\n\nGenerally, I can't really think of any situations where it would be necessary for authorities to know a person's sex or gender. Everyone (ideally) should be treated the exact same under the law, so there shouldn't be any need to know what their gender is. It kind of feels like gender markers on legal documents are just something left over from the time where women weren't allowed to vote and had less rights - in those times, the government definitely needed to monitor who had rights and who didn't. But this has no place in our modern society.\n\nAlso, a person's birth sex doesn't really dictate anything about them - they can still act or dress or identify in any number of ways. Getting rid of gender markers on birth certificates would make it a lot easier for transgender / non-binary people, as it would not only eliminate the tedious process of getting them changed, but also eliminate the pain of being inaccurately labelled on your legal documents for the time before you can change them.\n\nAdditionally, getting rid of gender markers on birth certificates would eliminate the pressure for doctors to \"choose a sex\" in intersex children. Around 1 or 2 in a thousand kids are born with genitals that don't seem to be typically male or female, which isn't an insanely high number, but still adds up to quite a lot of people. In those cases, it's customary for doctors to test for chromosomes, gonads, internal organs etc., and decide which sex the baby is \"closer\" to. Then, they'll probably perform surgery on the baby's genitals to \"normalise\" them. These surgeries are (in most cases) purely cosmetic, and have no medical necessity; and they usually cause more harm that good (for example, pain, scarring and inability to orgasm later in life). It's quite literally genital mutilation, and it's considered a normal medical practice almost everywhere. Eliminating the pressure on doctors to decide on a sex at birth would also lower the \"need\" for these kinds of surgeries.\n\nIn conclusion, I can only think of pros to eliminate gender markers on birth certificates, and I can't really think of any cons. But there are most probably things that I failed to consider. So please, CMV!",

He was talking about how 'weaker' people are destined to fail and that they shouldn't hold us back from having a more capitalist society where there is less government control and less government funding for public institutions. He avidly supports tax cuts for the rich and believes that anybody can succeed if they work hard enough. He doesn't believe in welfare or pretty much any sort of government responsibility for it's people. According to him, to succeed, you have to be a \"wolf\", and people who don't succeed lack the drive it takes to do so. \n\nFine, but this is where his hypocrisy really begins to set in. He's constantly criticizing mostly poorer people for resorting to crime to make a living and refers to these people as weak, but when large corporations use illegal means to meet their ends he says it's what's bound to happen in a free market. \nI feel comfortable in saying that it's unfair for him to hold these people to a different standard then any other corporation where capital is the priority. In my opinion, if you truly believe in unregulated capitalism, then you have no right to critize drug lords like El Chapo for seizing the opportunity to make billions off the drug trade. He's in my opinion, the epitome of what it means to be a TRUE capitalist, where the value of capital exceeds the value of human lives. Oil companies are constantly hiring militias to murder people who reside in towns where oil is abundant. Many companies profit off of child labor, poverty, and political instability the same way cartels do. CMV...",

        "selftext": "Header - If you are unaware what the Super+ community and what it stands for, head over to r/Superstraight and form your own views, whether good or bad.\n\nSo yeah, I'm seeing a lot of stories about the \"Transphobic\" super sexual \"Trend\" that's arisen recently. The definition as I see it is as follows: \n\n\"As cisgender man/woman who is attracted to cisgender men/women of the opposite sex\"\n\nPersonally, I saw that, and figured, yeah, that's pretty simple, and honestly, something that seems a reasonable identity solution to trans men/women being offended when someone of the opposite gender is not attracted to them based on the fact that they have transitioned and were not born as the gender they currently are, and honestly seemed to be easier to understand than most of the \"Valid and accepted\" sexualities out there.\n\nI want to make a point here that I don't feel has been made yet, there is uproar over this, because it is named Transphobic. Yet there is a sexuality named \"Skoliosexual\" which is the specific attraction to 'Non-cisgender identities', meaning people on the trans spectrum. If this is accepted as a valid and acceptable sexuality, why isn't the S+ Community, people who are attracted to specifically cisgender people of a certain sex?\n\n I feel like people are hearing these words, not using their critical thinking, and judging a community based on the actions of a few members, and jumping to a conclusion that doesn't fit with the reality of the community.\n\nPeople who have came out as Super Straight/Bi/Gay ect, have received some pretty brutal hate, insult and even death threats, is this what modern debate on identity has come to? Is this inclusivity and acceptance? \n\nThe arguement from the trans community is as follows; \n\n\"Not being sexually attracted to someone of the gender you are attracted to, because of the fact that they have underwent a transition from a sexuality you are *not* attracted to, is transphobic\"\n\nThis is promoting rape culture, plain and simple. A straight woman, would be forced to have sex with a Trans man to prove that they're not transphobic? That's fucking disgusting, and anyone who makes these arguements should take a serious look at themselves,\n\nThis isn't a hate message to the trans community, or even a screaming endorsement of the S+ community, this is a request for reflection on your views, there are members of the S+ community that perpetuate anti-trans hate and bring disrepute onto the entire community, and members of the trans community fail to understand the views of most of the S+ community, instead vowing to kill, hate and abuse those who identify as such, \n\nHow is this different from any minority sexuality in the past who have been invalidated and abused based on who they are sexually attracted to? What happened to your own sexual attraction being accepted? \n\nIf there are serious concerns from the trans community that I'm missing, then please, comment below or feel free to message me privately (hate excluded), I'm not willing to exclude the trans community from this conversation, everyone shouting hate from a distance isn't helping shit, and will only further divide communities, this also applies to those in the S+ community who perpetuate abuse against the trans community, that is not what we represent.  \n\nIn conclusion to what I've said here, I think the Super Straight/Bi/Gay+ community is perfectly valid and worthy of acceptance, and I've covered my points as to why this is, before commenting hate, at least read the full post. Thanks for reading and giving me your time, whoever you are, I appreciate you. \n\nI'll endeavour to reply to anyone who disagrees with me, and even open to having my viewpoint changed should new evidence present itself, I do get busy in the week so please bear with me if you don't get an instant reply.",

        "selftext": " The way EV's are being built currently, swapping the batteries is at worst impossible, at best not economically feasible.  This essentially means that the hot new EV's today, will be virtually worthless once the battery goes.  How long does a battery last?  Best estimates say 8 years.  Well, the average term of ownership is 6 years, so what's the problem?  The average internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, has a lifespan of 11-12 years.  That means that, currently new ICE vehicles are good for 2 ownership cycles.  Person buys a new car, trades it in after 6 years, second person buys 6 year old car, get's 5-6 additional years out of it.  The used car market accounts for 70% of vehicle sales in the US.  In the case of EV's a 6 year old car is nearing the end of their life cycle.  That would mean that those cars are not going to be desirable/available in the used market.  Thus, in a 100% new EV market, 70% of current car buyers would not be willing/able to buy a car.  So now you say: Okay, maybe those people just take public transit or UBER.  Sure.  But there is 2 sides to a used car sale. If your 6 year old car is nearing the end of it's useable life, and nobody is going to be willing/able to buy it, what does that do to your resale value?  If EV's are going to only be worth their weight in scrap value in 6-8 years, who's going to pay a premium to get one new?    For EV's to be economically sustainable long term, they need to be worth something after the first term of ownership.  In order for that to happen, you'd either need to seriously extend the lifespan of the batteries or make swapping batteries easy and cost effective.  If the auto makers don't address the battery lifespan problem then my prediction is that the EV market is going to tank in 6-8 years and no amount of government incentive is going to bring it back.  Battery swap technology would make battery lifespan theoretically infinite.  If battery lifespan was infinite, that would make used EV's extremely reliable long term vehicles (easily 4 times more reliable than the ICE equivalent) and thus extremely valuable in the used market. Desirable cars in the used market dictates resale value and as a consequence dictates new car purchase decisions.    Current automakers can drag their feet on battery swap tech if they want but in 6-8 years the market is going to force their hand anyway.  Battery swap tech is already being used in China and it's use by American automakers is inevitable.  The whole EV thing is just not going to be sustainable longer term otherwise.  Change my view.",

Any normal 12 year old knows that rape and murder is wrong. No normal 12 year old kidnaps a 6 year old, rapes them, kills them, and then dumps the remains in a ditch. That is not the type of crime that an INNOCENT CHILD thinks of. Those are perverse thoughts that come from an ADULT mind. If you do an adult crime you should do adult time in jail.\n\nIn addition by making the excuse \"oh, he just didn't know what he was doing was bad\" you are also giving the benefit of the doubt to people like Ethan Couch, a rich boy that \"suffers\" from \"afflueza.\" For those of you that don't know this guy was driving recklessly and drunk one day and ended up killing 4 people. His lawyer argued that rich kids like him have \"affluenza\" which means that he was so rich an spoiled that he didn't know that what he was doing was wrong because his parents never disciplined him. Therefore, he should be excused because he shouldn't face consequences for something he didn't know was wrong. Excuse me but your lack of self awareness is no one else's fault or problem which leads me to my other point.\n\nI have seen many cases where a family is completely destroyed because their child was viciously raped or murdered. Their lives will never be the same. But because the kid who did the crime is 12 they get away with a slap on the wrist and get to live the rest of their lives freely because they got out of juvie for \"good behavior.\" HOW IS THAT JUSTICE??? The result is exactly the same for the victim, they are 6 feet underground and will never get to grow up. So tell me why everything is forgiven because the perpetrator is a kid?",

This is a sort of off-shoot of the dozens of \"not dating a trans person is transphobic\" threads we've been seeing on the sub lately. Please forgive me if I have some trouble properly expressing this viewpoint in an understandable way, like i said it's new and I'm not totally sure about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, In the various trans threads, a common issue seems to pop up: A cis het person understands themselves to not be transphobic, yet they won't date a trans person (even one who is practically indistinguishable from their preferred birth-sex). The case is then made that if that person refuses to date a trans person on grounds that are not incidental (such as wanting to have children, liking the feel of natural genitals, etc), but rather strictly because they are trans, then they are transphobic. There then proceeds to be a back and forth between the commenters arguing either position. The cis het person might argue that, because sex and dating is exclusionary, they are not obligated to be attracted to a trans person, and the reason why doesnt matter. The opposing view might argue that, by not being inclusive of dating a trans person (who, by all accounts is indistinguishable from a cis het person), they are being transphobic by not actually viewing that person as the sex that they identify as, and as such, they are being immoral and harming the trans community. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe that sex and a relationship between two consenting adults has absolutely no obligation to abide by any societal mores. Basically, it's nobody's business to judge someone for who they decide to have sex or not have sex with. To go further, let's say a white person and a black person were in a relationship with each other. Neither of them are racist, but because of the weird way that kinks and fetishes work, let's say they are both into race-play. This attitude is strictly kept between these two individuals and only during sex (i.e the actions they employ during their \"kinkier\" sessions absolutely do not represent their actual views on race). Similarly, it's not OK to call women sluts in society, but if two consenting adults liked to do that during sex, then neither any individuals nor society at large is harmed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo bring this back to the trans dating issue, I believe that if a cis het person doesn't want to date a trans person, then their reasoning DOESN'T MATTER, so long as they still respect and accept trans people. Sexuality is weird, and it's unfair to levy criticisms and judgements into the relationship of two consenting adults who may express sexual sentiments that are contrary to what they believe in the context of society.",

        "selftext": "Right Libertarianism is the political ideology that is aimed at maximizing personal liberty and minimizing government interference. Let me list off a few of the positions that Right Libertarianism holds...\n\n1.) Anti-Crony Capitalism.\n\nRight Libertarians believe in Capitalism, but oppose money being brought into politics; for example, right now, a company like Apple donates to the Biden or the Trump campaign, and when Biden or Trump go to the round table to make decisions? That donation is sitting in the back of their minds. Maybe they are politically pressured into raising taxes for the rich, and maybe they opt to raise taxes by 10% instead of 12%. Something like that. We believe that politicians should not be swayed by outside funding to make decisions. Take money OUT of politics.\n\n2.) No More Prison Industrial Complex\n\nRight Libertarians believe in drug use and dealing, for at the very least Weed. Obviously, drug dealing sounds bad but only because its outlawed and it happens on a black market. Getting people out of prison for drug offenses like weed possession and dealing will greatly decrease the prison population. Additionally, we do not believe in prisoners being used for labor, especially if they are not payed minimum wage at the very least. No more using laws as an excuse to force labor out of people.\n\n3.) No more taxes\n\nTaxation is theft. Think about all of the taxes that you pay year-round, and ask yourself where you would be right now if you hadnt payed a dime in taxes in the past 5 years. How much more money would you have? Would you have been in a position to make a decision to invest in something, or start up your own business? Thats a lot of money that would be in your pocket that could be paying off right now in the midst of this pandemic. Instead, you pay thousands of dollars every year in taxes, and when you need assistance from the government? They dont have any money saved up. They need to print money and put our grandchildren in debt. On top of that, theyre giving you bread crumbs. $1400 every 4 months, thats $4200 per years and thats being generous. Meanwhile, you pay twice that in taxes every year. What? And to add on, theyre dropping bombs in Syria and whatnot. Right Libertarianism doesnt believe we should be spending billions every year on our military industrial complex. Your taxes are going toward an endless war right now while some of your fellow citizens are struggling to pay rent.\n\nThis is getting pretty long do I will just run through some other issues.\n\n4.) Free market capitalism can be the solution to climate change!\n\n5.) Taxes shouldnt go to abortions, which is something righties would support, and private businesses should be able to offer abortions if theyre want. Middle ground! Win-Win!\n\n6.) Right to free speech and to bear arms!\n\n7.) Right to privacy! No more government spying! No more overreach!\n\n8.) Right to information! You should have a right to scrub your information from the internet! You should have the right to own your identity!\n\nAnyway, Ill leave that there. Change my view!",

Well, I came to the realization that this is pretty much what spaghetti, and effectively most pasta is. Noodles are essentially just bread stretched and coiled out into long ropes, the difference between them and say a slice of bread being the same as a baguette vs a croissant. A sandwich doesn't need any specific thing between the bread, but it's usually a meat/vegetable/grain base, which spaghetti has. Tomato sauce (pretty much ketchup, mayo, mustard, whatever) and meatballs are the \"filling\" needed to make it a sandwich. That said, I see no difference between a McDouble, and 5$ footlong, and some Olive Garden pasta. \n\nThanks for listening to my TEDx Talk",

But apart from that, we've seen brokers have other issues that have caused traders financial harm, including for example routine errors or shutdowns of their trading platforms. My personal view is that Congress should make it illegal for a broker to operate unless it accepts full liability for such losses and for missed gains that result from broker shutdowns, maintenance issues, or the like.",

The average hourly wage in Mississippi is actually below $15. The main potential consequences of this action is inflation in prices and increased unemployment rate. Currently, I'm doing a part-time job at a Kroger while I'm still in high school. A minimum wage increase could harm early job opportunities for high school and college age students.

Its laughable.\n\n58 is 34th percentile.\n\n\nPeople dont realize that the nationwide average is worthless and the only thing that matters is the height of the people around you.\n\nThe 59 average includes men of all ages. Am I competing against 65 year old boomers? No. So filter the nationwide height to include gen z only and 58 is already starting to look comically short. Now imagine you live in a majority white state. Then, on top of that, the white population in your state has heavy Scandinavian ancestry.  So you took caucasians, the tallest race, and made them even taller. If that wasnt enough, go to college, where the men are even taller than that.\n\nHow can you convince yourself that a 58 man, surrounded solely by privileged men of nordic descent, bordering on 6, barefoot, ON AVERAGE, is not short? Arguing against manlet status at that point goes from somewhat debatable to full on delusional.\n\nBeing 58 would make you shorter than 66% of ALL MEN in the U.S. before applying any of these filters.

Patagonia has similar prices to Nike, yet they can charge these prices due to their extreme environmental efforts, as well as a decent warranty policy. I would also consider their quality of product much higher than their Nike counterparts. They will repair your products under their warranty and encourage the continued use of old gear. On the other hand we have brands like Arcteryx. Their warranty is one of the best out there and their technology focussed approach is on the leading edge. I would not dare to compare the quality of Arcteryx clothing to Nike's counterparts. Lets even take designer brands like Gucci into account.

        "selftext": "It is absurd to think that not liking a food is being racist or something. Really, some people just dont like it, and the internet has no law banning people not liking certain foods. The internet is a diverse place and you can not like certain stuff. \n\nIm talking about the pretty recent Fufu Challenge. I know people think stuff such as africans are historically marginalized and targets so they dont deserve this. Yeah i get it, there can be some undertones of being racist when you dont like african food because of the history of africans being oppressed. but in the end, Fufu is just food made of cassava and other starch plants dipped in egusi soup or some other soup. It is not a god nor is it someone elses mother.\n\nNo one hates the whole of west africa (or africa itself) just by not liking one food. No one hates culture just by not liking one food. No one hates their people just by not liking one food.\n\nOkay i talked about the not liking food part. I know these foods are subjects in food trends and internet challenges and Im gonna talk about these.\n\nThe challenges mainly get people to try food they wouldnt normally eat. Gets them out of their comfort zone. They may have different tastes and not liking certain flavors they are foreign to, but i see beauty in this. Humans live on a globe, and we all have differences but we never isolate ourselves because of differences. We try to understand others.\n\nI dont think these challenges have so much of a malicious intent, as many tiktokers and people on the internet do end up liking fufu or smelly tofu etc after trying it with the mindset of doing a challenge. Im from Hong Kong, and one famous street food here is braised cows innards. Seeing people not liking these foods and seeing people liking them, it reminds me that the world is wide, and we live in a world of different people.\n\nBUT. When people act purposefully like these foods that they havent eaten before are devils food, faeces, or just plain extremely bad, I think that is really stupid. With race in mind, that can be racist.\n\nBut if you just dont like it and you want to share it, it wouldnt be racist. Respect doesnt mean you have to like everything. \n\nCMV pls. \n\nOne exception for me is Lutefisk and things like that. I think not liking it, or having an aversion of it, is more than reasonable - there are harmful chemical contents in it!",

        "title": "CMV: All DUI laws in the U.S. are unnecessary and should be abolished",
        "selftext": "Basically, the title. I believe that all DUI laws are unnecessary and should therefore be abolished in favor of enforcing current reckless driving statutes. In order to lay out my argument, I'll describe the basic types of DUI laws and explain why each particular version is flawed. \n\nThe first type of DUI law (and the most common and widely-known) deals with motorists with Blood Alcohol Concentrations (BACs) above 0.08%. Extensive [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29863383/) has shown that blood-alcohol concentrations affect individuals with great variability. For example, individuals with a higher alcohol tolerance (which is widely variable based on genetics, sex, drinking habits, etc.) may be comparatively unaffected by a BA of 0.09%, whereas other individuals may be more impaired with a BAC of 0.05% than the individual unaffected by an unlawful BAC, despite the latter person posing a greater risk to other drivers. \n\nThe second type of DUI law regards individuals who are impaired to the slightest degree. In these laws, a motorist is guilty of DUI if they are impaired to the slightest degree by alcohol or any other drug. It doesn't take much imagination to envision a hypothetical scenario where the necessity of this type of law is called into question. If Driver A is the safest driver in a particular jurisdiction, and they consume enough alcohol to  impair them to the degree where they now become the second safest driver in the jurisdiction, Driver A is technically guilty of DUI despite the fact that they are safer than every other individual in the jurisdiction except for one. If the purpose of DUI laws are to ensure public safety, what is the point of convicting and punishing an individual who poses almost no risk? \n\nThe third type of DUI law deals with illicit substances. In many states, these statutes are written similarly to the aforementioned BAC statutes, in that there is no legal requirement for the driver to be impaired in order for them to be found guilty of a crime. The rationale, therefore, is the same: if a driver does not pose a substantial public safety concern, then why should they be subjected to laws that simply don't apply to them? Ultimately, the purpose of DUI laws are to ensure public safety, but in these cases they do nothing to promote such a cause. Instead, they serve to punish drivers who are not necessarily more dangerous than any other driver on the road. \n\nFurthermore, reckless driving statutes do far more to ensure public safety than do DUI laws. By enforcing already-codified reckless driving laws, all legitimate DUI arrests (in which the individual arrested poses a legitimate danger to themselves or others as a result of their impairment) would still occur whereas all unnecessary arrests (in which individuals are arrested not for being unsafe, but for violating a law that is fundamentally unnecessary) would not. \n\nThe American judicial system is built on the idea that it is better for 100 guilty individuals to go free than 1 innocent person be convicted. Abolishing all DUI laws would do exactly that--individuals who drive under the influence and who pose safety threats would be apprehended and convicted of reckless driving and the system wouldn't be unnecessarily burdened by individuals who pose no threat, thereby allowing the system to work more effectively and efficiently.",

        "title": "CMV: Traditional Family is Patriarchal, but it is Still Ideal and Good",
        "selftext": "This is my first post here.\n\nFirst of all, I guess I'm a traditionalist Christian who is open-minded about politics unless it contradicts undermines Christian tradition (New Testament, not the Old Testament laws for Israel). I've been looking into leftism (this is revisited later in the post but you can ignore it if you don't care), but I'm really off-put by the Marxist attacks against family that many people make. I'm a teenager though, so all of this might just change in a year or two. I would also like to clarify that I don't think that traditional family is good because it is \"natural,\" but because it is both ordained by God and has tangible benefits to society (you can ignore the former if you want), with all of the alternatives being worse.\n\nAnyways, I would define \"traditional family\" as a family:\n\n\\-With children being primarily raised by two parents in a stable relationship (this doesn't exclude LGBT parents or households with some members of the extended family such as grandparents)\n\n\\- in the same home\n\n\\-where the mother is a stay-at-home mom for the entirety of the time when their children are 18 or under (so the mother can work before or after having children, because why not?)\n\nI would like to clarify that I do NOT think that traditional family is good because it is \"natural.\" I think that traditional family is good because it is both ordained by God and has tangible benefits to society (which I will explain later).\n\nThe common argument against this seems to be that this is patriarchal. I get why this isn't the most liberating for women, but that problem seems to be absolutely insignificant compared to the benefits of a child having two parents, with the mother being a stay-at-home mom. On top of all of the following benefits simply being intuitive, studies support the idea of this being ideal. Children are more drawn to their mothers, so it makes sense for mothers to be the ones primarily raising their children. On top of that, women are shown to generally have traits making them even more preferable to be the one raising the children than fathers. It is also ideal for mothers to be stay-at-home moms rather than working moms because science shows that children raised by stay-at-home moms end up more successful, healthy etc. than children raised by working moms. All of this goes to show that the traditional family is ideal.\n\nHowever, I don't judge working moms in today's society. It seems like capitalism, or at least our current version of capitalism makes it impractical for many mothers to stay at home rather than work in a job. However, leftism seems to be a good solution to this.\n\n\\[This is how I would want my opinion to affect the world!\\] Also, I don't think that people who happen to live better with a family structure contradictory to traditional marriage should be shamed. They exist, but are still just exceptions. Even if they are NOT living better and are making a bad choice, then perhaps it would be OK to shame them (there are limits to that, obviously) but it would definitely not be OK to punish them or force them to choose differently, unless the children's wellbeing is in grave threat, which it seems like we already do. Additionally, I guess it would also be good for organizations to promote this traditional family along with the actual arguments for it to give this propaganda a rational aspect.\n\nI'll get links for sources if you guys insist. I don't want to spend any more time on this than I already have, I gotta do stuff.",

I respect the fact that black people have been oppressed for centuries, but what about Japanese occupation of the China, Korea, and the Philippines? What about British occupation of South Asia? Whereas slavery was abolished in the 19th century in the US, slavery was still present in Asian countries until the mid 20th century.\n\nEven on US soil, what about Japanese Americans being put in concentration camps without charge? What about the continental railroad where Chinese people often got detonated to death when clearing the Sierras? What about the Bellingham riots when Indians and Sikhs were beat up by mobs, jailed, and then excluded from the workforce?\n\nAsians arent looking for sympathy, were just looking for to be treated equally instead of getting dinged to appease people who want to help black people. This has made liberals think Asians are people who are all successful and never face discrimination, when Asians are disproportionately getting targeted by black people. \n\nWhile democrats passed a bill recognizing the rise in Asian hate crimes, they pin it on the pandemic and white supremacy. If you visit NYC and Oakland, you see a history of young black men beating up elderly Asians that extends beyond the pandemic.\n\nTo liberals who claim their fight for racial equality, I believe many of you guys are part of the issue. You fight for minorities that the news portrays as trendy to fight for. Yet you dont care about the fact that many Asians groups like Bangladeshis, Cambodians, and Laotians have a high rate of poverty. You dont care about the fact Indians and East Asians are routinely punished for their academic success because they CHOOSE to study hard.

        "selftext": "People often cite Malcolm X quotes when arguing their particular stance on race in America. I take no issue with this if done responsibly.\n\nWhen I say people misquote Malcolm X, I do not mean that the conclusion they reach is necessarily misinformed or that Malcolm X himself would not agree with that conclusion. I only mean that their arguments misrepresent the intent behind the specific quote being cited. \n\nPerhaps misquote isnt the right word. Quote out of context to such a degree that completely distorts intended meaning is more accurate. \n\nThe [specific 1963 speech ](https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=3&amp;psid=3619) Im referring to is quite long, but here is the passages I see most often quoted:\n\n*The white liberal differs from the white conservative only in one way: the liberal is more deceitful than the conservative. The liberal is more hypocritical than the conservative. Both want power, but the white liberal is the one who has perfected the art of posing as the Negro's friend and benefactor; and by winning the friendship, allegiance, and support of the Negro, the white liberal is able to use the Negro as a pawn or tool in this political \"football game\" that is constantly raging between the white  liberals and white conservatives.*\n\n*The white conservatives aren't friends of the Negro either, but they at least don't try to hide it. They are like wolves; they show their teeth in a snarl that keeps the Negro always aware of where he stands with them. But the white liberals are foxes, who also show their teeth to the Negro but pretend that they are smiling. The white liberals are more dangerous than the conservatives; they lure the Negro, and as the Negro runs from the growling wolf, he flees into the open jaws of the \"smiling\" fox.*\n\nLeftists and conservatives love to cite these quotes. They do it for different reasons, of course, but both take aim at the beliefs of individual white liberals, deeming them disingenuous, selfish, and unbothered by the oppression of Black Americans.\n\nI take serious issue with this framing because I believe the white liberals that Malcolm X is specifically referencing are politicians, not their constituents. My evidence is, what I believe to be, pretty obvious context clues directly preceding and following the oft-repeated lines:\n\n- The American government is trying to trick her twenty-two million ex-slaves with promises that she never intends to keep.\n\n- The greedy politicians who run this government give lip-service to the civil rights struggle only to further their own selfish interests. And their main interest as politicians is to stay in power.\n\n- the Negroes . . . are nothing but tools, used . . . either to get into power or to remain in power.\n\n- In this profitable game of deceiving and exploiting the political politician of the American Negro, those white liberals have the willing cooperation of the Negro civil rights leaders.\n\n- this small (three million) minority of Negro voters hold the decisive edge in determining who will be the next President . . . it is easy to understand why the presidential candidates of both political parties put on such a false show with the Civil Rights Bill and with false promises of integration.\n\n- The white liberals hate The Honorable Elijah Muhammad because they know their present position in the power structure stems form their ability to deceive and to exploit the Negro, politically as well as economically.\n\n- Let us examine briefly some of the tricky strategy used by white liberals to harness and exploit the political energies of the Negro. The crooked politicians in Washington, D.C., purposely make a big noise over the proposed civil rights legislation. By blowing up the civil rights issue they skillfully add false importance to the Negro civil rights \"leaders.\" Once the image of these Negro civil rights \"leaders\" has been blown up way beyond its proper proportion, these same Negro civil rights \"leaders\" are then used by white liberals to influence and control the Negro voters, all for the benefit of the white politicians who pose as liberals, who pose as friends of the Negro.\n\n- The Negro \"revolution\" is controlled by these foxy white liberals, by the government itself. But the black revolution is controlled only by God.\n\n- Can we prove that the Negro revolution is controlled by white liberals? Certainly! . . . the late President Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy . . . had warned these editors that they must give at least some token gains to the moderate Negro leaders in order to enhance the image of these moderate Negro leaders in the eyesight of the black masses.",

Many conservatives cry about it a lot, especially in the last six months or so.\n\nProblem: Other than convicted criminals like OJ Simpson or Harvey Weinstein, I can't really think of anyone who's actually been \"cancelled\", just people whose name was drug through the mud a little.\n\nExamples: Louis CK. Some women claimed he sexually assaulted her.  He laid low for a few months. Now he's (pre covid anyway) back doing shows. In fact if anything his material is more aggressive than ever, as he no longer has to pretend to be nice.\n\nAziz Ansari, James Franco, Woody Allen, Roman Polanski, the list goes on and on. They all still work regularly and make tons of money doing what they do. \n\nThe lady from the Mandalorian show who tweeted that being a Republican is basically the same as being a Jew in a concentration camp lost her job on that particular show, which is aimed at a family audience. However she's already getting speaking engagements and lucrative guest appearances on shows, and she'll probably end up making more money *because* she was \"cancelled\".\n\nKevin Spacey was accused of making passes at male children, but he quit his job on his Netflix show and is in a completely self imposed exile.\n\nEven Donald Trump as recently as January 7th was found in polls that 70% of America blamed him for the insurrection he obviously started. But those polls now show most Republicans beleive Antifa was behind the attacks, and he's back at the head of the Republican party, about as popular as he ever was before.\n\nTo show this isn't a partisan thing, Republicans once wanted to cancel the Dixie Chicks for being against permanent wars in the middle east. But they Dixie Chicks eventually recovered and went on some highly lucrative tours.\n\nBottom line: No one is ever actually cancelled, unless cancelled just means that you take a lot of crap in the media for a few weeks and then resume your career as though it never happened.",

        "selftext": "Alright guys, I have a writing assignment, and I need to hash this out. My position is that drugs should be legal for a myriad of reasons including but not limited to: Crime reduction, transparency, black market reduction (broadly), reductions in violent crime, freedom of choice, tax revenue/economic health, etc.\n\nMore specifically, during prohibition in the United States, for instance, there was no massive reduction in demand. This makes some amount of sense: People want to get high, and they'll find a way. As a tangential example we can look at abortion where, despite illegality, people still get abortions. That's not the greatest argument, but you catch my drift.   \n\nAlso, regulation reduces how risky a drug is to use. Many users of heavier drugs such as heroin or methamphetamine experience deleterious effects for two reasons: 1) They get addicted and help isn't available to alleviate that (criminality makes people wary to talk about things and makes it next to impossible to supply social programs relating to the crime in question) and 2) Street drugs are horribly impure. Much cocaine, for instance, is cut with all sorts of things ranging from glass shards to medications.\n\nTo be clear, if a substance can lead to societal harm, I'm fine with that being illegal. Poisons would fit under this category. Like, you can harm others with poisons en masse. Regardless, I simply don't believe there is any evidence that drugs (opium, heroin, meth, whatever) cause anything beyond personal harm. If someone is harming others while using drugs that's never, ever due to the drugs exclusively. Period. \n\nTo top this random tangle off, I'd like to note that this pans out given historical data as far as I know, and it seems like the prohibition of drugs stems predominately from historical racism, not societal harm.\n\nCMV. \n\nPS: I know that this has been done before, but I need to debate this down to the bone.\n\nThanks.",

Also, note - Im from a country that generally has a different view on those issues, so it is possible that Im culturally biased.\n\nAlso, I generalised the title a little bit - I didnt know ho to say it shortly, but I mean it in a way that ANY trans person is not a real person-of-their-not-assigned gender. But I will focus on women since being women is what I know the best. \n\nMy stance is pretty simple. In my point of view, being a woman means live as a woman from my birth. It means the weird patriarchal parts - being made to wear pink, having to have long hair, being stereotyped and often sexualised. It means having an escape plan when you are alone at a street at night, it means being uncomfortable because literally half the population is stronger than you. It means experiencing womens puberty, the sexualising that comes with it... I could list all the exemples of bad things patriarchy brought us, but you get the message. \nAll those bad parts formed me to who I am and I dont know any woman who never experienced them. Maybe not all of them, but some probably. I dont know many men who experienced the same.\n\nLets say someone transitions at 20, hell, 30. They never knew how hard it is to grow up as a girl. How you can be told to cover up because boys might be distracted. Nothing of it. They maybe saw it and felt bad, but never experienced it. They begin to live as a woman later in life, after the worst usually ends, and with the benefit of male upbringing. Sure, it probably wasnt the easiest being a trans person. But it wasnt same as being a woman. And sadly, I think in todays world, these bad experiences are almost always what forms women. \n\nI dont think I can confidently say someone is as much of a woman as I am if they are treated like women for a couple of years after the worst part of it (at least for me) ends. Being an adult, its still not ideal, but your teacher can no longer tell you your shoulders could be distracting and if they do, you can tell them to fuck themselves. \n\nI think trans women (and men) are still that - trans women (and men). We shouldnt merge those categories. We should celebrate the differences and getting comfortable with the fact, that being born a women (man)and being trans women is not the same thing. We all should have the same rights, we all should be loved and celebrated, but we are different - and we should be proud of that! Fuck, being woman has brought me so many problems and Im proud to overcome them. You should be proud of overcoming problems of being trans person! I cant claim your victory and you cant claim mine - so why do it by merging those two categories?\n\nAnything unclear I will specify. Im not native English speaker.",

If someone had a $10m investment that produced $1m in LT capital gains, they only pay 20% in taxes. If that was income, it would be 37% in taxes.\n\nWhats so bothersome for me is that this system is designed to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. By sitting down and watching your investments grow, you pay a lower tax rate than the person doing manual labor.\n\nA common argument I hear is that lower LT capital gains taxes encourage more, and longer term investments, allocating capital more efficiently with less withdrawals\n\n^Taxes are not the driver of investment decisions. And actually, theres a saying in finance that you shouldnt let the tax tail wag the dog. Its typically a bad decision to hold onto an investment solely to make it to the 1 year mark. I argue that you would see little to no change in short term vs long term holdings if the tax rate were increased.\n\nAnyway, LT capital gains tax rates should be added to income and treated equally as the income tax brackets.

        "selftext": "I would like to be convinced that Malazan's magic is great enough to continue reading the series.\n\nI've tried reading the first novel three times (because of the rave reviews) and couldn't get much farther than the siege of Pale, and I kind of want to justify reading through it. I really just enjoy stories with lots of magic, so if it's the case that Malazan has a lot of magic, then I'll keep trying, but otherwise I'm resigned to giving up on it.\n\nThe Siege of Pale was really very discouraging for me. As this is a major magical battle, I was expecting a detailed depiction / long sequence involving all the participants in the battle, of how the magic \\*interacted\\* with all the participants, what all the participants were doing, and what at least one character was sensing and feeling at the time. I want the magic to feel \\*real\\* and the characters to feel \\*intelligent\\* in how they interacted with said magic. Instead I got... oh, the battle's over now, let's just go over select parts of that battle. The description of what actually happened was very thin and sparse, leaving practically everything up to the imagination. All the battle magic was either \"shield\" or \"magic missile\" - i.e. simply a directed elemental attack with nothing else to it, even the element hardly mattered, because any characters hit simply died regardless of what element/warren was used, and the \"magic\" could have been replaced with a bullet or a spray of bullets without anything really changing - which I've seen hundreds of times in dozens of other works and just strikes me as lazy writing. Anomander was pumped up to be \\*all that\\* - and then seemed to just be yet another magic missile caster. Moon's Spawn was pumped up to be \\*all that\\* - and it had practically no role in the battle except to spawn a bunch of flyers which had a negligible impact on the battle. Considering that this was a climactic moment where lots of magic should be flying, I had to consider: is this the best the story has to offer (when it comes to magic)?\n\nContrast this with the magic of D&amp;D, Naruto, Worm, and Reverend Insanity, which has hundreds of different \\*kinds\\* of magic, each of which feel distinctly different and have different roles and strategies and counters. A super-long, epic fantasy in a high-magic setting should be able to have that, and to have a complex interplay of magic interacting with each other.\n\n*TLDR*: I know Malazan fans really exalt the magic. So I'm asking to be convinced of that. Whether it be explaining to me what's cool about the magic system, or what the author does with the magic (application) and how that magic is used in battle later on in the story, that's all great! I'm looking for details. Spoilers are totally fine! In fact, that's probably what I'm looking for / needing at this point. \n\nWhat won't change my view: \n\n* Talking about why \\*other\\* aspects of Malazan (characters, plot, prose) are worth the read.\n* Talking about how magic in Malazan is epic in scale. (Just making the magic \"bigger\" doesn't make it \\*better\\*)",

Anybody in sales or marketing knows children are a goldmine when it comes to advertising receptiveness, and if they change their advertising to be gender neutral, it only opens up the possibility of more sales. \n\nOn a more emotion based note, I think every child has wanted a toy thats meant for the opposite sex at one point in their lives.

It wouldnt kill girls to play with GI joes or hot wheels as there are plenty of female car enthusiasts and even more female soldiers nowadays. \n\n Gender neutrality will open the childs mind of what is possible for them in the future, therefore making a better balanced and honestly more productive society.

        "selftext": "For clarification, I live in the US, and I'm talking about how charitable donations and tax deductions work here; there may be different systems that work differently in other countries. I am also very liberal and believe the issue of wealth inequality is far more significant than billionaires getting criticized on social media. I just don't believe the criticism makes sense.\n\nI was watching [this video](https://youtu.be/yts2F44RqFw) by a very liberal YouTuber. In an abstract sense, the point of his video is that **conservatives tend to think of the law in terms of punishing bad actors, and liberals think of law as a means of reducing net harm done**. One of the examples he uses is conservative/liberal solutions to teen pregnancy/abortion - liberals, generally, advocate for access to contraceptives and sex education because that's been scientifically proven to reduce teen pregnancy, whereas conservatives will preach abstinence because they believe teens shouldn't be having sex in the first place, and it's society's job to shame them when they do. The video does a much better job at explaining than I am here. But basically the liberal point of view, generally, is that \"bad things will happen, but here's how we make sure it happens the least\", while conservatives, generally, say \"bad things will happen, but here's how we punish the people who do them\".\n\nSo dramatically shifting gears here, let's look at wealth inequality. Liberals, generally, believe billionaires have a social responsibility to be charitable. A single person hoarding wealth when countless others are starving/homeless/dying is not how things should be. But we also know that billionaires won't just *decide* to be charitable out of the kindness of their own hearts, or at least not consistently as they need to. So we instead make charitable donations tax deductible. The bad thing of hoarding wealth still happens, but with the write-offs they happen a lot less because this policy is in place.\n\nSo with that in mind, from a liberal's perspective, a billionaire (or a corporation) making a huge donation for the purpose of a tax deduction is a good thing. But over and over again I see liberals bringing up the fact that the billionaire had selfish motivations as if it's a gotcha. Isn't that how the system was *designed*? Is it *news* to you that billionaires are selfish and we need to give them an incentive for objectively good things to happen?\n\nIt's sort of like the access to contraceptives/sex education argument - liberals will conclude that conservatives don't *really* care about reducing the number of abortions or teen pregnancies, they just want to condemn people for having unsafe sex. I can just as easily conclude (most) liberals don't *really* care about charities having enough money to function due to donations from the ultra-wealthy, they just want to condemn the ultra-wealthy for being greedy. Note that I'm not saying these things are equally severe, but that they come from the same flawed idea that shaming people into doing the \"right\" thing has ever worked on a societal scale, or the even more fucked up idea that because a law is designed in a way that circumvents morality that its resulting harm reduction doesn't \"count\". There are other notable examples of liberals valuing what *should* work over what has been proven to, but I do want to focus on the tax reduction/charity example.\n\nThat last paragraph is the central part of my view. I believe everything else I've written as well, but nit-picking minor details won't change my view as much as proving to me why shaming people for doing a bad thing is only effective/relevant sometimes.\n\nThanks",

        "selftext": "Unemployment income should not be taxed as income in the US, and here is why.\n\n1. To qualify for unemployment, you have to be working and therefore most likely payed into the unemployment pool and to be taxed when you are already down feels like double dipping into the pockets of hurting Americans. \n\n2. If you receive a child dividend or a stimulus check or a portion of social security, it is not taxed as income because the idea is that the income is suppose to offset natural expenses such as having a child which is good for the economy or the idea that you are retired and payed your dues. Unemployment dips into both those categories. Taking care of those at a loss of employment helps cover the cost and also understands that most people have been paying into unemployment for sometime and it is due to them. \n\n3. Self-employed people working at home when they don't make a profit can count expenses such as a portion of their  mortgage, utilities, etc. as an expense and generally write off the expenses to offset future profit. Shouldn't unemployment have that same option to say \"Hey I am trying to apply for a job, but I still have a home, utilities, etc. And in no way making a profit. My expenses offset my profit from unemployment, therefore taxing doesn't make sense when I am working at a loss. \n\n4. The budget could easily be more than satisfied by taxing the wealth of those at the winning end instead of the losing end. Removing corporate tax breaks, local and state tax breaks, Increasing tax on things such as dividends or a wealth tax easily would bring in more income than taxing the unemployed. Meanwhile economic evidence shows that unemployed people will reinvest their income back into the economy compared to things such as dividend profits. \n\n\nChange my mind!",

        "selftext": "Often, teenagers get their phones taken away by their parents. I am a teenager myself, and I recently had my phone taken away. However, instead of becoming more productive, I just became addicted to other things such as Reddit and Youtube.\n\nThis brings me to my view. If a teenager has more that one device that they can get distracted on, taking away their phone would actually do absolutely nothing except change their addiction. \n\nI think this because of the following: In a way, drug addictions and phone addictions are very similar. They're both addictions that can hurt you in the long run. With drug addictions, when you try to go cold turkey, you may experience drug withdrawal symptoms, which may make it hard for you to stay cold turkey. Wouldn't the same things happen with phones? Phone addictions act as a band-aid for things such as boredom and anxiety. This boredom and anxiety acts as a barrier between you and your work. When you remove that band-aid, then the boredom and anxiety come back. This will bring back the barrier between you and your work, and guess what! There are other possible band-aids such as things such as Twitter (online), Instagram (online), Youtube, Reddit, and various other band-aids. Even when it's not online, it can still be a black hole. All this does is change your addiction.\n\nI'd love to hear evidence that goes against my view. Thanks for reading!",

Being a human isn't just about meeting basic survival needs and nothing else.\n\nI think that if somebody pays for electricity or generates their own, they are free to use it however they like. I did the math recently and video gamers use about the same amount of electricity as Bitcoin. Who's to say that one is more important than the other?\n\nSame thing with Christmas lights. Americans use more energy than entire countries just to run Christmas lights. Is it required for survival? Nope. You could say it's a waste. But people simply want to put lights up, and they've paid for the electricity, so we all agree they are entitled to.\n\nAlso I have another connected view that there are some cryptos which are neutral or even good for the environment that still use proof-of-work mining. For example, Monero mining works best on a CPU rather than a specialized ASIC, so the majority of Monero miners are using spare CPU cycles on servers. These CPUs would have been on and using power regardless, but to do nothing. But by mining with them, they convert that power which would have been wasted into a useful process. I would say that's a net positive.\n\nContrast that with Bitcoin mining, where people just buy warehouses full of special equipment to mine Bitcoin but do nothing else.",

        "title": "CMV: Trans sports bans are a solution in search of a problem",
        "selftext": "Various states across the US are pushing new legislation aiming at banning trans kids from participating in sports in schools and colleges. The details of the bills vary, but most of them target the participation of trans kids in one way or another. An excerpt from Mississippi SB 2536:\n\n&gt;&gt;      SECTION 3.  Designation of athletic teams.  (1)   Interscholastic or intramural athletic teams or sports that are sponsored by a public primary or secondary school or any school that is a member of the Mississippi High School Activities Association or public institution of higher education or any higher education institution that is a member of the NCAA, NAIA or NJCCA shall be expressly designated as one of the following based on biological sex:\n\n&gt;&gt;          (a)  \"Males,\" \"men\" or \"boys;\"\n\n&gt;&gt;          (b)  \"Females,\" \"women\" or \"girls;\" or\n\n&gt;&gt;          (c)  \"Coed\" or \"mixed.\"\n\n&gt;&gt;     (2)  Athletic teams or sports designated for \"females,\" \"women\" or \"girls\" shall not be open to students of the male sex.\n\nThis is a common thread through these laws. The law also specifies its reason for this: \n\n&gt;&gt;           (e)  The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural levels of testosterone, explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport:  categorically different strength, speed and endurance.\n\nThe purpose of this bill, according to the state legislature, is to ensure that sports remain fair. Because if trans women competed with women, it would be unfair, because they have an inherent advantage. \n\nThat said, is \"trans athletes dominating women's sports\" actually an issue that Mississippi has? The associated press reached out to Lawmakers in Mississippi and numerous other states, [and found](https://apnews.com/article/lawmakers-unable-to-cite-local-trans-girls-sports-914a982545e943ecc1e265e8c41042e7): \n\n&gt;&gt; Legislators in more than 20 states have introduced bills this year that would ban transgender girls from competing on girls sports teams in public high schools. **Yet in almost every case, sponsors cannot cite a single instance in their own state or region where such participation has caused problems.**\n\nThe article is fascinating, and worth a read. Another excerpt:\n\n&gt;&gt; Theres no authoritative count of how many trans athletes have competed recently in high school or college sports. Neither the NCAA nor most state high school athletic associations collect that data; in the states that do collect it, the numbers are minimal: No more than five students currently in Kansas, nine in Ohio over five years. \n\nThe lawmakers proposing these bills are not doing so because they see a problem that desperately needs solving. Because that \"problem\" _doesn't exist_. Just like with the infamous \"bathroom bills\", the threat is, at best, completely hypothetical. (It is possibly worth noting at this point that the bathroom bills were pushed by a group who [knew they were making it up](https://www.intomore.com/impact/anti-lgbtq-activist-admits-bathroom-predator-myth-was-concocted-as-cover-for-transphobic-hate/).) Trans women are not dominating women's sports. This seriously calls into question the claim in the bill itself, that trans women have significant advantages over cis women, which is its primary justification for existing. And the fact that the people proposing these laws most commonly cannot name a single trans athlete in their state that they would consider mentioning as justification for this bill indicates to me that they _know_ that there isn't a problem worth solving, and are moving forward with these bills anyways.\n\nThese bills exist not to combat any actual problem, but rather to further marginalize trans people for the sake of marginalizing trans people. \n\nChange my view.",

        "selftext": "Recently Douglas County, NV passed tougher vacation rental rules, one of which is that no adult under 25 can be the primary renter on a short term rental agreement.\n\nThe reasoning given by the commissioners and members of the public is that they claim young adults are louder and litter more, causing more disruption to full-time residents and strain on public services. No data was provided on citations or violations by age group to confirm this assumption, or why 25 is the age at which renters supposedly mature enough that were willing to accept them in our county. Just a few anecdotal stories from a couple residents about kids having wild parties and pictures of litter.\n\nThis seems like making an age rule to fix a noise problem and a trash problem. Why not make a noise rule to fix a noise problem and a trash rule to fix a trash problem? There are already quiet hours, noise fines, capacity restrictions, littering citations, etc. that directly address the problems of noise and trash in the county.\n\nThere are scenarios where ideal renters will be banned only because of their age and the commission acknowledges that fact, but says the county has no legal burden to treat adult renters equally based on age. I find it difficult to not see this rule as age discrimination.",

That money gets loaned to people who are buying houses, cars, college tuition, etc. The vast majority of people couldn't buy a house without a loan. It's just too much cash to pay up front.\n\nMy view is that when a rich person just leaves a bunch of money in the bank, it is actually helping society in a lot of subtle ways. And also remember the \"money multiplier\" effect from economics class: assuming a 10% reserve ratio, banks can cumulatively loan out $10 for every $1 that's deposited.\n\nSo for example, say we taxed $10 million dollars out of some rich guy's account and spent it to build a bridge. But now that means that $100 million worth of loans that could've been given out are no longer available. That $100 million of loans could have financed 10 bridges!\n\nWhich also means interest rates go up because the supply of loanable money went down! So it's harder for normal people to get loans, and the cost goes up.\n\nMy view is that rich people hoarding wealth in banks is actually a net positive on society, and in most cases it provides a net benefit greater than what we could get by taxing it, taking it, and spending it.",

Washington DC is a federal city, and therefore should be treated as a city, not a state.\n2. The difference between DC and Puerto Rico is that DC is one municipality, Puerto Rico is not. Furthermore, DC has *some* representation, having 3 electoral votes and a house representative, which as I stated above, is more than sufficient (at least IMO) for a city. However, Puerto Rico and other territories have neither of these.\n3. One reason why some people want DC statehood is for the two senators, which essentially is two democrat senators (since DC is an overwhelmingly democrat area). The fact that DC is democratic in itself is not a problem at all. However, when some people (I'm not saying there are a lot of them) try to push statehood for the whole purpose of gaining control of the senate, I find it very problematic, and I would go as far as to say that it would be a form of gerrymandering.\n\nTl;dr: DC is a city and therefore should not receive statehood.\n\nChange My View.",

        "selftext": "For those who haven't heard, r/superstraight was recently banned. \n\nr/superstraight (and the whole identity/movement/group outside the subreddit) was in part a sub dedicated to a legitimate sexuality as no doubt many of the cis folks there were, in fact, only attracted to other cisgender people. You would think on that basis alone reddit should have left the sub alone - AFAIK they only police sexualities when there are legal concerns involved around things like consent such as in the case of pedophilia or beastiality. \n\nBut it was also in part a very obvious satire subreddit. For a few years now there has been a very woke narrative propagated by *some* (and I do stress *some*) trans folks and trans rights activists that since trans people are the gender they identify with its therefore transphobic to not be attracted to them simply for being trans, even if they're not post op i.e. a lesbian would be considered transphobic for not wanting to sleep with a trans woman just because she has a penis. r/superstraight was pushing back against that narrative, and it was doing so straight out of the woke playbook - using language about how superstraight is a sexuality between consenting adults and must be respected and to do otherwise is hateful and bigoted, etc. The woke contingent i mentioned earlier promptly rose and took the bait, slandering the r/superstraight crowd as alt right nazi TERF fascist bigots etc., which was a secondary goal of r/superstraight; to show how quickly those woke folks will disregard their own logic and principles and flip the script when they perceive a group they champion as under attack even if its... not, frankly. \n\nOn both counts I'd say r/superstraight worked wonderfully, and did nothing whatsoever ban-worthy. \n\nNow, I'll be the first to concede that some small minority of the people on r/superstraight were there for the wrong reasons, i.e. they were legitimate transphobes who hated trans people. No argument there. But, frankly, so what? If r/superstraight *didnt* have a small bigoted fringe it would be one of like 0.01% of ideological subreddits that didn't. Yes, *some* people on r/superstraight were just there because they hated trans people, but some people are on r/LGBT because they hate straight/cis people; some feminists just hate men; some black folks joined BLM marches because they hate whites; some people only participate in liberal/leftist subreddits to promote violence against the right; etc. It seems to me that if you like and/or are a part of a group youre quick to denounce such people as a non representative fringe, while if you dislike a group (as many woke folks did superstraight) you pretend the fringes are the majority, if not the entirety, of the group. That seems to have been the tactic employed against r/superstraight, and unfortunately it seems to have worked. But in my view they didn't deserve it. \n\nCMV.",

        "selftext": "NFT(Non-fungible tokens) have become all the rage this year and I think they are just another step in monetizing the rich and stupid.\n   \nMy understanding is that NFT's are unique numbers that exist on a blockchain. They are then tied to something, mostly \"moments\", and sold to people at a premium to own that unique blockchain ID.\n  \n-Examples would be the Tacobell NFTs today, Kings of Leon recently announcing the release of an album as an NFT, and a digital version of a Banksy artwork selling for $380,000 after the real version burned. Also the big one that cements a lot of this for me, things like Logan Paul releasing an NFT as part of a large Pokemon box opening event when the event is already purchasing their name/moment to be a part of the livestream before NFTs. The NFT addition to that is literally just a reminder the event happened that they hope to see raise in price and sell off later as opposed to a video to look back on. It served no purpose in enhancing the experience of anyone other then those who directly profit from the NFT.\n  \n----\nSorry my thoughts are a bit all over the place with this subject. It has caused me some overwhelming anxiety to see creators/subjects that I am passionate about diving headlong into this trend, while already feeling like I am being priced out of their fandom by seeing insane prices being tied to stuff like concerts/tickets/albums/art. \n----\n     ​\nNot a problem:\n-Being able to verify a digital art piece as the original and sell it as an NFT? Sounds awesome and makes sense to me as it reflects the real world original versus print relationship. \n  \nProblems:\n-Attaching an NFT to a set of 5 identical gifs of a moment that happened in a live game and then selling them as collector items associated with a specific person and not turning any royalties(or what ever it would be here) over to that player/ref/coach.\n-Bands attaching lifetime concert seats to NFTs (this quickly will become NFT *exclusive* concerts/albums/etc) \n  \nI view the majority of these NFT's as just another marketing scheme cooked up to monetize a moment that already was, like taking these moment in a sports game or concert and attaching them to a gif from a livestream literal hundreds of thousands watched.\n  \nThe thing that makes the closest sense to me has been trading cards. I understand people seeking first editions of players or characters they are connected to and how that is of a higher value to them than unlimited print runs. Those are actual limited object. There may only be 5 of that card in print ever and to own one would be awesome, or could be an investment for someone who thinks it's price will raise. Similarly, There may only be 5 NFT's of this moment in this game ever, a reproduceable and already not unique item, why would I want to own one other then it being an investment? It make sense to me how they are damn near identical there, but then I cringe to think about a world which requires some ridiculous priced trading card to see a Lakers game, or an NFT just to go see a concert because the band sold off their entire tour as NFT moment tickets to be collected at a premium. Leading to things like those who could and want to scooped up as many \"collectibles\" as they could get greatly defining the fandom as is currently the case in things like Pokemon TCG.\n  \nThanks for taking the time to read and/or reply.",

        "title": "CMV: Only states that were once sovereign should get representation in the Senate.",
        "selftext": "The U.S. Senate is an odd feature of our political system, and I think there are two basic paths to justifying it:\n\n1. For some reason, people in South Dakota are just more important than people in Iowa and *much* more important than people in California, so they *deserve* more representation.  This argument is so ridiculous that I find it hard to believe that anyone actually thinks it true, but I've encountered frequently (e.g., rural states are special because they produce food which is, somehow, more important than the food produced in California I guess and doesn't really explain why Alaska should get Senate seats)\n2. There's something special about states as such that makes them deserving of representation for reasons having nothing to do with population.  I can see merit in variants of this argument, but it ignores the fact that not all states are created equal.\n\nMany U.S. states were created arbitrarily as a way to gerrymander the Senate.  The Dakota territory was split into two states in order to give Republicans extra Senate seats, for example.  Nevada was split from Utah to give Lincoln extra votes in the 1864 election.  There's no reason to respect that.  Most of the pre-Civil War states were created as part of political bargains to maintain the balance of power between slave and free states.  \n\nOn the other hand, certain states were originally sovereign and voluntarily gave up that sovereignty as part of a bargain that included Senate seats (the 13 original colonies, Vermont, Texas, Hawaii sort of; I think that's it but maybe I missed one).  Among the original colonies, the small states only agreed to join the union (which they had every right not to join) on the basis of a deal that gave them extra Senate representation.  It would be, in a certain sense, unfair to renege on that bargain, and similar arrangements are common in other cases where units have voluntarily given up sovereignty in order to join a union (e.g., equal representation in the UN General Assembly, the European Council, or the Swiss Council of States).  \n\nThis argument makes logical sense.  The states were sovereign.  They gave up that sovereignty in return for something and we need to honor the deal.  But that bargain doesn't apply to the majority of US states that never had sovereignty and were created for the purposes of gerrymandering the Senate.  Missouri (for example) never had the option to go off on its own and did not sacrifice any sovereignty in order to join the union.  It consequently has no claim to Senate representation on the basis of some kind of states rights and (to the extent that we have a Senate), it shouldn't get any representation there.\n\nDoes this create inequality? Yes, but the Senate is already highly unequal and this form of inequality at least has some kind of logical basis other than the transparently absurd claim that South Dakotans are just way more important than everyone else.  It's no worse than the current arrangement. (So far as it goes, I'd rather abolish the Senate or have a proportional one but that's a separate issue).\n\nTL;DR: The Senate was created as part of a bargain to convince independent states to give up their sovereignty.  The original colonies (and a couple of other states) actually participated in such a bargain and gave up sovereignty, so they should receive Senate seats in return.  States that had no sovereignty to give up gave nothing so they should receive nothing.",

I bought a bottle of water today and I paid sales tax on it, in a year, Im not going to get a bill in the mail for tax again on that bottle of water.  I dont see why my house isnt treated like this.  The government can arbitrarily raise property tax rates on property as well according to what the government thinks your property is worth.  This figure is routinely wrong, and typically too high.  If you decide to renovate your house and they find out, theyll up your tax bill.  I remember a few years ago, I helped my aunt and uncle decided to add a patio in their back yard, and we did all the work ourselves.  The city found out about it and raised their tax bill.  To add insult to injury, if you cant pay, the government can simply kick you out of your house and seize your property.  \n\nInstead of this system, property taxes should be implemented as a sales tax like on virtually all over purchases.  Using the water example again, I bought that bottle and paid sales tax on it at the time of purchase, and never have to worry about being taxed on it again.  Sales tax in my state is 8.75%, why not instead institute a fixed percentage of tax on property sales, and once you pay that set amount of tax off, you dont have to pay anymore property taxes.  This way people do not get priced out of their homes due to gentrification and seniors arent forced to move out of something they own because they cannot pay the government.",

I believe the same can be said about a lot of entertainment today; such as modern block buster movies, tv shows, and social media. Most of these things have little to offer in terms of lasting value. Like junk food they may taste good(be entertaining) in the short term but all you really did was fill your brain with empty calories.

        "selftext": "Generally speaking, there are 3 sizes of laptops: 13 inch, 15 inch, and 17 inch. \n\n13 inch laptops are usually very light, fit into any backpack, and feel the most sturdy. They will receive less damage if you drop them due to their weight and if you have a laptop for 5 years, you will drop it a couple times. \n\n13 inch laptops do not have super mid discrete GPUs which although produce much better graphics than integrated graphics, are also very heavy and use a lot of power and usually produce extra heat. If you want graphics, then you should have a pc. With a PC, you can have the best graphics without having to be stuck with default laptop designs that cannot be changed. The graphics card of a laptop should not be a selling point because the higher up you go in graphics, the exponentially less battery you will get. Isnt mobility and freedom from the wall the most prominent idea of what a laptop is?\n\n13 inch laptops usually do not have incredible speakers. However, this should be a non-issue, because theyre made for cafes or work where a person already has headphones in. They work enough to hear them while you cook or clean, and so they are totally fine in my opinion.\n\n13 inch laptops are also perfect for laying in bed where you can put it on your legs while you type laying down, and often times have edge to edge keyboards. This mean that in bed, you will receive less strain on your wrists. It also means that you barely feel the laptop on your body. \n\n13 inch laptops look great with 1080p, so you dont have to settle on terrible battery life should you go for a 4K laptop in the larger builds. Yes, I know that the larger builds also have larger batteries, but they also use more power in general. That said, I think that it is fairly equal and that you will get better battery on a 1080p 13 inch laptop bs a 4K 17 inch. \n\nYou also dont need THAT much screen. I think that 13 inches is totally enough.\n\n15 and 17 inch laptops are almost like portable desktops. This is okay if you dont have a desktop, but youre also settling on the keyboard, trackpad, speakers, camera, etc. that is default in the computer and you cannot change that. At least in a PC, although not mobile, you can customize every little piece to your liking. A 13 inch laptop says, I dont care about that stuff, were going out to Starbucks and youre gonna love it. Youre not stuck inside and Im taking you out. \n\nI am open to changing my mind. I have a 15 inch laptop and so Im open to the idea. So if you can dispute my points, then I will gladly discuss it. No hate to the 17ers out there, I just think that 17 inches is so big that you cant even go anywhere with them. \n\nYes I understand that 15 inch laptops are a good middle ground, but i think that youre settling on super average dGPUs, webcams, and everything of the like. A specced put PC and a mobile 13 inch is the best way to go in my opinion and CHANGE MY VIEW!\n\nP.S. 13 inch laptops almost NEVER have that thing where the screen is so big that is flops around when you move it.",

        "selftext": "In recent years much has been said about the need for greater diversity in many aspects (gender, race, sexuality etc.) in many different industries, including the arts (film, publishing, music etc.).\n\nLike most people, my view is that this push for diversity is a good and important thing. At the same time, it does not follow that attempting to mandate diversity on an \\*individual\\*, specific level necessarily makes sense.\n\nThis all sounds rather vague and may seem counter-intuitive, so I'll give an example: Recently there was an uproar (online, of course) when it was announced that the poet Amanda Gorman's forthcoming collection \\*The Hill We Climb\\* would be translated into Dutch by a white non-binary translator, Marieke Lucas Rijneveld.  The furore seemed to stem largely from the fact that the translator is not a black female (c.f. Gorman). Under a lot of (unfair) pressure, Rijneveld stepped down.\n\nMy view is that instances such as this are not a good trend, nor a progressive one. It makes perfect sense to lobby for diversity in translating, but approximately zero sense to demand that Rijneveld be removed on the basis of identity. The implicit suggestion is that competency is (at least partly) determined by identity, and this idea ought to be rejected as fallacious. It represents an overemphasis on identity that is very much in vogue, despite its logical implications being potentially absurd.\n\n E.g. if applied to acting - 'this person can't play a woman, because they're non-binary, so they're not in the best position to understand'. In theatre/film/tv, the whole notion looks sillier than it does for translations, because it's antithetical to the nature of performance. Of course there is a cruel irony in the Rijneveld situation, because flawed identity-matching logic, for lack of a better term, has previously been used in defence of gender diverse people ('trans should only be played by trans'). \n\nThe real problem is the bigger, systemic picture - one where people are \\*disregarded\\* on the basis of their identity by industry, and by society more broadly. But it's hard to change, and hard to observe in action. It's easier to apply pressure at the individual level ('\\[X\\] should not be in this role!!'), so that's what happens - even when it's irrational and causes another unfairness itself.",

        "selftext": "I mean only 9% of the population are actually gifted (above 120). Around 34% of people have at least a bachelors degree. However, only 16.1% of people have a IQ above 115, that leaves 17.9% of college students to possibly have a IQ below 110 (this is especially the case when not all gifted people make it through college or even go to college right away). \n\nI mean I think a IQ of 90 is the minimum for which understanding of certain complex concepts would occur. Usually most people with at least a 85 IQ have common sense.\n\nA average IQ is enough to do most jobs, except for maybe a physicist or mathematician. It's enough to get a STEM degree, if you really try your best.\n\nThis is based off of my experience as a transfer student at a community college. I know from experience that people of average intelligence are usually not slow (well unless they're in a PhD program for math or physics, or are taking a upper level math class as a math major,for example). \n\nBy average intelligence, I mean that you're overall normal in terms or intellectual ability. A IQ of below 85 is not normal nor is a being gifted. \n\nAverage intelligence is enough to understand economics, The nauces of governance, Science, Etc. It's enough for the job as president. I know 99% of the people at my local community college could be able to somewhat easily understand the vast nuances of governance and economics if they're inclined to do so, And they could be able to do the job of a president overall very well. This is from my experience as a student (now a 20 year old sophomore) at a local community college. I took microeconomics and macroeconomics and many other classes and discovered that 99% of the people aren't at all slow, And I'm sure that less than 20% of the students I met have a IQ in the gifted range. I tested a IQ of 100 and I know another student tested a IQ of 93 and from what I observed neither I nor the other students really struggle with calculus or the soft sciences (usually being president requires a ability to be able to understand and apply concepts in the soft sciences, Which is definitely in the range of ability for a person with at least average intelligence). Usually the school environment is mainly tailored for those people with average intelligence (even at certain colleges) and gifted people would actually suffer at a community college or regular school. In other words, It's possible that Biden and Obama and Clinton and Bush isn't all that much smarter than the average person or even a majority of the population. Average intelligence is still intelligent, Just not as intelligent as someone whose gifted.\n\nIt's not that Biden, Or Bush is particularly intelligent (means above average intelligence), It's just that they're smarter as compared to Trump (but that's only because Trump set a very low bar). Would they have been considered intelligent if the bar is set higher (like at the level of that of a gifted person?), probably not.",

        "selftext": "In the past few days I've seen people repeatedly claim that some cisgender people are being pressured into dating transgender people against their will, specifically by being shamed and called transphobic. Often the people making this claim say they support trans people in general and attribute this problem to a problematic \"vocal minority\". I don't think there is such a vocal minority. I don't think this happens at all. I believe the phenomenon has been completely fabricated as part of a recent far-right troll campaign to fuel animosity towards trans people.\n\nAs for why I believe this: I'm trans myself, several of my friends and much of my online social circle are trans, and I'm a therapist who works specifically with trans people, meaning I'm privy to the private opinions of a large, diverse group of trans people. I have never seen any of them say it would be transphobic for a cis person not to date them, except maybe as an obvious joke. Before the past week or so, I had only seen openly anti-trans groups (specifically TERFs) talk about this as a problem, but suddenly I'm seeing large numbers of nominally supportive people saying it too. All of this started at the same time as the \"Super Straight\" trend on social media, which I believe is connected. I think the people spreading this misconception are either maliciously lying, or have been misled into believing in an imaginary problem by said malicious liars.\n\nWhat I ideally want to be convinced of is that at least one person has at some point seriously argued that rejecting a trans person is, in and of itself, *inherently* transphobic or proves that a person holds transphobic views. For this to happen, I'd just need to see a single instance of this happening (ideally in an audio/video recording or direct link to a social media post from prior to February 21, 2021, the day the viral TikTok video that coined the term Super Straight was posted). This will immediately result in a partial change of my view unless I'm able to find compelling counter-evidence that the incident either didn't really happen or that the person involved was misinterpreted, making a joke, or trolling. From there, fully changing my view would most likely require showing that this occurs semi-regularly beyond the single incident, and/or explaining why people only seemed to become aware of this as a problem just recently if it's been occurring for some time.\n\nI'm making this thread because I have asked for this kind of evidence in multiple conversations with different people about this, and so far none of them have provided it. I admit that it seems pretty likely that something like what I'm describing has happened at least *once*, and I recognize that if it's a very rare phenomenon, it may be very difficult if not impossible to meet the standard of evidence I'm asking for. However, if that's the case, I would argue this proves my view that there is no \"vocal minority\" of trans people doing this--if this is really as much of a problem as it's purported to be, strong and unambiguous evidence of it happening should be readily available and easy to find. If my logic here is wrong, I'm open to having my view changed on this as well.",

        "selftext": "This is one of things that I've tried to understand multiple times. Ive had tons of discussions with people who think differently than me in this scenario and they've never came close to changing my mind. Maybe their arguments sucked though. I keep hearing this is racist and it does not seem racist in the slightest to me. I would love to have my mind changed. If I'm missing something I'm open to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNormally when talking to people they give me the same 2-3 reasons.\n\n1. It cost money and black people are statistically pooer than white people.\n2. Even if they were free black people lack transportion and thet wouldn't be able to get there.\n3. The hours that polling places are open make it difficult to get off work\n4. All of these stem from the fact that black people have oppressed and these are unfair to the poor minority community.  \n\n\nI'm not getting these arguments from random people on twitter. They also come from offical articles.\n\nWhite people have jobs too. You can argue that voting should be a national holiday, but it isn't. For anyone. So until we do we all have to schedule around it. It's not supression to make us figure it out. Ask for time off, get someone to cover, etc. We all have to make arrangements. That's not racist. it's life\n\nIt's not the goverments job to provide transportation. Saying it's racist because black people don't have cars seems like a joke excuse if i can be honest.\n\nDon't have a car? Okay white people don't have cars too. Is it also the goverments job to take you to and from work everyday? If you can figure that out you can figure out a ride to vote. its not supression because the goverment doesn't buy you an uber. \n\nIt's typically fairly cheap to get an ID. If this is a homeless person who doesn't have money maybe we can talk. If cost $10 you can figure something out. If you can't spare $10 to get an ID then voting is the least of your concerns. \n\nYou need an ID to buy Beer, Smokes, drive or see tits. It's only natural you would to vote.  \nAre Drivers license racist too?\n\nThe most common pushback I get is along the lines of \"You don't undedrstand it's underlining issues it's just not that simple\" \n\nI ask this question in response. \"If I pick you up and drop you off at the Licensing department and give you $20 could you get it?\n\nIt feels like everything that isn't overly convient is passed as supression now. I've had people tell me that its supression because long lines make people wait for a while. That was in the news. That's beyond stupid. Yeah a lot of people wanna vote. Wait in line like all of us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm all for FREE goverment IDs. That wouldn't change how I feel. The ID is what matters. \n\nI'm open to seeing it differently. But I've tried and it's not there. Drivers License aren't racist. Strip clubs aren't racist. This isn't different just because its' voting.",

I think it might be worse for juvenile inmates where theres zero mental health help, no actual incentive to help anyone behind bars. Perhaps the merciful thing would be to kill them all. I suppose one can argue that prison is meant to be hellish in order to be an eternal punishment, but I honestly have lost faith in the legal system as a whole. This specifically applies to American prisons Im sure prisons elsewhere are more geared towards helping the mentally ill. But here they might as well just throw someone in a tiny cage and feed them crumbs of bread while laughing and itd probably be more humane than the pitiful examples we have all over the US. \n\nPlease change my mind, honestly.

        "title": "CMV: Frosted Caribou is part of the problem",
        "selftext": "Context: The Pokemon TCG is going through arguably it's biggest boom since its inception. I believe there are 3 main points contributing to this boom.  \n\n\n1. Individuals are now old enough to be both rich and nostalgic for Pokemon. Sealed Base Set Boxes are going for over $400k. Logic bought a graded Charizard at auction for $220k. This has renewed interest in the hobby as people rediscover it.\n2. The Pokemon Company has done an absolutely outstanding job with the various rarities / foils / art in their latest sets. As a lifelong TCG fan, this is probably the most fun I've had opening packs. It's also led to lifelong fans sticking with it, and buying more.\n3.  Covid has had impacts on production and distribution for everyone, including the Pokemon TCG.\n\nThis has led to an environment where scalping / buyouts are at an all time high. Don't believe me? Go to any big box retail store, chances are you won't find a single pack of Pokemon cards on the shelves. Go there on restock day, and chances are you'll find a line of people waiting for the stocker to come through.  \n\n\nA Pokemon TCG Youtuber by the name of Frosted Caribou put out a video titled \"How did Pokmon TCG get here?\" (Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWZAx59eQOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWZAx59eQOs)). In it, she constructs a timeline of events explaining this situation. In it, she emphasizes that people like Logan Paul, who are looking at Pokemon TCG as an investment opportunity according to her, are the main causes of this problem and are the reason why causal players/collectors can't get their hands on anything for MSRP anymore. She also takes the stance that she is, \"giving the causals a voice in this epidemic\". This is the part I take issue with.  \n\n\nWhile she isn't wrong, I believe her to be just as much of the problem as anyone else. She's uploading multiple videos a week where she's opening sealed product. She highlights in the video that she is privileged with the fact that she has sponsors that send her product to open. Also worth mentioning that she's giving away product during most of her videos as well.   \n\n\nAs I see it, there are a few ways that her sponsors are getting product to her, none of which are helping causal collectors get their hands on any product:  \n\n\n1. Her sponsors are scalpers themselves. They're the ones camping the aisles of local retail stores and sniping the product so that she can open it and they can make money off her audience.\n2. They're buying directly from scalpers, therefore supporting their scalping practices. As long as people are paying their prices, scalpers will continue to do their thing. \n3. They're buying product for the prices set by the scalpers. Let's I'm little jimmy and I pick up a few packs by chance. I later find out that they're selling online for 3x the amount I paid for them. They're not worth opening to me at that price, so I resell them online. While not directly buying from a scalper, they're paying the prices that are being enabled by scalpers, therefore supporting the system.\n4. She's sponsored by either a distributor, or someone with a direct connection with a distributor. This is probably the least egregious scenario, but she's still essentially hording product for herself / getting an unfair amount.\n\nFrom my perspective, if she wanted to actually help the little guy in this situation, she'd commit to not doing product opening videos until things settle down. Instead, she's merely grandstanding and pointing fingers instead of actually owning up to her part in the current situation.\n\nArguments I don't find compelling at the moment:\n\n* \"*But it's her job!*\" - Cool, doesn't really change anything. It's Logan Paul's job too. Either they're both wrong/right for what they're doing.\n* \"*But she actually plays the game!\" -* Cool, doesn't really change anything. There are other individuals she called out in her video that also play the game. In fact, I'd say this almost an additional mark **against** her. If she were a dedicated pack opening channel, I'd be asking her to pause her livelihood entirely. But she also frequently uploads/streams Pokemon TCG Online / in person content. Which means she could easily transition to that full time for the time being. \n* \"*But she doesn't look at Pokemon like an investment!*\" - Cool, I genuinely have no idea why this would ever matter, but it's something she demonizes in her video, and her fans are using as a way to justify her content vs. others. Not looking at it as an investment doesn't stop the fact that she would certainly lookup the card price before selling it. She isn't oblivious to the secondary market, and she would certainly make sure to get a fair price for her cards.\n* \"*But she admires the art of cards that are worthless!*\" *-* By far one of the dumbest arguments I've heard used in her defense. I'm sure Logan Paul also liked looking at the different cards as he cracks the expensive base set.\n\nSo please, make me see her as the savior she's trying to paint herself as instead of a hypocrite.",

That said, even according to NASA's climate change page, basically what I pick up on is the weather will get more severe, coast lines will come in significantly, etc.\n\nPerhaps the worst I've heard is that it will likely have a serious effect on our ability to grow crops, especially to the degree we do now. This will lead to a significant rise in starvation and we may well face famine.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. I absolutely see the severity of that, and it is infuriating how avoidable it is. But people act like the human species is about to die out. I just don't see that happening. Frankly it seems more likely to force humanity to adjust its course than to outright stop it. \n\nThat's not to say some environmental damage we do isn't potentially extremely serious, for instance, letting major parts of the Amazon burn has long reaching effects beyond climate change. \n\nBut as far as climate change itself, I really don't see it destroying humanity. A lot of people might die and that is obviously horrible and should be prevented, but humanity isn't going to go extinct and probably won't be the most devastating thing we've faced as a species.\n\nFor instance, the plague killed 60% of everyone in Europe.

        "title": "CMV: Traditional Saftey Razors are Superior to Modern Disposable Razors",
        "selftext": "As stated in the title. I believe that old fashioned double-sided safety razor blades are superior to modern \"disposable\" razor blades due to the following factors.\n\n**1) COST**\n\nFirst and easiest to address point is cost. Looking at the first 10 items for sale on amazon for each product and averaging the cost per unit the difference is clear. The mean cost per unit for disposable razor blades is $2.65 (min $1.64, max $4.43) whereas the mean cost for double-sided safety razor blades is $$.176 (min $.07, max $.53). \n\n**2) Effectiveness**\n\nSecondly, double sided safety razors are more effective at shaving than modern disposable razors. Out of the box, both are equally sharp. However, the blade is removable on safety razors and has more clearance (the gap between blade and surface), unlike disposable razors. This results in safety razors not clogging as easily as disposable blades and are easier to clean if that happens. This also means double sided safety razors can more effectively shave longer hairs. Furthermore, the blade can be dried which prevents rust which preserves the blade edge longer resulting in a better shave and reduced knicks. \n\n**3) Environmental Impact**\n\nThirdly, double sided safety razors are more environmentally friendly than disposable razors. The fact is that disposable razors are not recyclable because of mixed metal and plastic. Double sided safety blades are all metal and can be easily recycled. Even if they do end up in the landfill the metal will eventually oxidize into its components and be reintegrated into the environment. Plastic on disposable blades will persist for many years and even when broken down remains harmful as micro-plastics.\n\n**4) Versatility**\n\nLastly, double sided safety razors are more versatile than disposable blades. I am not locked into one brand of blade with double sided safety razor blades because they are all one convention. Disposable blades require the convention of the handle one is using. This means that a new handle is required to use a different brand of blade or if the model being used is discontinued.",

The corporations and makers follow consumer trends, they noticed it was typically boys having GI Joe, video games, etc bought for them and grouped these to get more sales and vice versa with girl toys. Im guessing it worked since the toy business isnt hurting fiscally. But if your kid (regardless of gender) picks up a Barbie and wants it, buy it or dont its your decision as the parent, but if you say No thats an x-gendered toy not for you YOU are the one perpetuating this view, not the toy maker, not the vendor. If your kid is embarrassed and says Thats a toy for babies, thats a toy for x-gender not me then they may have picked this notion up from peers. This is a great time to have a discussion with them in the formative years as their parent. What makes you think this isnt meant for you? I wont buy it if you dont want it, but if you do want and are just worried youll get judged I think we should get it... \n\nIsnt what is put to market driven by the consumer?

In regular restaurants, I usually leave a 5% tip and it ends up being way cheaper than a no tip restaurants. IMO no tip restaurants are useless. Restaurants should just pay the waitstaff like $7.25/hour and actually eat the up the price of paying their employees instead of passing it on the customers. We came for the food not to pay your waitstaff. Charge customers like 10% markup on the cost of ingredients and keep 5% and give the rest of the 5% to staff.

        "selftext": "Social media like Facebook and Reddit allow people to live inside of echo chambers that never challenge their assumptions. And that's sad. People should always strive to be consistent. \n\nI'll start with religion because that's an easy one. If I say my beliefs are true and yours are false, I need a consistent way to make that claim. So if I say my beliefs are true because s super old book says so, then I cannot dismiss other super old books that say other religions are true. Either they're all true or they're not. \n\nOr there's another objective factor, like a specific prophet is mentioned in my book, and that's why it's true.  But then you have to compare that prophet to all the other prophets, and again unless there is some specific objective thing that makes one prophet right and all the others wrong, then you have to view them all the same.\n\nIn the real world, I left Jehovah's Witnesses because I realized their claims were no more or less valid than any other religion. Every religion says we are the true one because the Bible says XYZ here and that applies to our correct understanding. But since every Christian religion makes similar claims about the Bible, and there's no objective way to validate any of those claims, either they all have to be true or they all have to be false. \n\nFor a much more complex take, let's talk about pedophiles. If a teacher has sex with a minor student, that's rape and the teacher is a pedophile. Some people seem to think it's less severe if a female teacher has sex with a male student, and that's simply not true right? It's inconsistent to say the gender of the rapist and victim matter. There is no objective measure that makes one worse. \n\nOf course this doesn't apply to all gender and sexuality issues. Some people try to claim that feminism falls under the umbrella of being inconsistent. However we can objectively look at how horrible women were treated throughout history, and often still are treated, and come to the conclusion that yes feminism is an objective good. Hell, there are still a disgusting amount of people who still think women don't deserve control over their own bodies. In an ideal world we wouldn't need to fight for women to have equality, and when that day comes it won't be needed any more.  \n\nIt's very difficult to objectively look for consistency, but it's absolutely vital.",

        "selftext": "Preface: This opinion is not based on any real data, it is formed through my life experience and what I have seen. \n\nI'm a young adult living and working in California, used to be a hardcore weed smoker (everyday, including frequent dabbing) in high school. I stopped smoking habitually in college. I still smoke occasionally, but just a few hits off a joint about once every 2-3 months. \n\nOnce I stopped smoking weed everyday, my overall life improved. I got significantly better grades, I was more social, I exercised more and ate better, and had more motivation. \n\nI saw my friends who continued to smoke habitually struggle with things and not even consider that weed could be a factor. They would struggle with grades, with handling responsibility, or wishing their social life was more fulfilling, etc, but wouldn't connect the dots. \n\nA specific example is a girl I knew who wanted to be a lawyer. She was studying hard for the LSAT, but also was a habitual smoker who would get stoned 3 times a day. She would smoke before studying. She kept getting low scores on her practice tests, was disappointed, and thought she wasn't smart enough. I tried to suggest that maybe studying stoned is not the best practice for retaining information and she was convinced that it was other factors.\n\nOn to my actual view, I believe that people should treat weed like a drug that actually has adverse effects. Getting stoned everyday should not be normalized, just like drinking everyday is viewed as harmful. It seems like all the people I have met who habitually smoke do not think it is a problem at all.\n\nI support the legalization of weed. I think it can benefit a lot of people medically and can just plain be a fun time. If you have some medical issue or depression and smoking every day helps, all power to you.  But can we please, as a culture, stop acting like someone who gets high everyday doesn't have a drug problem?",

Im not talking so much about the mom to go in and yell at their students teachers for bad grades, but more loosely speaking about the culture that says that children are unable to think on their own and parents must do it for them. Consider the following scenarios\n\n1) your 10-year-old kid is going to play at his friends house a few blocks away. Most parents will call or text the friends mom, check and see if its OK, coordinate both schedules, arrange a time, and drive their kid over. Some parents might let their kid walk or ride their bike, but at least they will text the friends parents and let them know their kid is on the way over. \n\n2) by the sixth grade seemingly every other kid has a cell phone, for security. That way they can call mom and dad and time they encounter a difficulty of any kind.\n\n3) most parents view it as their personal responsibility to take charge of their kids social calendar, play dates, practices, games, etc. they not only drive their kid every baseball practice but they stay there and watch the whole thing. \n\nBy themselves these things seem somewhat harmless and meaningless, but the sum total of a lifetime of such decisions is that kids are completely unable to think for themselves. Flat tire, call mom and dad. Change in enrollment at school, call mom and dad. Forgot something at home, call mom and dad. At what point are we as a society going to expect children to be able to think on their own? When I was a kid it was 18. I moved out, went off to college, and was expected to call once a week. I remember being a teenager and having dead batteries, running out of gas, flat tires, breakdowns, etc. I didnt call mom and dad, what were they going to do about it? \n\nAll of this is uniquely American as well, kids Ive talked to in other countries dont have this experience at all.\n\nDont get me wrong, its good we have cell phones. I dont want anybodys kids to be in a bad situation or do something unsafe. But at some point theyre going to have to figure out how to do things on their own.

        "selftext": "The concept of \"gender\" is a social construct, an imaginary concept, a conceptual tool we use. Different of \"sex\", which describe something that \"actually exists\".\n\"Gender\" is an unnecessary and harmful concept. And worse, \"gender\" is an outdated byproduct of sexism, of times when morphological differences of sexes were relevant in most social roles.\nI know most people today still agree with the applicability of the term \"gender\", well, all these people are sexists. Perhaps our culture is so deeply sexist, we can be sexists even trying not to be.\n\nIf a man decides to wear a skirt and use lipstick (which are nowadays regarded as usually feminine behavior) he totally can, and should be respected and loved like anyone else.\nHe should also be encouraged to do as he feels like. But he is not a woman, biologically. He is just a human doing his things. \nIf somehow his sex is relevant in some situation (which is a bit weird), well, then you can refer to that human as a biological male.\nBeyond biological, that human has no other kind of sex, or actually \"gender\", as a sexist would refer to.\n\nSexism is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender, but sexism is also the reinforcement of social roles for each sex.\nFor example, harassing man for wearing a skirt and lipstick (i.e. for not fitting the masculine traditional social role). That's sexist.\n\nI wont get into intersex people, i mean chromosomal abnormalities are a different problem. And note that chromosomal abnormalities don't get to deconstruct the entire understanding of sexual dimorphism, or the concepts related to sexual and asexual reproduction of species.\n\nSure, social gender roles have been constructed as a consequence of biological sexual dimorphism during human history. \nI mean, we categorize humans and other animals into different rough clusters based on what genitals, hormones, chromosomes, or secondary sex characteristic they have. And we called it \"sex\". And that's a fine categorization, quite handy when dealing with health and reproduction mainly.\nBut that should very hardly be of any relevance to any social circumstance for a human.\n\nSocially speaking theres not a single thing, like a behavior, or some particular clothing, a profession, a circumstance, etc. thats inherently feminine or masculine.(unless for direct biological interference OR UNLESS YOU ARE A SEXIST BIGGOT)\n\n\nSo i believe that we cannot construct a gender concept outside of biological sex, unless with some sexist argument.\nBecause we will need to regard some behavior or circumstance as being masculine or feminine. But thats sexist.\n\nI would guess most of us grew up in very sexist societies (in the sense we are taught that each sex have distinct social roles)\nSometimes its just plain hard to make the thought experiment of considering things without that sexist filter.\nIt's so hard, some people just cannot see around that fiction of \"social gender\" and end up suffering if they do not perceive themselves as fitting the expected gender role.\nSo some people naively try to make up \"new genders\", or \"switch\" their gender to what fits them better. I mean, the intention is good, the intention is to make people feel better. But these unfortunate people just didn't have enough strength to see beyond their own sexist prejudices and realize that there are no genders, and therefore they don't need to fit in one.\n\nThey could be white, black, men, Japanese, women, Latino, or have whatever other phenotypic expression that has a name for it, and still, there would be no such thing as \"an adequate behavior to match your phenotypic expression\".\n\nTherefore, transgenderism, and binary or non-binary genders are a fictional role play, a weird byproduct of sexism and good intention.",

        "title": "CMV: The electoral college should be abolished.",
        "selftext": "I believe that the electoral college is unfair, undemocratic and problematic, and I believe it should be replaced with a proportional representation system or at least be changed so that all states operate like Maine and Nebraska. I personally believe that this is common sense and that the abolishment of the electoral college should be bipartisan for the following reasons.\n\n1. It's undemocratic. This is probably the most popular argument; People like Donald Trump have won presidencies without a majority in popular votes and therefore means that the president might not actually be who the people want. A popular counter-argument is the prevention of \"The tyranny of the Majority\". The problem with this argument is that with the electoral college, in order to prevent \"The Tyranny of the Majority\", it creates something probably worse, which is \"The Tyranny of the Minority\". I'd rather a president who only represents 51% of the population than one that only represents 49%. \n2. One big argument for the electoral college is that it gives the small states a voice. I believe this to be only partially true. Yes, it does give states such as Wyoming a stronger voice. However, it dismisses two problems. The first is that it gives smaller states a voice at the cost of reducing the voting power of big states. In order to have a fair, democratic election, everyone must have the same voting power. However, the electoral college means that it gives significantly more voting power to a person in say Wyoming compared to a person in California or Texas. The second problem is that the electoral college actually removes small states or solid red or blue states from the race. Candidates often will only care about swing states such as Pennsylvania or Florida. Now, obviously even in a popular vote system candidates will most likely priorities these states. However, a popular vote would mean that there would actually be an upside to a Republican visiting California or a Democrat visiting Texas.\n3. There is a significantly higher possibility of a draw. In fact, it has happened before and is perfectly plausible that it happens again. If a draw happens the winner of the election is up to the congress, which to me, doesn't sound very democratic. (I'm not saying that a draw can't happen in a popular vote, it's just significantly less likely that it does happen.)\n4. It reinforces the two-party system. A third-party candidate could win more than 20% of the popular vote, and not even get a single electoral vote (despite it being mathematically possible to win the election with only 23% of the popular vote). This means that if you're a third-party candidate, you might as well just not run. I also believe that the fact that third parties are virtually non-existent in this system is probably why Joe Manchin and AOC represent the same party and is partially why American politics has become so polarising. Furthermore, as seen in past elections, the two-party system forces people to vote for the \"lesser evil\", not the person with who they most agree. (Obviously, you could vote for a third party, it's just that they almost definitely won't even make an impact on the outcome of the election.)\n\nI find it ironic that despite the fact that \"all men are created equal\", people in the US don't have equal voting power. Someone can win 51% of the vote lose the election, and yet if someone wins 51% of the vote in a state, they take all of the electoral votes in a state. The electoral college is full of inconsistencies and contradictions, and so I believe it is about time that the US replaces this outdated, undemocratic voting system. Change my view.",

Regular sting operations put a very strong incentive for harassers to stop, since they is now a risk that a woman walking alone or only with other women, is actually a police officer with a taser. Women will also over time feel safer telling a stranger to leave them alone, since it will be recognised that being told to leave is a part of the sting operations.\n\nThese sting operations won't count as entrapment, since the officers aren't taking any actions that would cause a reasonable person to become violent. \n\nI recognise this wouldn't be a silver bullet to nighttime harassment, but I believe it would have a significant affect.\n\nDisclaimer: Men also face sexual harassment.

The exhibit displayed real human corpses which had been carefully preserved to be dynamic and display the complex human biological systems in the flesh. One piece stuck out to me in particular; someone had carefully and painstaking extracted an entire central nervous system. That image is burned into my head complete with the stirring realization that contained within the nervous system is our entire existence; all of our memories and thoughts and feelings and experiences and expectations. \n\nI hear advocates for gender reassignment surgery claim they feel trapped in their body or that theyve never felt comfortable in their own skin because of a discrepancy between what they think and feel about themselves versus what they see and touch on themselves. However if we know that gender is clearly a social construct, we then can assume that being trapped in your body is a social-psychological dilemma as opposed to a concrete physiological problem. \n\n I have mounds of compassion and patience for those who feel reassignment is necessary, but I think the solution is to cultivate a social environment that doesnt bring the expectations surrounding binary gender framework rather than an elective surgery which doesnt guarantee long term happiness or health. \n\nIn other words, the perception and expectations regarding gender reassignment and the knowledge of gender as a social construct are contradictory and even paradoxical.

        "selftext": "The New Deal offered an unprecedented change for the working class in America and was broadly popular.  The classes that opposed it were so out of favor that they could only symbolically argue against it.  However as time passed and their political power grew, they set about dismantling it, first around the edges, and later in large pieces.  Now, very little of the New Deal is still law in the US.\n\nThis is the problem with trying to regulate changes in law that readjust the operating parameters of the economy: you leave behind the base of the power of the class that seeks to gain at the expense of the workers.  They still own the businesses.  They still have most of the money.  Power is the ability to act and nothing gives a person more ability to act than money; thus, money *is* power.  As long as they hold the keys to making money and the money itself, they will have the power in the long term.  No matter how politically unpopular it may be in a moment in time, they can wait it out and use their power later to undermine any legal changes made that might impede their interests.\n\nIf there is to be any long term change towards more equality, less poverty, etc, the ownership of businesses needs to move from the 1% to the people that actually do the work.  I think the fairest way to do this is to tweak a proposal that circulated the UK labor party under Corbyn.  \n\nAny time an owner of a business, in whole or in part, attempts to sell their stake or dies, the workers have the right of first refusal to collectively purchase the stake from the seller or the estate, at fair market value, via a 0% loan from the Fed (or central bank).\n\nFunctionally, the workers would collectively decide via a simple majority of signatures to initiate a buyout via the fed.  The fed would set up an account with the full value of the company, maybe even in T-bonds, as the buyout could take a generation.  As sell orders for stocks are posted, the fed would pay the going rate on those stocks (a mechanism to pause the value of the stock would be useful here).  As owners of shares died, the process of handing over the inheritance to the heirs would include converting those shares that have been earmarked for co-operative ownership to cash.  In this way, over the course of a few generations, the right of ownership, without the expropriation of value could transfer to the broad base of society.  The profits of these industries would be negotiated to pay back the loan to the fed, while leaving the possibility of retaining some earnings for growth.\n\nSo, what would be the benefit of this?  Firstly, it would shift incomes drastically away from the 1% and to the working class.  Median incomes would soar and average incomes would remain relatively unchanged, thus the skew that defines inequality would shrink.  Businesses woukd become democratically run.  Decisions about what to produce, how to produce it, what to do with the profits, management pay (8 times the avg pay vs 3000 times), whether to outsource, what the working day is, etc would be decided by the people it affects most.  If a machine were to be invented that makes half the labor force at a company obsolete were to be invented, it seems unlikely that half of them woukd vote themselves out of the company, but instead they collectively would decide to all take the same pay and work half as much. \n\nOwnership also brings a culture of ownership.  No longer are you working for somebody else.  Slaving away at a low wage so they may take home buckets of unearned cash.  The better your company does, the more you will make.  This has a profound effect on attitudes, quality of work, and accountability.\n\nMeanwhile, the wealth of the old ownership class would be split into smaller and smaller slices with each generation. The power of the ownership class would dwindle without the ownership of industry behind it, fueling the political ads and propaganda that confuse and divide people.  Governments could exacerbate this by taxing wealth, further reducing their power.  \n\nImportantly, a structure like this doesn't prevent entrepreneurship.  Anyone could still take a good idea and run with it (likely, they would have a hell of a lot more money to fund their idea too), it's just that if they decide to sell the business or die, if the workers have collectively decided to own the business, the owner would either have to sell it to the workers or only pass the value of the business to their heirs, not the ownership.  It's also important to recognize that all of this happens without forcing anybody to do anything.  You don't have to sell your stake and if you do, you don't really care who buys it.  The workers don't have to buy it either, they simply get the right of first refusal.  And if you're dead, it's not your problem anymore.\n\nSo, exactly how much would wages increase under this arrangement?  That is partially decided by how much of the earnings a company retains, but we can look at a few examples.  Let's start with the usual suspects:\n\nMcDonald's:  MCD common stock has 745.6M outstanding shares.  They pay $5.16 per share in dividends.  That's $3.847B in total dividends.  They have 210,000 employees.  Ignoring dividends on preferred shares (if any), C-suite pay and leaving the business otherwise unchanged, they could pay every employee an additional $18,320 per year or about $8.81 an hour more. \n\nWalmart: has 2.8B shares earning 4.74/share.  It could pay its workers an additional 6k.  Walmart net margins are incredibly small, usually sub 5%\n\nAmazon: has 1M employees and made 21.33B, so they could pay every employee 21,330 more per year.\n\nAT&amp;T: pays out 14.768B in dividends and has 230k employees.  It could pay every worker an additional 64,208 or 30.87 more per hour.\n\nAmeriprise: has 2722 employees and pays out 485.89M in dividends.  It could pay each employee an additional 178,504k or 85.82 an hour more.\n\nWe could go on, but you get the point.  The vast majority of all of this money is going instead to the upper 1% of society.  This is why we can't have nice things. \n\nBy changing the ownership structure, we could broadly benefit society in many many ways, including many I did not list here.  It seems pretty water tight to me, but if you can, change my view.",

        "title": "CMV: I don't understand the concept of being nonbinary.",
        "selftext": "I have a ton to say on this topic so its probably going to be an unorganized clusterfuck. Also, please read the whole post before you reply. \n\nFirst, I want to say I dont hate anyone who considers themself nonbinary. I simply just dont understand them. I get being gay/lesbian. I get that, but its the trans and nonbinaries which really just kinda hurt my brain to think about. Now, I am a cis white male, lets get that out of the way. So its probably impossible for me to understand what it feels like to want to identify as a trans or nonbinary. Ive seen people try to describe it, but whenever they do, I just cannot make sense of it. Nonbinary means that someone was born as a guy, but considers themself a girl. or something like that. But WHY? Why do you feel this way? Humans naturally want to understand everything, so Im really trying to figure this out. Why would someone not want to identify with the gender they were born with? Im perfectly happy with mine, but why do some people feel otherwise? This is my problem with the trans/nonbinaries. I cant comprehend why someone would feel this way. Theyre not stupid or mentally deficient. Theyre not handicapped. They just THINK. \n\nSo first, we need to know exactly what nonbinary is. So according to transequality.org, non-binary is one term people use to describe genders that dont fall into one of these two categories, male or female.\nThis is what I dont understand. There are only two genders, this is a proven scientific fact. But it is possible for a mutation to occur that causes one to not be either gender, which I believe is intersex. So then what is nonbinary? \n\nHeres a quote I found: When asked about my own gender, I often repeat something Ive heard said by gender nonconforming and non-binary people: I am me-gender. I am simply myself, despite any parts I may have been born with. \nThis makes no sense. There are only two genders. You can identify with whatever you want. You can call yourself an attack helicopter, but that doesnt change the fact that you were born either male or female. Or intersex if something wrong happened. Again, apologies if I come across as an ass, Im just having a real rough time here. Ive been pondering this for a long fucking time. But you know, it is possible to not be offended by everything. And if I say a pronoun incorrectly, its not my fault. How am I supposed to know what you want to be called? If I walk up to someone who looks like a girl and address them as a girl, and they get mad, why should I be ridiculed?\n\nAnyway, I hear some nonbinaries say, I was named a girl when I was born, but when I got older, I was deeply uncomfortable when people addressed me as a girl. But WHY? Why does that make you uncomfortable? Is there something wrong with them? Are they mentally handicapped or something? Probably not, I dont know. Id love for someone to be able to explain it to me and actually get me to understand, but Ill warn you now, its gonna be FUCKING hard.\n\nAnother thing I need to bring up is calling yourself nonbinary/trans for clout and sympathy. The internet brings out the worst in people. Theyll do anything for clout and sympathy, and that includes calling themselves trans/nonbinary. Either because they love the attention and sympathy it brings them, or because they are jumping on the bandwagon. On twitter especially, this is a concern. This leads me to believe that trans/nonbinary people are much less common than I previously thought. (I know I said in the title that it was just nonbinary, but I kinda feel the same about trans people as well.) \n\nBut yeah, I think thats everything I wanted to touch on. I might edit this later if I remember more or if someone actually manages to change my view. Again, I dont hate any of the people I mentioned, (except of course the people using the terms for clout and attention) so dont get mad at me. Im only stating how I personally feel on the matter. It is in fact possible to not get offended by anything at all, believe it or not. If youre going to make a long reply to me, please space out your paragraphs so its easier to read. One huge mile-long solid brick of text hurts to look at.\n\nAlso, this is sort of unrelated, but Im going to pronounce LGBT as Lig-bit until you change your communtiy name, becuase L G B T Q + is a fucking mouthful and you know it.",

        "selftext": "I generally dislike Ben Shapiro, but one argument he consistently makes that Im having a hard time finding arguments against is that welfare incentivizes single-parenthood over creating a cohesive family unit, discourages these individuals from getting employed, especially in the bluest states, because they can make upwards of $50k/year with a kid between food stamps, cell phones, etc.\n\nIs this just an acceptable flaw with welfare? I do believe that welfare serves an important purpose - it protects the innocent children - but how do you create a system that incentivizes people to get off welfare instead of staying on it? Every conservative person I know has a story about someone they know who is lazy and lives off the government and turns down employment when offered. That means the welfare state doesnt work. It encourages people to stay on it.\n\nSo please change my view - I believe the welfare state, while necessary, ultimately harms our federal and states finances because of the disincentive to leave welfare, to create a cohesive family unit and to find employment. The economic benefit of these dollars outweighs the cost of obtaining them in the first place - average taxes are 20-28%, but each dollar of welfare only creates $2 of economic activity supposedly.... which means it doesnt pay for itself at all. So, are there good arguments that support the notion that welfare is meant to be temporary or designed as such? That welfare can be sustainable because it can be net zero for the broader economy?",

If there were no sharks, other animals like dolphins, predatory fish, etc. would simply take over the title of apex predator and keep those populations in check. Or, humans could expand fishing rights or methods to harvest more fish.\n\n2) New Zealand has a goal to become predator free by 2050, so they dont seem worried about an ecosystem collapse.\n\n3) Apex predator populations weed out the sick and weak and keep their populations in check through competition for food and mates. Presumably, non-predator species would do the same over time if predatory pressures were removed.\n\n4) Apex predators like the Saber Tooth Tiger have gone extinct without any noticeable ecosystem collapse.\n\n5) The studies Ive seen around decreasing predation highlight short term effects, like a reduction in grassland, but dont seem to study the effects after multiple generations or the effects of human intervention.\n\nSure, ecosystems would change, some significantly, but I dont see how ecosystems would collapse if dominant apex predators went extinct.",

        "title": "CMV: To overcome extreme political polarization (and the filibuster), the \"For the People Act\" should let Americans vote for multiple candidates at a time.",
        "selftext": "The \"For the People\" bill currently in Congress contains many improvements to the US election process: expanding voting rights, reducing the influence of money in politics and especially limits on partisan gerrymandering. But the Senate filibuster presents a huge hurdle for it to become law.\n\nHowever, there is an opportunity to attack another root cause of political polarization. The \"For the People Act\" should allow voters to express on opinion on every candidate, not just one. Not only could this instantly kill the extreme polarization of US politics. It could also turn the For-the-People-Act from a partisan Democratic party project into a life-saver for centrist Republicans--potentially ten to help overcome the filibuster.\n\nIf Congress allowed every voter to express their opinion about every candidate, voting \"for A\" would not necessarily mean voting \"against B\". This provision would remove the incentive for negative campaigning. Candidates would compete *for* voter support, not *against* each other. \n\nIt would also strengthen democracy because voters could express a range of views, rather than be counted as a party supporter just because they hated the other party a bit more. And it would allow candidates more flexibility in straying from their party line, or even creating new parties, adding more nuance to political debate than the never-ending red-against-blue doom loop.\n\nBut if people had multiple votes, who would win? This would be for states to decide. Voting theory has come up with many alternative systems: simply sum up all the totals (approval voting), ask voters to rank candidates in order (Ranked-choice voting), or even to grade every candidate on a scale (range methods). Voting theorists vehemently disagree which method is better. But they all agree that the current system is terrible and that voters should express preferences about several candidates, especially if the US sticks to single-member districts.\n\nCongress has the power to regulate federal elections, but the US also has a strong tradition of states determining the execution within that framework. In line with that, Congress could legislate just the least common denominator of all better voting methods, by granting voters the right to multiple votes. States could then decide individually which voting method would work best for their local circumstances. Some have already implemented RCV, some might prefer approval voting, others might want to try out a ranked method. But by granting each voter multiple votes by law, Congress would ensure that the current method (simple plurality based on single votes) can no longer be used.\n\nNormally, elected politicians have no incentive to change the current plurality system. But now that the Republican party is at war with its moderate candidates, these moderate candidates could see one-voter-multiple-votes as their lifeline to survive. If elections gave third candidates a real chance, moderate Republicans could run next to Trumpist candidates or even decide to form their own party. And on the left, independents like Bernie Sanders and leftists like AOC might prefer to have their own party too.\n\nBut more importantly, it would end the extreme polarization between just two parties. There is no way we can \"unite\" America again without politicians who can walk a \"third way\" between the two big parties. Giving every voter multiple votes would show the existing support for alternative views, while giving a lifeline to politicians who could be open to reducing the polarization themselves.\n\nNote: this CMV based on original points and new insights gained from https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ltzaod/cmv_to_get_centrist_republicans_support_hr1/",

Honestly, I have no idea how they could possibly argue that their lives conform to Jesus' teachings about values. If one were to intuit what Christianity is about by collecting data on Christian conservative behavior, socio-political beliefs, and leadership, one would have an extremely warped interpretation of what Christianity is about, and it certainly would not reflect the essence of the teachings. \n\nBy contrast, the following is how Jesus described pharisees, copied from [this article](http://www.theendofhistory.net/important_stories_christians_need_to_know/modern-day-pharisees-christian-conservatives/), which pulls them from the book of Matthew (the verse number follows each bulletpoint):\n\n* They dont practice what they preach (v. 3)\n* They overburden the people but do not assist with those spiritual burdens (v. 4)\n* Their spiritual experience and lifestyle is all a performance to be seen by others (v. 5)\n* They are overly invested in being honored and esteemed socially (v. 6-7)\n* Their behavior contradicts the values of the Kingdom of God (v. 8-12)\n* They block the pathway for the people to enter the Kingdom of God (v. 13)\n* They create a culture and following of religious hypocrites (v. 15)\n* They place greater importance upon wealth and power than upon God and spiritual realities (v. 16-22)\n* They maintain legalistic standards of faith but violate the basic values of the faith (v. 23-24)\n* They focus upon external appearances but are internally corrupt (v. 25-28)\n* They repeat the mistake of prior generations in destroying and corrupting truth that God wants given to the people (v. 29-32)\n* Their activity and presence has brought a curse upon the people (v. 33-39)\n\nI could go into detail about each of those bulletpoints, but the examples are so self-evident as to not warrant comment-- except the last one, where widespread anti-masking behavior by Christian conservatives unfortunately has exacerbated a pandemic that has now killed 500,000 people.\n\nSome Christians respond to their general lack of concern about poverty, hunger, and joblessness by resorting to the parable about \"teaching a man to fish.\" Unfortunately, they aren't too interested in promoting education either, as evidenced by years and years of anti-education initiatives and anti-teacher politics.  So that's out the window too.\n\nI also want to preemptively brush aside whataboutism claims, primarily because those \"other people\" don't talk about Christianity all the time. It is the duty of self-proclaimed Christians to live up to those values, not for others to adhere to Christian values.  \n\nChange my view. How do Christian conservatives resemble Jesus or his teachings more than they resemble the pharisees?",

        "title": "CMV: How much does Gender matter and is the debate about genders even relevant to society? As in, if it gets resolved well, it will further society in a good way.",
        "selftext": "TL;DR at the end, I was rambling somewhat.\n\nPlease do not take me not answering quickly as disinterest or as anything similar. I may or may not fall asleep waiting for answers, but I will definitely answer before 10 hours have passed maybe even before 5 if I do fall asleep. Thanks\n\nDoes gender even matter?\n\nMost of the debate about genders seems to be about trans people. With a 40% suicide rate and extreme frequency of other mental illnesses among them, it is clear to everyone who does not want to start an arguement with this that people who wish to change gender actually really should get mental help before an operation to change their sex is done.\n\nThis shows, in my view, that this is more a misguided social debate than anything else. People want outrage, they want to feel morally superior etc., which is why the gender debate got so big and continues endlessly. Others fanning the flames and stuff don't make it easier to take a step back and look at the whole picture.\n\nWe have two sexes, and different societies hold different expectations for them. Just because you defy those expectations or do not like them, does in no way make you special or warrants people to suddenly throw those expectations aside and treat you like you want to be treated.\n\nAfter all, we are all humans, most of us are even more or less on the same cognitive level, and most of us know to respect one another. Why would someone who does not have a mental illness or is in a special situation anyway suddenly suffer from general expectations \"society\" has for 'half the population' and decide to make it their identity to be different from the norm and wanting special privileges?\n\nI do understand not fitting in with the crowd, but since at least fifty years, most of the western society has been very accomodating and accepting of people who did not match the norm and has steadily become even more so.\n\nWhat I see in the gender debate is an inflated and selfmade (a huge thanks to the media and sjws) problem that is the result of people trying to see the limits of how far they can push inclusivity, minority protection (at the cost of the majority), acceptance and dictation of new rules on no basis.\n\nOf course, a huge part of the gender debate is based on the change of how women and people of colour are and should be treated in society. But is there really a good goal to fight for in the debate about multiple genders? What could it be?\n\nTo never dare address someone by Mister or Miss, even if they look like that, because there is an incredibly small chance of a mentally ill trans person getting ptsd from it if we guessed their sex wrong? To make it seem normal to suffer to great extents from social norms? To encourage all children to be like those trans people because then they will finally get more attention?\n\nI do not see a single worthy goal. \n\nEqual rights for all! That is something nearly anybody can get behind and support, and it is the fight for this that continually changed our society the past decades. In my opinion, this fight was already very successful even if it is still going on, though with less target-orientedness, purpose and specificness.\n\nThere is no opportunity that mainly and directly excludes someone based on their sex or ethnicity. The people that do so regardless of the are usually punished and protection of those formerly disadvantaged has even reached the point where there is overcorrecting, creating unequal opportunities in favour of those groups of people formerly disadvantaged. I have no big issue with that, as long as it does not go too far and evens out in some years.\n\nNow, the main inequality I see is between the poor and the rich. According to studies, according to the news, the poor are more likely to remain poor and the rich are more likely to remain rich and even get richer.\n\nBack to the topic of genders. In my view, not including the aberrant cases of birth deformities, there are two sexes. Genders are a lingual invention based on the sexes and what society expects of them. Women have fought for some time by now (idk how many decades) to change society's perception of them and to get equal rights to men. Now that they do, the fight and movement still has not stopped, instead losing a good amount of support and instead going for more rights, instead of equal rights.\n\nThis has swapped over to other communities, including the transsexual people.\n\nInstead of fighting for equal rights and opportunities, the fight over genders is for more, special extra rights or changes for the benefit of extreme minorities. \n\nThis whole post is not even going into how bad it could be to glorify lgbtq to kids could be, as they won't get a normal view if the lgbtq attention and regard far trumps normal points of view in the media.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis CMV is mostly me putting some of my thoughts into words late at night and while I do not see anything straight out wrong with them, please do try to change my view(s) if you do not completely agree with them. Please try to challenge more my general views than specific sentences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I do not see a good point in the gender debate as in my opinion most people who \"identify\" as something other than human are mentally ill or have mental problems that they need to work through. Granting people special privileges based on that is nonsensical as is the discussion about changing languages and communication for this minority with the help of the government/media.",

I simply don't fully understand or believe in the legitimacy of transgenderism as a concept, and would be genuinely fascinated to hear the perspectives of others.\n\nAs the title says, I simply don't really understand or believe in the idea of being transgender. Maybe I'm missing a key part of what it is to be transgender, but to me defining yourself as a different gender is something people do for 2 reasons: being uncomfortable either in a behavioral or physical sense. Let me explain.\n\nBehaviorally, people want to change gender or be nonbinary etc. because they simply think that the way they act doesn't fit their current sex. To me, this is utter crap. This is just people falling into the trap of gender stereotypes, and then feeling uncomfortable because the way they act doesn't align with how society thinks of them. To me, a guy who thinks he's a girl is just a feminine male. It doesn't matter if he feels more comfortable in women's clothing, that's simply a mental connection he's made based off of gender stereotypes. As gay men, we don't consider ourselves women because we like dick, yet many people think they aren't a man or woman simply because they don't conform to their socially-defined sense of gender normalcy.\n\nPhysically, transgenderism simply fails to convince me on a conceptual level. We all want physical traits that we don't have. Many of us want to be taller, stronger, and more attractive. Maybe a gay bottom kind of wants a vagina for how convenient the cleanup is, but that doesn't make him a woman. If somebody feels like they would enjoy the feeling of having boobs or having a penis, I don't understand why the sexual nature of that desire makes it any more serious or legitimate then an individual who wishes he didn't have a bad back. \n\nHonestly, I would love for someone to prove me wrong. I would genuinely enjoy to learn more about a vulnerable community of people who are currently under attack more than any other part of the LGBT movement. What I don't want is for people to get angry, yell at me for just \"not getting it\", and to provide an argument based solely in personal experience and how they \"feel\" about it. I hope there are some solid, conceptual and evidence-based arguments that debunk how I currently feel about transgenderism, especially considering that one of my friends is going through a self-proclaimed gender crisis.

I have someone I consider a best friend and I am 99.9% sure he considers me his best friend since we go way back. A few years ago I didn't have this belief and considered someone else my best friend but this time it wasn't mutual. This friend considered me as one of his good friends while I considered him my best friend. It didn't bug me that much but now that I think about it, it seems too awkward and in a way one sided. Imagine if you told someone that you considered them your best friend and the person responded by saying \"You're a good friend but I have someone better.\" Perhaps this analogy is blunt but it is basically what a non mutual best friendship is. It is similar to dating, if your significant other isn't your \"best friend\", why are you dating them. They will just leave you for someone they find better. The way I define \"best friends\" is 2 people who have an unbroken bond and wouldn't abandon the other. 2 people who can potentially be classified as inseparable. You can have your own friend groups and your best friend can have their own friend groups but when they think about who their best friend is, it should be mutual. Anything else is \"one sided\" in my opinion. You can still be good friends with someone who doesn't consider you their best friend but all it will do is hurt you deep down.",

This blind faith and support is an issue, as it allows candidates who are incompetent to have success. Not only that, but it also makes the government less affective as the politicians belonging to a party generally have to act within the party's accepted ideals, which does not allow for change at a sufficiently quick rate. Furthermore, it creates a climate where politicians are unable to achieve as much as they are divided among party lines, and even worse, often disconnects the country along sectional lines, for in certain periods the US has voted for parties based on geography.

        "selftext": "The traditional view is that a citizenship is not a commodity nor a security. It seems that a citizenship has a certain \"sacred\" position in people's minds. People think you shouldn't get to be part of a country just because you bought the membership on the market. They think belonging to a country is something you shouldn't be able to just buy or trade away. But a citizenship isn't that special, it's just a glorified membership. It can be considered even less than that in some aspects.\n\nThe idea of having a market and a market price for citizenship, or fractions of a citizenship, may seem absurd to some people. But I will make a few points for you to consider. If these points have flaws in them that I have overlooked, then please let me know so I can thank you.\n\nPoint 1: if you leave a country for good, then your citizenship has little value to you, or even negative value, so being able to just put your now-useless citizenship on the market would not just benefit you due to the cash you would receive from someone else buying your citizenship off of you, but the buyer would also get the citizenship and may now move into the country you left and fill the whole you left. Otherwise, your citizenship would just be wasted away unused. So a tradeable citizenship facilitates freedom of movement financially for the emigrants, and facilitates freedom of movement legally for the immigrant. \n\nPoint 2: the dynamic market price associated with the citizenship, or its corresponding fractional shares, would be an important measure of the performance of the country issuing that citizenship. The better a country performs, economically, socially, politically, etc, then the higher the market price will rise. This also has the benefit of increasing the wealth valuation of every citizenship holder. If the country's citizenship rises to a million dollars, then that's a cause for celebration because now that country's citizens can afford more imports just purely from the amount of wealth in that country.\n\nI have other points but that should be good for now. Please help me understand the weaknesses of such a system. I think we're moving towards this system anyway so it's good for others to familiarize themselves with such a concept ahead of time.",

I get enough texts anyways, that I get back to people in like an hour or so usually, and often a lot faster. I check my phone when I feel like it, instead of when my phone decides. Having the sound on isn't even good for your mental state anyway, or your fucking sleep apparently. *Use vibrate if anything I guess, that makes a billion times more sense.* What kind of texts are you getting where you're gonna be burned not replying in 1m? Billion dollar business deals? Who do you even know that needs such a super quick response? It's literally just tech addiction.\n\nIf **you** wanted my attention really badly for something quickly, would you text me or call me? If you were waiting outside my building to come inside, would you text me or call me? If you had anything important to tell me that was time sensitive, would you text me or call me? If you answered 'call me' to all 3 of those questions, congrats! There is hope for you\n\nIt's called a ringer. That's my version of 'ding'. Ringer = holy fuck I need your attention. Text = casual, non life-threatening chat where there's not urgent up-to-the-minute fuck-giving at hand. If there's ever a situation where I'm anticipating some contact I don't want to miss, I tell people to call me. My ringer is always on. (I turn it off when I sleep cause I'm not fuckwitted lol, cause I have friends that are known night owls and so am I sometimes).\n\nIt actually is a bit of a failure from the device manufacturers if you think about it: they should have a setting where you can tell the phone when you usually sleep, so that your ringer and sounds are all off late at night. Pretty big, big miss not having that feature if you ask me... 'Silent Night' button. 11pm - 11am. Not rocket surgery",

I grew up under the poverty line, meaning 80% or so of African American children are from wealthier families than I, so his arguments that immigrants experienced lateral mobility more so than blacks were far from convincing of my accountability for that size of payment. I fully support community investments, infrastructure investments, scholarships, compensation for homeowners who were victim to predatory lending or redlining, small business grants and changing the narrative of history by means of replacing statues, etc. Im into having realistic conversations about how to build true equality, Im specifically talking about the view that $2 mil  direct payments funded by citizens (because there is not way to say its coming from the government without being collected from the citizens) should go to slave descendants.

When you share cute animal photos on internet, even if they are adopted or rescued, it leads to more people wanting these cute animals as pets and most of them don't bother with sticking to getting their furry friends from animal shelters. \n\n\nThis is even worse with wild or semi-wild animals that are super cute but don't make good pets. I see this on reddit all the time. Someone shares a cute video of a wild animals and most of the comments are like, \"Damn, I didn't know I wanted a red panda as a pet so much.\" Even if you argue that most of them are joking, there's a reason that people are increasingly seeking exotic animals as pets. This leads to more demand for pets and more pain for animals forced to breed for the pet industry. \n\n\nYou can argue that social media has also raised awareness about animal shelters and this has lead to more and more people getting their pets from animal shelters. True. And yet, the absolute number of pets keep increasing and more households have pets now than ever before. \n\n\nIn a perfect world, for profit pet industry would be banned across the world and we won't have to worry about sharing cute dog and cat photos.

I think with the correct education at a young age and clear consequences, we can effectively eliminate the more insidious, pervasive kind of sexism we see throughout society as a whole. The boss who makes inappropriate comments, the groping on the dancefloor, the slut shaming, the drunk guy who doesnt take no for an answer. \n\nBut that conversation should be entirely separate from the one were having about Sarah. Whoever did this (I believe they have a suspect in custody) didnt do so because he wasnt called out for a off-colour joke in the lads group chat. He didnt do it because he didnt understand what consent was.\n\nHe did it because hes mentally deranged and was capable of taking another human beings life for his own gratification. And if we accept that these kinds of people will always exist in society, and historical precedent makes me firmly believe they will, then not only is police advice to walk in pairs prudent, its completely necessary and not, in any way, victim blaming. \n\nYes, of course its shit and unfair and completely at odds with a supposedly progressive society that we have to do this, but I think we have to treat any legislation or education as separate from these kinds of monsters.

A guy could have an ulterior motive of HAVING SEX with a girl but to think someone could have an ulterior motive to DATE you in the guise of befriending you is an oxymoron. I dont think its possible to have ulterior motives to date someone you just newly met because normally you dont having feelings for someone you just met to even have any tangible ulterior motives. You dont know anything about the person to even say that you like anything about them and an emotional connection isn't so clear until you get to know someone. Love at first sight doesnt exist and genuine feelings for someone are almost never developed instant upon seeing that person for the first time. Its possible to acknowledge before met someone that theyre physically or sexually attractive or just your type but thats not a good indicator of wether or not your going to have feelings for them. Sexual attraction is instant but romantic feelings always take time to grow. You at the very least have to know the person first. People that have the opinion that you can befriend someone with the ulterior motive of dating them later just cant grasp Romantic feelings and sexual feelings dont work the same way.\n\nYou cant choose to or plan on catching feelings for someone. Because relationships and feelings by their nature are too non-deterministic to plan out. People who think confessing your feelings is creepy are just bad at rejecting people maturely due to their own neuroticism and just have this notion that relationships are deterministic. Even if you approach relationships by being friends first and getting to know them better and find yourself catching feelings for them, its not manipulative because the feelings werent present to begin with.",

        "title": "CMV: Even if Supers started as a troll, they're still 100% valid",
        "selftext": "To ban people coming from a certain sexual orientation from speaking is the most anti-progressive thing possible and the entire LGBTQ community will suffer greatly from this controversy. Even though being attracted exclusively to people born in the opposite sex seems transphobic to some people, that does not justify anything from what is happening.\n\nFirst of all, if you support the LGBTQ community in any way, the concept of sexual orientation being something out of your control is a given; this is why using religion to justify banning homosexual relationships does not fly in today's society, and gay conversion therapy even less so. Also, the idea that sex is something that should be consensual (which I hope everyone agrees with) is also a given. Taking this into account, how could anyone demand that superstraight folks not discriminate against trans people in their sexual orientation? You either can chose who you're attracted to, in which case using religion as a justification to ban anything LGBTQ is valid, or you cannot, in which case superstraight people should be 100% free to choose who they feel attraction towards.\n\nSecond of all, people will argue that specifically excluding trans people from their dating pool is bigoted, and let me explain why that is not true. Your beliefs and your attraction are two completely different things, the first one being something within your control, while (as we've already established) the second one being outside of it. You can absolutely support gay marriage while being straight and lots of people do. You're not invalidating a gay person's sexuality by not being attracted to him. \n\nIf you're a straight lady and a lesbian flirts with you, it's not homophobic to refuse her. When you say \"no\" you're saying \"I am not attracted to you and thus do not consent to sleeping or entering a relationship with you\". What you are NOT saying is \"I don't support your right to be a lesbian\" or \"I refuse to see you as anything besides straight\". However, even if this theoretical straight woman is approached by a man, she obviously still has the right to say \"no\". Also, I think we all can agree that even justifying why you are not attracted to someone should never be necessary. If, for any reason, you do not want to sleep or enter a relationship with someone, it's 100% your right not to, even if you yourself can't specifically figure out why.\n\nNow, whichever stance you take on trans right, whether you support them or not, you probably agree with the paragraph above and the idea that nobody is owed attraction from anyone else (unless you're a rapist or an incel, but these two groups of people aren't a sizable minority anyway). If so, why would trans people be owed anything? Why is it completely acceptable to have a sexuality that excludes one of the cis genders (like homosexual or lesbian) or even both (asexual), without implying anything about your personal beliefs about other people's rights, but it's somehow considered transphobic to not be attracted or not want to date trans people? It is not about not accepting them as the gender they see themselves as. That has nothing to do with your sexuality.\n\nWhy should all of this anti-super rhetoric stop? Because it's doing immense harm to the very cause its trying to defend. Propagating the idea that people can chose to be attracted to trans folks but are deciding not to functions by the exact same logic as transphobes saying trans people can act as their assigned gender but are choosing not to, or that homosexuals can be attracted to their opposite sex but are choosing not to. If there's something I'm missing here please let me know.\n\nAnd finally, anti-super rhetoric is in extremely bad taste and is very similar to regular phobic language. If you tell a super-straight guy that maybe \"he hasn't yet seen the perfect trans woman that may attract him\" and that such a woman does exist and he shouldn't be against the idea is exactly the same as telling a gay guy \"how do you know you're not attracted to women if you haven't tried it yet?\". It's not even about your opinions on sexuality-related issues at this point, it's just indecency in my opinion. Such statements are simply rude and it's frankly none of your business what other people find attractive and they do not.",

Added to the fact that many people were killed and forcibly sterilized, you pretty much have the textbook definition of genocide.\n\nI believe this is EXACTLY what China is doing to the Uighur people. The US is not perfect by any means, but we have at least started to accept that diversity in culture is a positive thing. China wants to make its population entirely homogeneous by destroying any aspects of a culture that do not fit with their current expansionist goals. They are breaking down local governments that oppose them and imprisoning (and likely forcibly sterilizing and torturing) those that do not immediately comply.\n\nI guess some people would argue that since the US has made those mistakes and benefited from them, then we shouldnt criticize China for them. Then again, some people argue that we need to allow developing countries to pollute because they have not benefited as much from pollution in the past.

That being said, I believe that gender and ethnic quotas for jobs are a bad idea because:\n\n* Quotas try to compensate for bigotry and discrimination, but quotas doesn't don't fix these attitudes, if anything, quotas inflame them.\n\n* It is a good thing if people are willing to vote for a candidate for their policies instead of for their ethnicity or gender.\n\n* The ethnic and gender composition of Australian politicians definitely is disproportionate to the population. The way to fix this is not forcing quotas, but rather by changing attitudes both within politics (which ties into [this earlier CMV post]() of mine) and outside politics (so that minorities show more interest in politics).\n\n* If you check out r/AustralianPolitics, you will see a lot of people supporting the Coalition, and they don't care about the bad things the Coalition does, because they are more afraid of the left wing parties supporting racial quotas that will disadvantage White Australians.

The accused person isn't required to intend the resulting or potential harm, but must have acted in a way that showed a disregard for the foreseeable consequences of the actions. The charge may occur in various contexts, such as, among others, domestic cases, car accidents, construction site accidents, testing sites, domestic/child abuse situations, and hospital abuse.\n\nThere is generally an accepted scientific standard, per jurisdiction, of what counts as 'COVID-safe'. \n\nCOVID-19 is a virus capable of causing serious long-term harm or death, even to the able-bodied. \n\nTherefore, if you open a business in such a way as to break COVID-19 regulations - be that to have too many workers on a factory floor, to be open at all when you shouldn't be, to take masks off in areas where masks are mandated - you are recklessly endangering the people in that area.  \n\nThese cases are also likely to have plenty of evidence too, in the form of work rosters, payrolls, and photos of the breaches in question.\n\nI recognise that in some nations the lack of effective economic relief has forced some businesses to open in order to survive, but even though I'm sympathetic, that still doesn't change the fact that they've committed this crime.",

I understand that some people will argue that it is to carry on the family name, but this argument isnt acceptable to me because carrying on the family name serves no logical purpose, and if someone still wants to argue on these grounds, then what about parents who only have daughters- dont those daughters deserve to carry on their family name when they have children? \n\nIn my opinion, if children are to be named, they should be given two or three names, all of which are their own- unrelated to their family names. \n\nNote: I also find it incredibly impractical to name children with both the mother and fathers last name because it would just create issues when the child grows up and has to name his/her children.",

There  are many places in the US where the local gas station, grocery store, etc have very low volume because the low population.

And I feel like I am falling apart due to it. I dont think its the fact that I havent been in a relationship, but just the fact that Ive never really been desired by women and I feel like women just arent attracted to me no matter what I do and it makes me just feel hopeless. The fact that I get no female attention and have never been truly wanted and been close with a woman has stopped me from pursuing and moving on in my life. Like Im stuck until I either have 10 girls that I can fuck or a girl who is commited to me in some way. And although Im not a virgin, I lost my virginity to a VERY big girl, in the back of a car, and it was absolutely horrendous. After that Ive gotten nothing in terms of dates or even texting over the phone that has lasted more than like 4 days. This has all gotten to the point where I fucking hate women. Like I wish physical pain upon confident or pretty women. Like I feel like if I ever am with a girl and she says something that would trigger my hate, Id have to hold off beating her down or something. Every woman I see online I just have to leave hate comments saying stuff like whore, useless hole, worthless bitch, etc. I especially get triggered by women who are sexually active and talk about their sex experiences. Like it literally makes me want to do very bad things. And the absolute worst is women desiring men, or certain aspects of men, especially large penises. Seeing a woman talk about wanting a large penis online makes me want to beat the living shit out of them. I dont know how to fix this. And I dont know how to get women either. Dating apps are useless ways for women to just go and either fuck the top 10% of men who already get all of the women, or to just play around with guys like me and just get confidence boosts from all the likes and shit. I fucking despise them. I have serious thoughts of suicide and self harm whenever I see these things. I just feel so unwanted and alone. I just dont understand. Everyone around me tells me Im handsome and that I look good but I k ow I dont. They just lie to me. If I truely looked good then I would have women lining up to be with me. It probably doesnt help that I have serious social anxiety. I have never talked to a woman in public or approached a woman because I know Ill be rejected because theyre just whores. They literally have it so incredibly easy in life and take it for granted. Women have the best lifes they could ask for nowadays and throw it all to shit by allowing the same shitty disgusting uncaring men to degrade them like the pigs women are. Its intolerable. And I dont know what I can do to just get women to want me. Im actually a very kind caring guy and I know how to treat a woman very well on dates and really respect boundaries. But I just have this side of me that hates women to the absolute core.\n\nSo anyway, any tips on getting women? I would really appreciate the help.",

        "title": "CMV: Identity will always divide us :(",
        "selftext": " \n\nNow you may think ignorance, and not identity is the problem. But I think that ignorance is just a scape goat we use (although it is definitely a problem) to ignore the role of identity that has played out in every small or large scale conflict in human history.\n\nIgnorance is generally dispelled with education - and a form of education is experience and exposure to other cultures, other people etc. generally as the world has become more interconnected and globalised due to the internet etc. people have become more progressive as a rule of thumb. But unfortunately there are always exceptions, regardless of their identity. The identifiers that divide just get more numerous the more interconnected and larger the society or society of societies is. The sad thing is we can only transcend maybe one, and then not even that as it will only be a thin veil covering division. I think only when there is something greater than our species as a whole present will humanity have a chance of a strong shared identity.\n\nIn all the vectors that identity divides along, that are largely very intertwined, these , in the least, being Nationality/Ethnicity/Geography/Theology, but also Class/Ideology and Orientation/Gender, there is only one thing that we all share in common. Our humanity. And I believe that only with a shared existential threat will that identity be strong enough to transcend the rest. And that will first take a unified earth government (which is very unlikely to happen, ever), or colonization of other planets to happen, so that as the centuries wear on a strong 'Old Earth' identity will take hold, unfortunately along with the exclusion, exploitation and persecution of all 'off worlder' colonists as an 'other' group. And the only thing to then transcend this and bring about the thin veil of identity as an entire species? The discovery of intelligent life close enough to us to be a potential threat. Then they become the 'Others'. Unfortunately this is what unites people, and always have, according to history, anthropology, psychology and nature.\n\nWe are the victims of our own evolution in this regard, where social groups more than 250 people become abstract, and the empathy generated by the suffering of others reduces as the distance between these small groups increases where no direct interaction exists (how many have watched those charity ads about starving kids half a world away have not donated, but regularly donate to their local food bank?). And if there is less empathy, there is less understanding and it is easier to dehumanize them for various reasons, to i.e. justify violence in conflict. Though this has gotten better with the internet, it still exists i.e. demonisation and dehumanisation of Muslims following 9/11, then migration crisis in Europe caused by the Arab Spring and the wider Sunni/Shia geopolitics in the Middle East, also can't forget the recent and current genocides in Ethiopia and Myanmar etc.\n\nAnd even then, issues of identity will still divide at a micro level, even when we are unified as a solar system spanning society, it's just that at the macro level there is a thin plaster covering the wound of division so you do not notice it as much. e.g. say there is a town, and everyone has the shared identity of being from that town, and there are two high schools in that town and the people that go to those two separate highschools have the identity of going to their respective highschools. 95% of the time there will be a rivalry between the two schools and they will have fights between the two groups of students, unless their identity connected to being from that town is stronger than their identity of attendance to their specific school. And that is a battle in the psychology of each and every student, in some the town will take precedence, in others the school. So some won't have a problem with the other school, may even have friends that go there. But other students will meet up with students from the other school in maccies carpark at lunch and fight. Even though they come from the same town, the same county and the same country, they are of the same ethnicity and religion and of the same orientation and sex. It only takes one vector of identity out of atleast 8 to divide a society, and in extreme but all too common circumstances, conflict to take place.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that identity will always divide us. :(\n\nPlease show me that I am wrong, and that there is hope for a utopia somewhere out there in our future, where everyone can have an assigned  3 titty robo goth gf or a 3 titty robo goth bf and are too united in contentment and joy at their 3 titty pseudo-spouses to care about what divides them in a land of milk and honey.",

If this is achieved then I believe people would stop behaving immorally and we could eventually all live happier, more enriching lives, free from distrust and paranoia.\n\nMight seem like an extreme idea, but the vast majority of people living in modern societies already willingly relinquish their privacy by sharing data with tech corporations as part of their product TOS. The only big difference right now is that the data is only accessable the tech corporations, who's sole aim is to monetize your existence, as well as (probably) government agencies who use this data to police you.\n\nShould we share even our most intimate moments? Yes. How many of us already discuss their most intimate affairs and commit the most intimate acts in earshot of a smart speaker? Tech companies are more than capable of logging all of this data and people could listen in if they wish (whether they actually do or not is another question, sure). What if you knew somebody in your social circle with access to these systems, would you feel so comfortable then? Would you feel comfortable again if you also had access? \n\nWe've already given up so much so easily, without needing anything in return other than some perceived additional conveniences. Why is it normal to give a faceless entity complete access to our lives, that gives essentially nothing back in return, but strange to give the same access to everyone on the proviso that you will receive the same level of access in return? \n\nQuestions of technical feasibility aside (I think a Blockchain protocol could work); just imagine that you lived in a world where anyone could watch you and you could watch anyone else 24/7, no matter who they were. How would you feel about this? Do you think it would improve or damage you and/or wider society? How does such a world play out in your mind?\n\n\nApologies for any bad grammar and I hope the post isn't too meandering. English is my first language, but I'm piss poor at writing.

        "selftext": "Elsewhere on Reddit, I encountered this opinion statement: It is better to regret not having kids than to regret having kids. Ive decided that I agree with this perspective for these reasons: \n\n1) NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OTHERS Both of these types of regret could be painful for you personally to live with, but the latter is more likely to cause more pain in others lives. So, if you regret having kids, that is likely to have a greater negative impact overall because it may hurt not only you but also your relationships with your children, and it may do more damage to your relationships with others in your life (such as your significant other, your friends, your siblings, and your parents). \n\n2) DISTRACTIBILITY If you regret not having kids, then you may be more likely to be able to successfully and harmlessly distract yourself from that regret by focusing on your work, your love life, your pets, and/or your hobbies. If you regret having kids, then it will be more difficult to distract yourself from that regret; if you do succeed in distracting yourself, then you may be a neglectful parent who does not spend an adequate amount of time with the kids. \n\n3) OPPORTUNITIES FOR RELIEF If you regret not having kids, then you may be able to find some degree of relief or comfort through maintaining meaningful relationships with others kids, either by working with kids (e.g., as a schoolteacher or tutor) or through helping others kids (e.g., as a relative or family friend who babysits). These alternatives to having kids of your own may partially satisfy the inner drive to be a parent by allowing you to feel that you are making a positive difference in the lives of children, and they may be beneficial to others as well as to yourself. In contrast, if you regret having kids, then you either could not find any analogous sense of relief or, at the very least, you probably could not do so without compromising your parenting of your kids and possibly feeling guilty.   \n\n4) IRREVERSIBILITY If you regret not having kids, then you may be able to reverse that decision and adopt kids later on, perhaps even later in life. The decision not to have kids is likely to be reversible, especially if you are open to adopting (even as a single and/or older parent), step-parenting, or using IVF with gestational surrogacy. If you regret having kids, then you might opt to escape from your responsibilities by abandoning them, but that is highly irresponsible and likely to be mentally harmful to the kids, who will continue to exist even if you act as if they do not. In other words, you can reverse your decision to be involved with taking care of the kids, but you cannot reverse your decision to have kids. The decision to have kids is a permanent, final decision that creates the need for an ongoing commitment to parenting, but the decision not to have kids may not have to be a permanent one.",

        "selftext": "I define a rational person as a person who makes all of her decisions by weighing the costs and benefits and only doing something if the benefits outweigh the costs. My reasoning is very simple: it takes a significant amount of effort to vote. You need to inform yourself about societal issues and form an opinion about it. You need to determine which party best aligns with your opinions and interests, which is especially difficult in systems with proportional representation. Then you need to physically travel to the voting booth and fill out your form. What are the benefits? Your vote has a extremely small chance of actually affecting the make-up of legislation or the administration, especially if you live in a large country like the USA.\n\nMy country (Netherlands) has approximately 13 million people eligible to vote and a turnout of about 80%, equaling about 10.400.000 people who vote for the house. The house has 150 seats which means a party needs approximately 70.000 votes to gain 1 seat. That means you have 1/70.000 chance to change one seat in the house. The number is even lower if you broaden the scale and take a look at actual legislation. A bill needs 76 votes to pass through the house and even then it still needs to pass the senate. Conclusion: your influence on the political decision making is so small that in realistic terms it's nil.\n\nIt's clear that the costs vastly outweigh the benefits of voting. For some people, this is a very realistic reason not to go out and vote. The voting turnout in the US was 60% last year, which is one of the highest numbers in a long time. Nevertheless, there's still 40% of people who don't believe it's worth the effort, and they're right. If you vote for the sole purpose of wanting to influence the decision making of the government, it's not worth it. There are various ways to mediate this problem, most of which consist of reducing the costs and making it easier. You can also make voting mandatory like they do in Belgium. I don't have the perfect solution.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you shouldn't vote. I personally vote because I believe in democracy and want my voice to be heard but I acknowledge this as irrational behavior. If everyone were to be 100% rational, nobody would vote. If nobody voted then 1 person who would, could change the entire composition of the government. So in this case, it's good that people aren't rational beings.",

Why is tipping encouraged in one case but not the other. I think this has to do more with culture than anything else. \n\nI think there is some level of inconsistency here. People say you should tip because delivery drivers will will not be able to make a living wage otherwise, but the fact of the matter is that the government will force the employer to make up the difference to get to the minimum wage in delivery jobs if the driver is not able to get there via tips. So in essence, we are subsidizing the employer. \n\nWe don't do that for grocery stores, why do we do that for Pizza Hut. \n\nIf you tip your delivery driver, you should also be tipping your cashier everytime as well since both are service employees making minimum wage. \n\nIf you do not tip your cashier then you should also feel comfortable not tipping your delivery driver as well. \n\nEither way is consistent, but to treat one service employee (delivery driver) as if tipping is of greater importance to their livelihood compared to the other (cashier) makes absolutely no sense. \nCMV",

If they can't even stand up to a little American actress and they don't have the stones to stand by their traditional and ethnocentric opinions, then there is no point to them existing. A Royal family should have to power to openly say that they will only award royal titles to family members who are fully ethnically European and that non-European individuals like Meghan Markle and Archie can't qualify for titles. This is not exactly a very controversial opinion and millions in Europe will agree, as well as millions of people of the non-European races will feel the same way about their own royal families. This isn't even racism; it is basic ethnocentrism and has been a normal, mainstream human trait since the beginning of time. **Mis-characterizing ethnocentrism as racism is just a subjugation tactic by the anti-white/anti-European far left.**\n\nBut why are the royals afraid to openly stand by their sentiments? Why do they deny their feelings publicly but stick to them in the shadows of Buckingham palace? Why do the Royals have this fear? Surely kings, queens, princes and princesses should be able to speak freely without consequences; they are royalty after all, for crying out loud. (Note, this is limited to speech, not actions and physical hurting their subjects.)\n\nIf a Queen and a Prince have to police their own speech and only say politically correct, far-left approved things or face cancellation as if they were common plebs, then what is the point of even having royalty?\n\nThe idea of a Queen having to check her speech and being too afraid to say that a black woman can't be royalty in the UK, because lefties and black immigrants will be upset, is absurd. \n\nEither the monarchy should be able to say what they want, or they should be abolished.

        "selftext": "I want to change my Mind on this.\n\nMy understanding is that taxes on capital are by in large more harmful then taxes on land (helpful, not Harmful) and labour (less harmful). For example, according to the financial times (original article here: https://www.google.ca/amp/s/financialpost.com/opinion/its-the-worst-tax-other-countries-are-eliminating-it-and-canada-should-too/wcm/ad5da390-8bd7-4d4b-86a8-42c9ce2e5d23/amp/)\n\n&gt; In the case of New Zealand, the elimination of the capital gains tax was part of the sweeping reforms that started in the 1980s and shifted from taxing capital and savings to taxing consumption, which has less deleterious effects on economic growth. These reforms were important in improving the economic situation of the country relative to its neighbours\n\n&gt; One study looked at the case of Switzerland, where in addition to the central government, some districts (or cantons) eliminated the capital gains tax. It found that elimination increased the size of the economy by between one and three per cent.\n\n&gt; Another study, this one of Hong Kong, found that thanks to the absence of a capital gains tax, the territorys savings rate is well above that of similar industrialized economies.\n\nMoreover, no country afaik generates significant revenue from their capital gains tax. According to the tax foundation (source: https://taxfoundation.org/us-taxpayers-face-6th-highest-top-marginal-capital-gains-tax-rate-oecd/) the highest rates are around 30-40% in Denmark, France, Finland, Ireland Sweden and the United States. It does seem Australia taxes personal capital gains as income, and corporate capital gains as corporate income according to tax summaries. (Source: https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/quick-charts/capital-gains-tax-cgt-rates)\n\nOverall, I am just not convinced a capital gains tax would raise sufficient revenue to be worth risking economic growth to raise.\n\nAssuming that a generous Scandinavian style welfare state was the goal, would there be a problem to taxing capital gains as labour income on an accrual basis? ie you purchase a stock at $100 and each year you pay a tax equal to the income tax on gains even if they are unrealized.\n\nAs of right now, I am opposed to raising the capital gains tax in this manner even though I support a Scandinavian style welfare state because it seems like it would just cause deadweight loss (less investment, shrink economic growth, capital flight etc etc). But I would love there to be an easy fix to funding issues, and if raising the capital gains rate works, I will change my mind.",

        "selftext": "So, I started watching Mary: Queen of Scots (2018) and Queen Elizabeths ambassador to Scotland is a black man (Adrian Lester, fantastic British thespian). Now I love period pieces, big student of history, grew up watching all the old swords and sandals epics that just don't get made anymore and by and large, movies are inaccurate as hell at the best of times. \n\nSo what's my problem here? Well of course movies can be inaccurate, they're meant to tell stories, largely fictional, but if a historical piece, then they usually try to be as close as they can to reality, within reason. But casting a black man as the Queen of England's personal ambassador, is just a bizarre choice to make. Were there black people in England in the 1500's? Undoubtedly. But as servants at best, slaves and labourers at worst. Never would one have been elevated to such high status.\n\nThis got me thinking of inaccurate retellings in general and why people feel the need to rewrite history just to seemingly pander to minorities for diversity brownie points. \n\nI really like the Avengers movies, dumb and fun. Casting Idris Elba as Heimdall? Odd choice. But a good one. He's a marvellous actor and played the role very well. You may think this at odds with my whole point but it isn't. Avengers is pure fantasy. Cast whoever you want as whoever you want as long as the fun doesn't stop. Chinese Captain America? Might raise a few eyebrows but if they played the role well, who would really care? I wouldn't.\n\nBut history isn't fantasy, until you rewrite it to be so. It becomes a slippery slope to a retelling of all of our darkest moments in history to be brighter and less odious affairs. Cinema is pretty much the only way that modern audiences learn anything of history, since books and classical subjects are less and less likely to be studied. So if movies are how most people learn about the past, we owe it to them to be as accurate as possible, where it merits it.\n\nIf you want to cast for diversity in a historical piece, the story should either be obvious fiction, or simply tell a story from a different culture. Tell more stories of African history. I for one would love a good modern piece about Haile Selassie or Shaka. There's no reason to alter history with dubious casting, simply for diversity when the world has enough stories to tell without doing so.",

Thus, for each Olympic event, there are usually two categories - mens, and womens. This is done to let the less-able biological group still have a chance to compete against their 'equals', and achieve success.\n\nAnother biological advantage, is the one that (predominantly) black people have over other ethnicities. Now, there are many different events in the Olympics, and most have ethnicity swings/bias - often due to societal reasons, not biological - so let's look solely at the 100 metres, as it's the most popular Olympic event.\n\nIn the Men's 100m, the Final has been dominated by black athletes. You have to go all the way back to the 1980 Final to find a non-black athlete - meaning that since 1980, there have been 72 athletes in 100m Olympic Finals, and all 72 of them have been black. There is no mistake that black athletes have a fundamental biological advantage over non-black athletes - just as male athletes have a fundamental biological advantage over female athletes.\n\nHence, I believe if you agree with gender segregation at the Olympics, you should also agree with ethnicity segregation.",

However I believe it applies to the majority of the people I am about to discuss:\n\nI believe that todays Outrage/Cancel Culture, more specifically on social media sites like Twitter, is simply a result of peoples desire to have the most retweeted/liked/upvoted hot take of the week and the recognition that comes along with it. And that they truly deep down dont really give a rats ass about the issue they are complaining about.\n\nI always thought this since cancel culture started but what really solidified it for me is when last week Gen Z tried to cancel Eminem for his lyrics of the past. Why now? Eminems music has been available to listen to all along, so why now are people running to Twitter to call for the cancellation of Eminem?\n\nI believe its simply because someone sought out a new controversy that they can be the leading face of on Twitter for when Good Morning America reports on it. They want their tweet to be plastered on the news report on the television.\n\nI believe another part of this has to do with how our western society celebrates activists like the MLKs, Gandhis, Mandelas, Harvey Milks, etc.(and rightfully so of course) However those individuals actually deeply cared about the issues they were fighting for, and most of the time were martyrs for movements bigger than themselves. They didnt do it for the fame.   \n\nBut Twitter activists are the opposite, they are putting the cart before the horse in a way. They seek out some sort of issue so that they could come up with some witty hot take tweet on for the recognition of fake internet points and maybe a screenshot on the morning/evening news. They dont really care about the issue, otherwise they would be donating/organizing/doing anything more than sitting on their ass and complaining on Twitter.\n\nIn conclusion I believe people want this recognition because they know deep down that in the grand scheme of things, that their lives are meaningless, their names wont be in the history books, and they wont have biopics made after them. They will be forgotten in history. But maybe, just maybe, if they make a witty enough hot-take tweet, they can become the face of a movement and be remembered.\n\nDamn do I sound old and jaded",

        "title": "CMV: Entering into a relationship or marriage is not worth it for a man, given how easily the woman can have him arrested on false accusations of rape/abuse or screw him in the divorce courts",
        "selftext": "TLDR: It is frighteningly easy for a woman to ruin a man's life on a complete whim, either by falsely claiming abuse or rape or through the divorce courts, even if the man has done nothing wrong. She in fact benefits from doing so. This risk vastly outweighs any benefits that a man may get from a relationship, and as such men should not pursue relationships.\n\nI'll start off by saying that I am a  straight man who has never been in a relationship for a variety of  reasons, and that I know very little about how most relationships  actually play out. This is also not meant to attack women who are  legitimately victims of rape or abuse.\n\nInspired by [this horrifying post](https://www.reddit.com/r/awfuleverything/comments/m3b04x/just_awful/)  I saw today. It's not the first time I've read a story about a man who  gets attacked by his domestic partner, and rather than hit her back or  act in self-defense, he calls the police. Yet when the police arrive,  the wife unharmed plays victim and claims that the bleeding battered man  actually attacked her. The cops then force the man out of his own house  or arrest him.\n\nGranted this is anecdotal evidence, but you only need to look at the [Duluth Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth_model)\n\n and its criticisms to understand how men can be punished for being a  victim. It is based on the incorrect belief that men cannot be victims,  or that women cannot attack men. Regardless of the rate at which men are  abused vs women are abused, this is completely false because a woman  absolutely can attack a man. Men are also taught to never hit girls,  which has somehow evolved into \"men should never use any form of  self-defense against girls even if they are being attacked\".\n\nThis  ultimately gives the woman a green light to attack the man. Sure he  might fight back, but she knows that he probably won't because if he  does, his situation immediately goes from terrible to absolutely fucked.  The cops will see any kind of retaliatory or defensive action, no  matter how peaceful , as domestic violence on his part. No matter what  happens or how he responds, ultimately he is getting sent to jail or at  least thrown out of the house for the night.\n\nEffectively  the woman can decide one day to attack the man or even attempt to kill  him, and will face absolutely no consequences. Meanwhile the man gets  arrested or forced to leave his own house, possibly tried for assault.  He might also have his reputation ruined or get fired from his job, just  because he was at the complete mercy of his abusive domestic partner.\n\nEven  if the two are not living together, or the woman never actually had the  man arrested, she can still accuse him of rape or assault on a whim -  in fact, she can do so even if they aren't in a relationship. A woman  can easily accuse a man of rape and get him arrested and tried, purely  on her word alone. If the innocent man is lucky enough to get acquitted,  chances are his reputation is still irrevocably tarnished, he got fired  from his job/expelled from school, and society still sees him as a  rapist. She can still slander him over social media or through word of  mouth and people will readily believe her.\n\nGranted  there is a very significant difference between an actual rapist getting  acquitted, versus a man getting acquitted because the women knowingly  filed a false rape claim. This difference is often very hard to prove.  Yet even in those cases when it is proved that the woman made up the  claim, or she admits she did, she is either not charged or sentenced to a  laughable fraction of what the man would have been sentenced to.\n\nMoving  on to divorce courts: here is another place where men are intentionally  discriminated against. Regardless of pre-marriage income or present  income, the man is often required to pay exorbitant amounts of his  salary to his ex-wife as alimony and child support. Even if the wife  also has her own income or remarries to someone else who has an income,  since she is supposedly entitled to her pre-divorce standard of living.\n\nMen  are also given less favorable custody agreements, in the case of  equally competent parents, or even when the children vocally prefer to  stay with the father or the wife is mentally unstable or has drug or  alcohol issues. The courts heavily marginalize the man's right to see  his own children. The woman also does not have to prove that the money  she receives as child support actually goes towards the child(ren), and  there have been many cases when a woman spent the child support money on  herself while her children did not receive adequate clothing,  schooling, or medical care.\n\nAnd if the man can't pay that much, then he loses the right to see his children and sometimes gets thrown in jail.\n\n[One particularly egregious](https://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/businessman-ordered-to-pay-spousal-support-to-his-ex-girlfriend/)  example of this is when a man in Canada split up from his girlfriend  and was ordered to pay her $50,000 A MONTH in alimony for ten years.  Even though they were never married and never even lived together. That  is SIX MILLION DOLLARS just because he dated someone.\n\nUltimately,  the woman benefits enormously because she receives an extremely  favorable custody agreement as well as exorbitant amounts of money from  the man.\n\nThe way I see it, it is  incredibly easy for a vindictive woman to ruin her SO's life on a  complete whim. In fact she has active motivation to do so, because of  the money, sympathy, and attention she will receive. Meanwhile the man -  who is completely innocent - can suffer physical and mental abuse,  being thrown out of his own house, being fired from his job, being  socially ostracized, being unable to see his own kids, having to pay the  majority of his wages to a woman he no longer has any connection to,  and being arrested. Granted, this doesn't happen to all men in a  relationship. But it is happening at an increasing rate as women realize  that they will only benefit from screwing over a man's life, and as  divorce rates climb.\n\nAny positives  that come from a relationship are IMO completely outweighed by how easily a man can suffer such irrevocable damage through no fault of his  own.",

I would imagine that a non paid surrogate, if they fuck up, accidently or otherwise, would just waste the family's time.\n\nI know there's also the 'moral' aspect, but my view is, if someone wants to be paid for something that is not abusive, why not? I don't really see the difference between being a surrogate and being a nanny. Yeah, surrogacy uses the literal body, but so is all work. If you say pregnancy is 'abusive' then obviously all pregnant women are abused. That's not true. Consensual pregnancy isn't abusive at all, with or without money.\n\nI will concede I don't know too much about surrogacy, I just have been seeing a lot of surrogacy ads (oddly) on Facebook\n\nAnyways, is there any point that Canada is doing better than USA?",

Prostitution is like a beauty pageant, the \"sexier\" people would do good whereas the others not so much, which would lead to people being depressed and insecure about their bodies. This is similar to how people feel bad because of stereotypes created by porn.\n\nPeople would feel bad as their bodies won't be able to earn them easy money.  The way a person looks is due to their genetics, which are determined by luck. Luck shouldn't be rewarded in any sane system.\n\nThis would also lead to shaky marriages as people would be more and more insecure about their bodies. As a result of which many kids would have bad childhoods as they'd have to navigate their way through a splitting family.\n\n2. It is also often said that there's no difference between prostitution and manual labor. But in my opinion there is, manual labor is influenced by a person's skill and not by the way they look (which is due to luck).\n\nManual labor is also important to keep economies going and things like farming, construction etc. would stall economies if criminalised, but many countries seem to be doing fine even with criminalised prostitution.\n\n\n*********************\n\nLet's imagine a scenario, \nWould it be equal to rape, If a person were a plumber and were forcefully made to repair a leaking tap, in a world where prostitution is considered a job?",

He has some meaningless, drunken ramblings as well, several minute epic tales, and others perplexingly mysterious. I have heard all my life him called a genius, a hack, a poet, a poser among many others.\n\nHis voice is by technical standards, not good most of the time, I really shouldnt have to argue this but will if I must. On the occasional live performance or recording, his voice sounds what I would deem not terrible. However, when taken in context, there is something about Bob Dylan that just seems good to me. I went through a phase of listening to his discography for a good 2 years before adding it to the back catalogue of music I still like but no longer listen to actively. I dont believe everyone will agree with me that he is good. In fact, I rarely consider a persons negative opinion of Dylan to be invalid. Therefore, it interests me to see if any of you could change my mind that Bob Dylan is not good.",

        "title": "CMV: Systemic Racism is a significant issue within Education",
        "selftext": "Having lost a general debate about racism in the US, but still relatively unshaken in more specific racism, I invite anyone to challenge Education inequality.\n\nArgument:\n\nRacism begins at a young age in school, which inherently causes this to continue in their life. This point links to incarceration due to the similarity between suspension/expulsion and putting someone in jail. The government is unwilling to fix the problems existing within school systems, extending forth the systemic racism. In fact, education likely teaches racism by furthering bias and favoring whites.\n \nThe racism is so significant that minorities feel distressed and mental issues regarding the problem. \"Elevated levels of Cultural Mistrust, Cultural Race-Related Stress, and Individual Race Related Stress lead to increased use of Emotion-Based Coping behaviors ....\" [3]\n\nThe above point is supported by Scientific Magazine: \"Universities are not level playing fields where all students have an equal opportunity to participate and succeed. The misuse of standardized tests such as the GRE excludes students who could have otherwise succeeded (4). Once admitted, Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) face challenges when transitioning to college life (5) and are more likely to be nontraditional students.\" [6] Thus, even the tests naturally discriminate against minorities. We are actively preventing students from succeeding merely due to their skin color.\n\nAnother study regarding schooling proves that assumptions exist earlier on, which further enhances my incarceration point. People will assume things of blacks -- that they are more responsible, older, and maybe inherently related to Crime. From the American Psychology Association, \"black boys can be seen as responsible for their actions at an age when white boys still benefit from the assumption that children are essentially innocent\" [17]. The negative interactions with black children caused the unconscious dehumanization of blacks. And since the assumptions start from such a young age, this continues well into adulthood, establishing the baseline that racism doesn't just come out of nowhere. \n\nBlacks are also suspended at a disproportional rate [18], noting that from federal data \"for every 100 students...white students lost 43 days to suspension, while black students lost 121 days\". The huge difference between the two races proves that the problem is systemic and significant. Indeed, a GAO report proves that the representation of suspended blacks was severe in percentage difference. \n\n\"School to Prison\" is a known term, where the schools cause the minority students to become ostracized. The extremely harsh punishments push them to become neglected and build upon their vulnerability, raising this point to the next level. [19] As a result of this educational racism, a very high proportion of minorities are also dropping out of school. [20] How does Con explain this, if this is not due to the problems I've listed?\n \nAnother research article furthers on how Brown V Board was not enough to dismantle our systemic Racism. \"[Schools] remain effectively segregated due to the following: discrimination in schools by administrators, teachers, and students; racial bias in the school curriculum; the separation of students into different ability tracks reflecting racial, class, and gender stratification; and the use of standardized testing that contains significant racial and class bias.\" [25] The law wasn't effectively enforced, proving that our system has failed.\n \nThe publication first counters Con by showing that even the founding fathers had intended for the oppression of minorities: \"[Those] who drafted the U.S. Constitution..built into the countrys foundation certain mechanisms designed to maintain the enslavement of African Americans to unjustly enrich many white Americans..\".\n \nIndeed, the article further lists that many cases show our unfair discrimination and inability to fulfill the ideals of equality. \"Cases which have come to this Court depict a spectacle of slavery unwilling to die. . . . Negroes have been excluded over and again from juries . . . . They have been made to attend segregated and inferior schools . . . . They have been forced to live in segregated residential districts . . . .\" The problems and accusations go on.\n \nThere is also expounding upon how white men tend to abuse their power within the education system. As a collective whole, merely a handful of individual racism could not have caused this problem. The corruption of bias influences the use of power, which stems from systemic racism. \"The failure [lies] with the greatest political, economic, and civic power, who have long been mostly white. White elites  have made decisions that have reversed progress toward substantial school desegregation since the 1970s.\" \n \nUnfortunately, despite the momentary successes of Brown, our society remains unchanged with the practices of segregation. It's first highlighted that President Dwight Eisenhower faced pressure from white teachers and school leaders, making it impossible to make further progress. The history displays precisely this: \"Oklahoma v. Dowell and freeman v. Pitts decisions indicated that the Supreme Court would permit large-scale resegregation of schools. ..  Today, as Orfieldand Eaton notes, [d]esegregation remedies can even be removed when achievement gaps between the races have widened, or even if a district has never fully implemented an effective desegregation plan. You can see how deep the racism goes, going beyond mere persons and now into the most trusted authorities in the US. \n\nImpacts\n \nCrucial resources are denied for black students, which inherently destroys ideals for equality and halts potential progress for the future.\n \nIf the power of desegregation wasn't obvious, my source further explains the education denied for blacks. Firstly they say, \"One major study found that black third-graders in predominantly white schools read better than initially similar blacks who have attended predominantly black schools. Secondly, they support this by saying yet another study with 1,800 students found both white and black students performed better with desegregation. Why wouldn't they? After all, with greater equality, you have harmony, unity, team spirit, acceptance, all key for success. In contrast to the world I show where most black kids have trouble in their academics, the ideal world displays the great difference that we could have been making.\n \nNext, to add upon the expulsion rates in schools, the research thirdly adds, \"Black students from desegregated, substantially white schools typically are more successful ... than those students from traditionally segregated schools\". Of course, common knowledge tells us that going to universities greatly helps you in your future career. I won't bother sourcing that. Instead, I will further that the states refuse to compromise, despite being a crucial component of the system, and a smaller sub-system in itself. \n \nThe expert continues: \"...the state not only tolerates the funding gulf between Milwaukee and its suburban counterparts, but it has also instituted policies that allow the gap to widen\". The result is vastly reduced access to critical job networks that all people deserve to have. Also, the segregation arbitrarily prevents resource access as a result. \"Research indicates that other critical resources, such as the availability of small classes and college placement courses, are not equitably distributed.\"  \n \nI will spare you the summary of the rest of the report. The discrimination within the school and its impacts are continuously analyzed for at least a dozen pages. Needless to say that systemic racism has a very significant impact on education.\n\nI will supply sources for any one who asks. They are nearly all expert sources, however, so I dissuade anyone from attacking them.",

        "selftext": " Hadn't gained much traffic last time so I'm trying again\n\nI realized lately that more and more mixes have been hit with the \"blocked in country option\". No biggie right? Well, it turns out that blocked actually meant blocked worldwide. I feel that this option is started to become abused and I propse a rather crazy solution, remove it altogether. Why?\n\n1. With the removal of the block worldwide, people could still select individual countires where they want the content gone. Except, this time, they have to click individually for each coountry. Yes, this is meant to be a tactic that disuades anybody to abuse the button. Everytime you want something gone from across the world, you must click each and every single country. I've seen what the copyright takedown form, and it requires a lot of stuff. This would greatly discourage people from filing fradulent takedowns left and right\n2. The other way to issue takedown is with an actual takedown. But, that is part of the law and carries with it a stigma. It's a purely legal matter at this point and most people wouldn't want to waste too much time and resources on a single person. Sure, it may carry more harm than a block but at the same time, the bigger consequences. A block is way more legal grey matter than a strike.\n3. Block worldwide is a Youtube only thing. Sure, the strike system is law mandated, but not blocks. Blocks give way too much benefit at the cost of being abused. This give people 2/3 ways to remove a video they don't like. Blocks can be automated, which would make things much more difficult. I don't think a robot should be determined what should and shouldn't exist. With claims, the stakes are much smaller. Overall, block worldwide is a redundent system that only serves as a takedown with more steps. At the same time, prevent it from legal reprecussions as it's a youtube only thing and the takedowner can argue that they're using something that the system created and promoted.\n\nTL:DR The \"block\"'s original function had been made redundent by the easier option of what's essentially a legally grey are of copyright abuse",

This led to rioting and the rise of the All Lives Matter movement (ALM from here on). People who support ALM use it as a comeback to those that say BLM. I see that these people have good intentions, but to me it's obvious that they don't know the full extent of what they're saying.\n\nIn my opinion, BLM is an outlet for protest against police brutality. It just so happens that minorities, black people specifically, are far more likely to die at the hands of the police. I can tell however that this connotation doesn't come off as well when asserted in front of burning buildings. \n\nTo be completely honest, I don't fully disagree with the rioters. The exact same things happened back in the 70s around the same time as the OG Simpson case. People are sick and tired of no change and if they don't get it for almost 50 years, they explode. Despite all this, I'll be the first to admit that excessive violence isn't the best way to protest murder. \n\nSo, when people say ALM as a response to BLM, they're dismissing the fact that black people are statistically more likely to be victims of police brutality than white people, and I can tell you that without the need of looking up a study. By saying ALM, you're plugging your ears to the truth and locking yourself in an echo chamber where everything is perfect and absolutely nothing needs to be fixed with our country.",

Climate Change: Liberals say lets invest in renewable energy research and production so we will have a viable alternative farther down the line and can currently make a gradual transition away from gas. Republicans debate whether climate change is real and say solutions are too expensive. \n2. Poor communities: Liberals say we should educate children in less privileged schools about not just college opportunities but also trade jobs that offer paid apprenticeships. Republicans say well, their parents shouldn't have had kids. \n\nI'm sure there will be people that argue that they are not harmful just neutral, but when these individuals prevent plans from being implemented they do end up actively doing harm in my opinion. That being said, I think this is definitely a newer opinion of mine since I used to have a no harm no foul mindset. I'm trying to see if this new opinion is deficit in significant ways.",

        "selftext": "The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as \"the greatest or most significant or most influential\" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics, instead, are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers.\nIn a sense, the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, most rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply highlight what product the music business wants to make money from.\n\nHopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. At such a time, rock critics will study their rock history and understand which artists accomplished which musical feat, and which simply exploited it commercially.\n\nBeatles' \"Aryan\" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.\n\nContemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for good reason. They could never figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to \"Beatlemania\", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon &amp; McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Four'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of entire operas such as \"Tommy\" and \"Quadrophenia\"; not to mention the far greater British musicians who followed them in subsequent decades or the US musicians themselves who initially spearheaded what the Beatles merely later repackaged to the masses.\n\nThe Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented \"Beatlemania\" in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time reading these pages about such a trivial band.",

I think inceldom is a danger to society in a whole lot of ways.\n\nHowever, Its inherently true that theres a group of men that will find love-life really hard, its a minority  its not anyone whos not a chad like most incels say but it still exists, and Im in that demography lets say.\n\nI consider myself an actual good guy, in fact I come off as a pushover sometimes in a certain way. Im not an asshole or at least I try not to be. I know that the problem doesnt arise from there.\n\nI also shower every day, brush my teeth both times per day, I have a good haircut and have a decent physique, I have a normal fashion sense and whatnot. There was actually a time where I was obsessed by improving how I look.\n\nSo.. girls have never shown interest for me in my entire life, Im invisible to them. When a girl sees someone who they like they usually smile at them, when they see me on the street they look at me with a please dont rape me look.\n\nAny time I want to approach a girl in parties  And Im not talking about girls way out of my league they always make body language as if theyre extremely uncomfortable and even sometimes just turn around and leave. \n\nYou might think that Im extremely awkward, and Its not that, I may not be charming and charismatic but its definitely just the looks.\n\nI dont care about sex or anything like that, I just want someone to love me, it sucks seeing girls being all over chads who are sometimes pieces of shit. Ive never experienced love, girls make my day when they treat me like a normal human being, imagine how desperate I am. Everyone should see [this video](https://youtu.be/1n5nOEJtrYA)\n\nNow, getting the introduction out of the way, heres what I agree with incels. Theyre right that bluepilled advice  normal advice like just be confident bro or work out on your personality! is straight-up bullshit if youre ugly, there are people who have really low chances of getting laid in their youth unless they pay for a hooker (in my case its not about getting laid, I just want someone to love me).\n\nI also agree that incels  not talking about forum incels, Im talking about actual involuntary celibates are often marginalized by society. Also, society is really hypocritical with the fat acceptance movement but when it comes to men they all need to be attractive. Im not saying it should be that way, but men problems are usually ignored with the excuse of just man up.\n\nSorry for the rant. Even if it doesnt seem that way, I actually want my view changed because I dont want to get deeper into the rabbit hole to the point of being a sexist and a bigot. I really cant find an optimist answer to the issue, its all blackpill.\n\nThank you in advance.",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI've grown up in a city where the advice \"cut negative people out of your life\" is extremely common. People often give this as advice when talking about relationships, friendships or even acquaintances. The advice is often unprompted and spontaneous, or it comes out of related discussions.\n\nThe reasoning behind this point of view (as far as I can gather), is that we are influenced by the people we surround ourselves by. If we cut out all negative people, we can have a happier life. If all of the people we talk to are positive, then we will become positive. As a result, life will be a lot easier to deal with. It's also more fun and exciting talking to bubbly, happy people than people who seem sad or down.\n\nMy practical experience of this advice is as follows. When I or anyone I know is going through a bad time (including mental illness), people will simply stop talking to that person for \\~3 - 6 months. The idea is to 'wait out' the negativity, by cutting that person out of your life for the period it takes for them to recover. I have had this done to me and I have done this to other people. In both respects, I feel that the advice has caused great harm.\n\nOne of the leading causes of mental illness is isolation, and one of the leading causes of prolonging mental illness is isolation. At the same time, one of the common DIY 'treatments' to many mental illnesses (loosely termed) is socializing and having a strong support network.\n\nI believe that by cutting negative people out of our lives we are either causing mental illness or prolonging mental illness in the people we are cutting out. Another byproduct is the obvious imperative to therefore appear 'happy' at all times. This leads to men (predominantly, as far as I can tell), not talking about their suffering and mental illness. This effect is just as damaging, for the same reasons listed above (we need to share our emotions in order to properly deal with them).\n\nBefore you mention it, I know that the common objection to my view will be \"people need to look after themselves\". On the one hand, some people can't handle negative people in their life, for they are suffering themselves. On the other, the negative person should deal with their own issues via psychology etc. The problem with both of these points is again, a strong support system is essential to recovery for many mental illnesses. A psychologist is not always enough on their own.\n\nI am willing to change my view on this. I feel quite negatively about myself and others who have internalized this advice, so if I could change my view I would probably feel better about myself and other people.",

        "selftext": "To start explaining this theory I must first explain what \"Quantum Immortality\" is.\n\nQuantum Immortality is a variation of the Schrödinger's cat. Supposedly, there exists an alternate universe in which you have taken the precise and right choices to live extensively until your biologic clock stops naturally and without any disease or external factor that might shorten your life even by a second, in which case, another branch will open to where that didn't happen. So you are alive and dead somewhere at the same time.\n\nSolipsism is a belief which states everything outside yourself might be unreal, and the only certain thing in life is that \"I EXIST\". Might be that the universe is simulated, you are creating or imagining the universe, or you might be in a coma dreaming all of this somewhere else.\n\nQuantum Solipsism seeks then, to explain why you are still alive.\n\nThis excludes, of course, everyone you coexist with: your parents, your siblings, your friends, etc. Only you as an individual exist, let's call this \"You\": \"I\" instead.\n\nEverybody coexists right now in the same universe, Me reading this, Me ignoring this. We all are in the same page. But the thing is: ***perhaps you have died many times by now and you didn't even realise.***\n\nTo follow this, If I die RIGHT NOW, I will just be taken to an alternative universe in which I haven't died, that's all, maybe I will take a different choice, a different path, the disease won't trigger, the accident won't happen or maybe I won't even be there at all. Of course, I will be taken to another \"world\" where external things will remain the same because I never died, but I will never now either and nobody will.\n\nOn the other hand, If I die RIGHT NOW, everybody else will stay in this universe in which I actually died and my relatives will mourn me sadly, but the true I will be still alive in another universe that could have small differences, such as Me not remembering something everybody was sure I was involved in, mistaking an \"a\" for an \"e\" in a cereal brand I was sure it was an \"a\" but probably I died in the universe where indeed was an \"a\", a different street name, a Déjà Vu and so on.\n\nThere is actually no way to disprove or test this theory but thinking about why I haven't died is because of quantum solipsism is an interesting idea. \n\nLet's go further.\n\nLet's say I think \"Ok, I will jump off a bridge to test this\". Two things might happen.\n\n* a) I survive but I will have to live the rest of my life with the marks the event left in me such as amputated limbs, mental disabilities, deformities and such, still I won't know if this theory is actually true.\n* b) I die, but I will be taken to a different universe where I didn't or the idea didn't even cross my mind. Still, I won't know if this theory is actually true, and my family would be devastated in the previous universe tho. Indicating I die A LOT in my daily life.\n\nThis could explain some visions, déjà vus, single Mandela effects, or nightmares where I die, but in theory, I am indestructible, but not exempt of factors that might difficult my existence, like bad choices, but I might also die tomorrow in this universe, guess I'll never know. Eventually, my life will funnel down a lot of deaths until the biological body won't allow me to live a single extra second and then I will really die. Remember, life will only open branches from the previous universe, therefore, I will never wake up in a universe where my dog didn't die from an awful disease, unfortunately.",

Its infinitely more likely that your political ideologies are what they are because they would be more ideal for you, a view shaped by your context, rather than because theyd be more ideal for the world.\n\nIdeal for you might look like feeling good about yourself because of your altruism, or feeling good about yourself because of your success, or feeling good about yourself because of the impressive pain you made it through. Just because your ideal seems to have a good impact on yourself or the world according to your values doesnt mean its superior to any other ideal.\n\nCertainty that were right causes unproductive conflict, shuts down conversations and ostracises the other. Collectively, these effects hamstring problem solving. Instead, by collectively challenging what we believe, looking for the weaknesses in our own ideologies and the strength in others, we have a much better shot at building solutions the world (tends to) agree improve the things the world (generally) considers problems. I.e. Rather than trying to beat the other side, bringing about our own ideals at the cost of theirs, we could be creating ideals that better suit all of us.\n\nTL;DR: The chances that your beliefs, or even the general beliefs of your context, just happen to be the most right in history is really bloody low. Youre almost certainly wrong in big ways. Were doing far more harm than good by talking like we know best. \n\nSo, if were laughing at someone else for their crazy immovable beliefs, were exactly the same as them; a big fuckin hypocrite. Humility is the only way to actually do better.",

        "selftext": "Monarchies should not exist in the modern world. The notion that certain families have a divine right to rule or represent an entire nation is an antiquated and primitive mentality that we should have left behind centuries ago. Historically, monarchies were oppressive and tyrannical regimes. Especially in Europe. Monarchs have a long history of subjugating people under their rule, forcing them to work for their benefit, and sending them off to die fighting to acquire more wealth, land, and power for themselves. This is why people in some countries, like France and Russia, felt they had no choice but to violently overthrow them.\n\nThe monarchies that are still around are a stain from the feudal era. We continue to celebrate them and uphold their legacy. They serve no purpose aside from extracting unearned wealth from the masses and acting as figureheads or de facto representatives of entire nations, when in reality they have nothing in common with the people who live in their respective nations. Because of this, I dont see any reason for them to exist anymore.",

This wouldn't be a panacea, but would go a long way in achieving the goal of lessening the donor class-centric politics that we currently have in the US.\n \nTo change my view, make a convincing argument that an alternative means would be able to make all voters' more equal in influencing their own government.

        "selftext": "I've been out of the closet for years, and most of the guys I've dated have been fem. I'm so happy that people are finally accepting of fem guys, and letting men explore emotions and fashion that restrictive gender roles had shamed them for. I'm also exploring.\n\nI've also seen how unhappy fem guys are with places like r/196 and anime/furry places. The hypersexualization and infantilization are definitely the main problems, I think most people would agree. But even if you managed to get rid of the sex stuff and patronizing, I think the narrow focus on a *very specific* look is even more restrictive than the gender roles that fem guys struggled with.\n\n9 times out of 10, the depictions of femboys are stylized drawings that are more feminine than most women, and the rest are young cosplayers with a ton of effort put in to their look. These are fine goals, and I'd be lying if I said they weren't really pretty. The problem is that the narrative of most of the memes doesn't seem to acknowledge the extreme amount of effort and genetic luck necessary to look like that, *especially* over the age of 24. Crucially, unlike working out or growing facial hair, it isn't common knowledge that you can stick with it and slowly get results - it's very easy to believe that you're \"not cut out\" to be a femboy and simply give up.\n\nIn the past, feminine styles like glam, scene fashion, dainty theatrical, all had a wide range. You could add a moustache to any of them, and it wouldn't cease to be that style. And these styles don't become extremely difficult once you get older.\n\nThe femboy image is also inseparable from UwU positivity. There aren't many examples of beefy guys in their 30s acting kawaii, and when they do it's mostly \"cursed\" ironic humor.\n\nThe most insidious part is that a big part of the UwU positivity culture is telling people they're cute without having any idea how they look - so the inevitable shock when a guy tries on a dress and he doesn't look like an anime femboy isn't even addressed. So it becomes very easy to believe it's just you, you're too ugly or old or mannish to join the cool kids being ecstatically pretty, who all have no problems and look just like their anime/furry avatars, but the only appreciation *you'll* get is people politely lying, and it will only get worse as you get older.\n\n**Tl;dr** guys who want to experiment with feminine presentation are being encouraged to try an extremely difficult and inflexible all-or-nothing style which slaps you with dysmorphia, and the wave of UwU positivity completely hides this difficulty.",

Both Churchil and Roosevelt were white supremacists by today's standards. So does that mean nazis fought against nazis in WW2?  I doubt any of those white men who stormed the beaches of Normandy would have approved of their white daughters marrying black men and giving them mixed race, Nigritic looking grandchildren.\n\nAnd then we get to \"white nationalism\".  This is really just a scary sounding label for a very mainstream, traditional and very normal sentiment - the desire of a certain ethnic group to have its own territory where it is the majority, as well as a the desire to preserve it's ancestral territory as its own and to not be slowly be replaced by foreign races and ethnic groups through mass immigration.  What if Asian, African, Middle Eastern, Amerindian, Indian, Oceanic, Eurasian, etc. people hold the same sentiment?

Are the Native Americans \"nazis\" if they don't want European-Americans to move into their reservations in massive numbers?\n\nNow of course, since ethnic Europeans are not the native population of the USA, white nationalists don't have much of an argument in the USA and this can be considered a type of morally wrong sentiment, but those in Europe most certainly do have a legitimate case.\n\nHowever, my point here is that white supremacy &amp; white nationalism =/= national socialism.  Whenever a blogger or journalist uses this type of labeling it discredits their argument.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's look at the bigger picture before we hand out the \"nazi\" label. What did the nazis do? Let's see:  They committed a genocide against the Jewish ethno-racial group, they waged a war of territorial conquest to increase German territory and \"living space\" and they sought to commit the ethnic cleansing of the indigenous Slavic people of that conquered territory to make room for German settlers.\n\nThis is pretty egregious and very few people who get labeled \"nazis\" in the USA want anything resembling what the nazis did. Just because someone might have some small random similarity with the nazis doesn't earn them that label. If a white man loves the European beauty of his race and therefore tells his white daughter that he would prefer her to marry a white man and have white, European-looking children, that does not make him a nazi, not at all. If that is the case, then 99.999999% of white people who have ever lived where nazis.",

        "selftext": "Before I get to the meat of the argument. I'll just admit I am going to get a hell of a lot of flak for this and I'm fine with that, it is what it is, but I stand by this view.\n\nI'll also elaborate on why I've come to this conclusion and view, I'm a white South African. Just short of being born free (born in '93 a few months before Apartheid came to an end).\n\nThroughout my life so far I've been told repeatedly by different people, fellow South Africans and foreigners alike that I as a white South African regardless of my age am personally responsible for Apartheid and the colonisation of South Africa in 1652. This is also known as the \"original sin\". We're all supposedly \"born with it\" as our politicians including our president Cyril Ramaphosa has implied. Unless of course you are a black South African then you are born innocent of any historic wrongs despite them having committed genocide against each other this is known as the [Mfecane.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mfecane) Which no one uses as a means to condemn black South Africans like people do against white South Africans with Apartheid and Colonialism.\n\nWhile I understand the perspective from my fellow black South Africans, holding a grudge against me and my kind for what my forefathers did to their forefathers. I do not understand or respect the condemnation from white Americans, Australians, Canadians and New Zealanders in regards to South Africa's Apartheid and Colonialism. So I've decided to say fuck it... I've had enough and jumped on the decolonisation bandwagon as a big fuck you to those that keep up their grudges against white South Africans despite us righting the wrongs of Apartheid and Colonialism by giving up our country to black majority rule as was [demanded by the West in the 1980's to 1990's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Anti-Apartheid_Act).\n\nFor them to continue to this day point fingers at me and my people for Apartheid and white minority rule that ended in 1994 is very hypocritical based on the fact they STILL rule their countries while we no longer rule ours and haven't for almost 30 years now. They continue to rule their countries at the expense of their indigenous people. Why are white people ruling over North America, Australia, Canada and New Zealand? None of those countries were originally white. They are only white majority countries now because they killed off most of the indigenous people. South Africans, Rhodesians and Portuguese Angolans never did and therefore lost their countries as a result in the \"winds of change\" movement of the 1960's to 1990's.\n\nIf you look at South Africa and Rhodesia (current day Zimbabwe) they were expected and demanded to be returned to indigenous rule, India also returned to indigenous rule. Why has the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand escaped this? Did the decolonisation movement stop at South Africa? Why?\n\nI know this is a very unpopular opinion, a lot of people are going to hate my guts for it. But like I said. I've had enough of being equivalent to a \"Nazi\", it has happened far too many times now where a person has learned my South African identity and used Apartheid as a means to condemn me.\n\nLinks to random redditors and random people on the street that jumped onto their holier than thou high horse to hate white South Africans.\n\n[Death threats from some random Yank](https://www.reddit.com/r/RSA/comments/kuiy73/a_healthy_dose_of_racism_in_my_inbox/)\n\n[Random redditor takes it upon himself to generalise about white South Africans and Apartheid](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/kt2ygy/the_richest_man_in_the_world_is_now_an_african/gijqv2k/?context=3)\n\n[The perception of white South Africans by the US is negative.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/ktkzvf/meme_its_like_mayjuly_didnt_happen/ginvivz/?context=3)\n\n[British man in towel yells at white South African to fuck off back to South Africa and uses Apartheid as a means to disparage the South African.](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/12634328/racist-rant-south-african-builder-video/)\n\n[Elon Musk's white South African identity being used as a means to condemn him for being wealthy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/kt2ygy/the_richest_man_in_the_world_is_now_an_african/giji8cd/?context=3)\n\n[afrikaans = ultra racist, anarchist, genocidal, imperialist, right wing antecedents - according to deleted comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ksl6pf/elon_musk_dethrones_jeff_bezos_as_the_worlds/gihn8ru/?context=3)\n\n[White South Africans are not a minority according to this oke.

For people like these to get out their holier than thou attitude to shit all over me and my people while they still prosper in their countries that they colonised pisses me off to no end...\n\nWe did the right thing, voted to end Apartheid in 1992 which led to ANC majority rule in 1994. Yet to this day we cannot wash off the \"sin\" of Apartheid and being vestiges of Dutch and British colonialism. While Americans, Brits, Canadians, Australians and New Zealanders pretend their arses are clean and it is especially aggravating when they point fingers at white South Africans... Fucking hell if there is anything more hypocritical than that I don't want to know... People that committed genocide against their own indigenous people have the audacity to point fingers... The rationality is incomprehensible.\n\nThat's my rant for today... I know I'm going to piss off a lot of people especially those in the countries I am pointing fingers back at. But fuck it... It had to be said... Excuse my foul language I am pretty pissed off and feel kind of defeated. I wouldn't hold this opinion if I hadn't experienced these instances of condemnation at every corner. These experiences have shaped my negative view of the West. I see it as full to the brim of hypocrisy and actually wish to see it destroyed now. I understand it is a petty view to have. But when you are cornered and attacked from every direction for nothing other than your identity by people that have no moral high ground to attack from then this is what happens.",

        "selftext": "First of all let met begin by saying that this is NOT an argument to declare LeBron as the goat. This is strictly a point stating that the 4-6 argument is a bad one that should not be used when comparing the two athletes. \n\nNow, to be fair, I dont care about the whole but he got to the finals, Jordan didnt, argument either. What irks me about bringing up LeBrons finals record is that it leaves out so much context of his finals opponents. \n\nLeBrons finals opponents and overall difficulty were leagues ahead of Jordans, and anyone can see that. Besides Dallas, its not like LeBron played poorly in any of his finals losses, and Dallas is the only finals loss where you can truly blame LeBron. But lets run through them to double check:\n\n- 2007- San Antonio Spurs: A young LeBron carried a group of role players to the finals and had to face prime Duncan, Parker, Ginobili, with Pops still coaching, Spurs were heavy favorites already. \n- 2011- Dallas Mavericks: Again, this is the only finals I blame LeBron. Its fair to say he choked here, because he did.\n- 2014- San Antonio Spurs: LeBron probably couldve played better in these finals, but outside of Bosh, he got no help. His teammates were shooting ice cold bricks, Chalmers was no where to be seen, meanwhile the Spurs were shooting lights out. LeBron couldve dropped 40 a game in these finals and it wouldnt have changed the result. \n- 2015- Golden State Warriors: Love and Irving were injured for the entire series, and LeBron carried another group of role players to 6 games against a dominant team, and honestly probably shouldve won FMVP despite losing. His 2nd and 3rd best players this series were Matthew Dellavadova and Timofey Mozgov; think about that for a second.\n- 2017- Golden State Warriors: Imagine a 73-9 team adding the 2nd best player in the league. Thats just bs. Obviously their record was worse but they learned from the previous year not to treat every regular season game like game 7 of the finals. They easily couldve gone 75-7 if they wanted to. \n- 2018: Golden State Warriors. LeBron had just Kevin Love (who was dealing with injuries too) and a bunch of role players, one of which, forgot the score in game 1. And again, were facing almost the exact same team as the previous year. They shouldnt have even been in the finals this year. \n\nSo, to conclude, its absolutely not a good argument to bring up LeBrons finals record when comparing him to MJ, because of the context surrounding each of his finals. Now, I will end by saying this: LeBron may have had tougher competition *in* the finals, but Jordan may have had tougher competition *getting* to the finals. It just happened to be that when Jordan was playing, the east was the stronger conference, and when LeBron was playing, the west was the stronger conference. \n\nSo if you want to say Jordans 6 &gt; LeBrons 4, I take no issue with that. I may give counter arguments against it, but overall I dont mind that argument. If you want to say LeBron choked against Dallas, fine, just dont act like that was the only season of his career. What bugs me however, again, is saying Jordan is 6-0 while LeBron is 4-6. \n\nCMV!",

If a person has a perfect payment history, then its very likely that they are going to pay you back, since they have a perfect record of paying back others. Just because theyre using a lot of credit that theyve been extended, doesnt mean theyre unlikely to pay back, it just means that theyre using what theyve been offered. Personally, I have a great credit score, but I just dont carry a balance. My wife however, has an average credit score solely because she carries a high balance, though she has never missed a payment in the 5 years shes had credit. A bank looking at her score by itself might think shes only 70% likely to pay back, even though she has paid back 100% of the time. \n\nI cant really think of any reason why utilization should be a contributing factor. Some people say that it makes the person look like theyre desperate for money, but even if that is the case, if theyre always paying back on time, why does it matter?

Basically, she is in charge of all the police in London, and has been since 2017.\n\nVery recently, there was a murder in London that sent shockwaves through the wider community. Firstly, because it was of a young woman - reigniting the debate around the extent to which women are not safe in the streets. Secondly, because the perpetrator was a metropolitan police officer.\n\nIn response to this, a vigil was organised in the open green space of Clapham Common, that was entirely peaceful and fully followed all current and apt safety protocols. However in response, the Metropolitan Police refused to allow the protest to go ahead, and used extremely heavy handed tactics to attempt to prevent the incident. \n\nCressida Dick has previously overseen BLM protests, as well as protests by white nationalists and other groups. It seems difficult to argue that this protest was in some way unique and in need of prevention. There is no evidence of violence on the part of the vigil attendees prior to the police's arrival. They chose Clapham Common as their attendence site, a green space without businesses or infrastructure or other items to vandalise.\n\nAs far as can be seen, the only reason to prevent this protest is that it was in response to a crime committed by a police officer. Even if there was a more legitimate reason, the complete and utter failure to explain it means that Cressida Dick's actions have undermined confidence in the police to protect the right to protest.\n\nCressida Dick should resign, because it would demonstrate that the police realise that this incident has done too much to damage the view of the police in London. The people need to be able to trust the police, and thus they need to know that they have admitted their mistakes.\n\nThings that might change my view include\n- Demonstrating that the police had a good reason to prevent the protest, that is consistent with previous actions\n- Demonstrating that such a mistake is not serious enough to justify resignation, and providing/explaining an alternative response.",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI think that the debate on whether certain preferences constitute racist, transphobic, fatphobic, height descrimination, etc. in dating is confused, and could do with more clarity if we find out what we're talking about. In general, I think there are five (and maybe more) issues being confused in the debate:\n\n* Do these preferences in themselves suffice to be an implicit view that, say, trans women aren't women, or black people are uncivilized and rude, etc.? That is, is the preference sufficient and absolutely indicative of a transphobic/racist/etc. view?\n* Do these preferences indicate a disconnect between what we rationally know and how we actually act, in a cognitive dissonance kind of way? For example, one might say and usually act as though trans women are women, but their revulsion to dating trans women comes down to an inner, possibly unconscious belief, that trans women are not women.\n* Are the preferences 'valid', but the expression of them is not? For example, the idea that if approached by someone who you know is a transwoman, she should be refused and if providing a reason, you should lie and say it's not due to being trans. Similarly, is it wrong to write \"Cis women only\" or \"No asians\" on a dating profile?\n* Are the preferences usually and mostly simply a convenient way to express other preferences which are unrelated to trans/race issues? For example, the preference to have children, or the preference for someone with a shared cultural background.\n* Let's say that it is somehow an issue. What is the correct response to this? Is it a matter of personal discovery and reflection, a matter of personal morality that we ought to improve and work on, or is it a matter of public shame and condemnation? What should be the goal of calling people out on it? Does calling people out on it actually help fix the issue or prompt critical thinking, or does it mean they'll dig in their heels?\n\nThe debate can't continue unless it's specified which of these elements it's about. It also needs to be clarified what is meant by racist/transphobic/etc. and what it means to have a racist/transphobic/etc. preference.\n\nAs a matter of morality, there are already [reasons](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/mopp-2014-0023/html) to believe that certain preferences, and at least the expression of those preferences, is wrong. In particular, on \"racial looksism\":\n\n&gt;This response embodies a popular attitude that personal preferences or tastes are simply personal matters  they are not subject to moral evaluation. In this paper, I argue, against this popular attitude, that a personal preference like racial looksism is indeed wrong. A preference like racial looksism is wrong because it is an overgeneralization that disrespects individuality by treating people as exchangeable tokens of one type, and such disrespect denies its objects appreciation that their dignity entitles them to. As it turns out, there is on my account a relevant moral difference between racial looksism and simple looksism.\n\nIt has also been [argued](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/why-yellow-fever-isnt-flattering-a-case-against-racial-fetishes/96D2F19F052E8A2625968037BE756FEA) (quite convincingly) that the opposite is true; racial fetishes (such as 'yellow fever') are morally objectionable even if they are based on personal preference rather than admitted racist stereotypes.\n\nThis has also been extended to other realms where people are disadvantaged on a wide scale by 'just preferences', such as sexual orientation, gender identity, physique, and class. Rijnders [argues](https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/66020/Rijnders-2018-DevelopingMoralCharacter-PhD.pdf?sequence=1) (p. 161):\n\n&gt;I expand the debate beyond the focus on racial  preferences to address sexual preferences in general, provide a systematic overview of  the main arguments defending and criticising sexual preferences, and explore the  models of sexual cognition and theories of moral responsibility that are implicit in  these arguments. Secondly, I propose an understanding of sexual preferences as  attitudes in an agents character, which are interconnected with other attitudes, and  which allow for malleability. From this, I argue that we can best analyse the moral  status of sexual preferences by appreciating the various harms they can cause, and  evaluate agents moral responsibility in terms of the developmental control they have  over their preferences.\n\nIn which he later draws the analogy with friendship, and what we think of morality in that domain:\n\n&gt;While I agree that there are no moral  obligations to befriend, nor moral rights to a particular persons friendship, but that  friendship is governed by mutual voluntary choice, this does not eliminate the  possibility of discrimination. To illustrate, take the following scenario. *Susan is a  White woman of Western European heritage, who grows up with Abdel in the same  neighbourhood. In spite of their mutual appreciation for the others character, their  shared values, many common interests, and typically enjoyable experience of each  others company, Susan does not want to be friends with Abdel, because of his Middle Eastern descent, and her preference for only White friends.* (Race, in this example,  may be replaced by other traits, such as sexual orientation, gender identity, or body  type). **I take it that there are few people who would argue that, because friendship is a  free, voluntary matter, the choice to exclude people based on their race does not have  any moral substance.** Rather, since such preferences can cause harm, they have to be  justified, or else they are arbitrary, morally wrong, and even discriminative.\n\nA possible rejoinder might mention that the same argument applies to sexual orientation, that is, whether it's \"homophobic\" to be a straight man. The author addresses this:\n\n&gt;Firstly, the empirical data discussed in  section 2b, if studied more closely, only addresses sexual orientations, such as  homosexuality, as predetermined and unchangeable. This is where the theoretical  distinctions from section 1a become decisive, because these findings do not  straightforwardly warrant similar conclusions about sexual preferences being equally  fixed. **Not all of human sexuality can be reduced to the same mechanisms that may  govern sexual orientation.** \\[...\\]  In order to not make such unwarranted generalisations and avoid unintended support for harmful  conversion practices, **an adequately nuanced view of sexual development is needed, which is why I focus  exclusively on certain sexual preferences in this essay and leave the matter of sexual orientation and sexual  identity aside**. One point worth noting is that, while it may turn out that sexual orientation has a degree of fluidity too,  **since this is probably significantly less controllable than sexual preference fluidity, moral wrongness and  responsibility for sexual orientations cannot similarly be argued for on the basis of developmental control.**\n\nAnyway, my main point is that **I think this is a matter of morality (public and private morality), not just of 'personal preference', and that the heavy weight we attach to calling people 'racist' or 'transphobic' doesn't need to be so heavy. Further, the debate should be narrowed down and reformed along what people actually** ***do***\\*\\*, not just what their preferences are.\\*\\* It may not be as bad as racism or transphobia, but that doesn't mean there's *nothing* wrong with it. It also doesn't mean something *is* wrong with it.\n\nThanks for reading, and I'm interested to see what your views are!",

Would it be reasonable to ask them to get the tattoos removed? Of course not. \n\n\nThe same thing could be said of someone who has transitioned from one sex to another. If you have dated someone for a while, then at some point they inform you they were born the same sex as you and transitioned to the sex they are now, it is not discriminatory to have feelings that you really cant control that render this relationship incompatible and terminate it. It doesnt need to mean that you think anything less of them as a person. It means that something about them makes them unsuitable as a life partner. Would it be reasonable to chastise them for their life choices? Absolutely not.

The counter argument is that there might not be any women in the top division of a coed sports league. But I wonder why we're so sure about that. It's only in recent generations that women were even encouraged to play sports or had female role models who were athletes. Those who grew up under Title IX (1972) are only just recently starting to have children that are of ages eligible to compete professionally. As we continue to encourage and celebrate women in sports, I think the gap between men and women will be smaller than we think.\n\nLook at long-distance swimming for example where women significantly outperform men: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24584647/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24584647/). Our idea of men being to superior to women in sports is based partially in some biological trends between the genders, but it's also probably somewhat biased based on women's previous access to sports and the idea that sports weren't accepted as a viable career path for women.\n\nI can see how male/female sports were important early on in order to give women the visibility that they wouldn't have had otherwise, but at some point (maybe in a few generations / 50 years or less) I think integrating them would be a more powerful statement about the equality of women. And how cool and empowering would that story be if the next Megan Rapinoe is able to win a trophy in a league open to any human on the planet or the next Amanda Nunes is knocking out men in her weight class or to watch the next Sue Bird cross up the next Lebron?",

Prejudice.\n\nThis is nothing new, but this idea from what I have seen has gained mainstream traction; to say that all white people are inherently racist. Another; to assume that all white people are privileged, or that nuance doesnt exist. Ive seen these prejudice ideas perpetuated more and more. From my experience, there are many people, I would say even mostly other white people, who support these ideas. I remember a time when it was said that the left fought for people to be judged on the content of their character and not the color of their skin, but that doesnt seem to be the case anymore.\n\n2.) Culture.\n\nThis, from my experience, is relatively new; the political left aiming to disrupt the culture of foreign nations and peoples in order to adjust to their moral standards. Weve seen culture killing happen before where people have went to other countries by force in order to pressure the locals into adopting their norms, language and religion. This happened to American slaves, many African countries, the Native Americans. Yet the tables have flipped, and now youre part of the problem if you think that people who subscribe to the Quran should be able to have sexist cultural norms if they so desire. This was once referred to as the white mans burden. And that idea, of it being incumbent on Americans specifically to get up in arms about the cultural norms of foreign people to pick up and carry the uncivilized people is living on today. And I think that is wrong. I think that being civilized is perspective, and we should not be getting involved in that sort of stuff. Leave them be.\n\nThere are many other cases, but I dont want this to turn into an essay.\n\nThe point here is that my view is that politics in horse-shoeing. I think that the political left has gone off the rails and is destined to devolve into fascism just like the right did.

        "selftext": "Im sick and tired of Democrats exploiting black suffering to make political gains.\n\nThey love to call conservatives racist despite Liberals clear history of opposing civil rights and supporting the Ku Klux Klan, even nominating Klan members to SCOTUS and the Senate (Klansman Byrd even served until 2010). Ever since the 1964 civil rights bill was passed (after countless attempts by the GOP to pass the bill, shot down by liberals each time) democrats have tried to turn around and act like the saviors of black America. LBJs great society stomped on black Americans and totally reversed the progress that black people were making ON THEIR OWN. Democrats thought the federal government had to come and save blacks when they were doing just fine on their own, and as a result democrats screwed them over horribly. Democrats white savior complex not only insinuated that black Americans were incapable of success even after enduring all they have, but this led to policies that actively HARMED black Americans and reversed the progress they were making on their own merit.  \n\nThe conservative platform was to fight for the freedom of black America and then let them compete with the best of us freely. The liberal platform was to deny civil rights as long as they could, but when blacks finally got the right to vote then theyd throw imposing government programs at them to trap them into government reliance to win more democratic voters. If blacks are gonna vote, theyre gonna vote for us! Democrats prioritized winning votes over helping black Americans. \n\nDemocrats want to use black communities as lab rats for defunding police strategies even though its shown to lead to more crime and therefore more black people dying. Theyre okay risking the lives of black families in order to try out a social experiment dreamed up in a sociology class despite the data showing it causes more death and crime! How many times does history need to show the disaster of liberal crime policy?\n\nLiberals treat blacks like whales for goodness sake! Theyre like save the whales! While not allowing black Americans to have any responsibility or agency for themselves. Liberals think they know whats best: blacks need the federal government to come in and save them by throwing money at them and not punishing them for crime. But every intervention Democrats have implemented have just stifled black progress and set them further back than they already were. Once conservatives won legal equality for blacks, black Americans didnt need the federal government swooping down to give them benefits; they were quite capable of reaching success on their own. \n\nAnd Im tired of Democrats expressing this moral superiority with racism despite their dark history of supporting the KKK and segregation. And even today the way that they treat black conservatives is abhorrent! Conservative blacks are a huge threat to the Democratic establishment because liberals argument for everything is thats racist. They try to get around it by calling black conservatives Uncle Tom and saying theyre still racist against their own race but at that point even soccer moms can tell theyre full of crap. Look at the way the New York Times treated Charlie Wrangle, or the way the RNC treated Gov Patterson, or how  they treated Roland Burris. They didnt make Donna Brazil head of the DNC despite her stellar experience. I dont like Democrats but she was the smartest mind they had. The way theyve treated Justice Clarence Thomas is just evil! They have banned his works of brilliant literature from platforms like Amazon! Hes a major threat to the Democrats as he totally disses the way white liberals try to be the savior of blacks while their strategies just end up hurting blacks more. Thomas wants these white liberals to leave his community alone.  Or look at how Democrats treated GOP candidate Herman Cain libeling him for sexual assault during the 90s where everything was considered sexual harassment (like a woman who accused her boss of sexual harassment and won a huge settlement because he had a picture of his wife in a bathing suit on his desk). Or even how they went after Condaleeza Rice (she was called dumb constantly by liberals and even blamed for 9/11).\n\nTheres dumb racists on both sides, but democrats are the ones pushing policies that actively hurt black people while minimizing the black experience by exploiting civil rights to pass every policy they want. The goal of the civil rights amendments were very clear.  To get a constitutional Amendment passed, there must be a mass feeling for a big problem. The sole and exclusive purpose of 13th-15th amendments were to stop Democrats from nullifying the entire civil war by continuing to deny citizenship rights to the newly freed slaves. This was not to ensure that every pregnant Mexican would win citizenship for themselves and their family for popping out a baby in America, or to allow doctors to stick forks in babys skulls, or to give the right to gays to marry and sodomize, or to allow governments to give welfare to illegal aliens, or to prohibit voting ID laws... etc etc. It was to PROTECT FREED SLAVES. Democrats totally dismantled these special amendments intended to protect blacks and exploited their suffering to pass their wishlist policies. The Democratic playbook is to call every policy proposal a civil rights issue so they can scream RACIST at anyone who disagrees with the policy. They exploit black suffering, use blacks as lab rats, and then cry racism to everyone they disagree with. Im over it!",

        "title": "CMV: Covid was an accident from the lab in Wuhan, and the Chinese government is covering it up.",
        "selftext": "Ok. This is a bit of a novel, but I'm a recent traveler taking my quarantine really seriously and thus have lots of time to think. Please, wise people of the internet, help me understand why my analysis is wrong. Or, help me understand why the conclusion I reach is misguided, meaningless, or missing a larger point. I'll start with what I think we can all agree on.\n\nThe first known cases of Covid appeared in the city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China. As of now, it makes sense to say that COVID originated in the city of Wuhan (this is widely accepted). A wet market in downtown Wuhan was the first super spreader event that let the world know about the pandemic. Although initially suspected as being the source of the pandemic, it is now better understood as simply the first cluster of cases.  As for finding \"patient zero\", it appears up to 174 people have been identified in the very early stages of the pandemic from various parts of the city, many with no connection to the first super spreader event. It seems likely that the first human infection from Covid was between September and November of 2019, somewhere in the city of Wuhan. Unfortunately, that's about all we know. From the Wall st. Journal:\n\n\n\"Many of the 174 cases had no known connection to the market that was initially considered the source of the outbreak, according to information gathered by WHO investigators during the four-week mission to China to examine the origins of the virus. Chinese authorities declined to give the WHO team raw data on these cases and potential earlier ones, team members said.\"\n\n\nSo we are left wondering two things. Number 1: which of the 174 people was, or was in contact with, patient zero? Number 2: what is the justification, or the reason, for China with-holding raw data on early covid infections from a team of scientists trying to figure out the origin of the virus? It strikes me that vaccine manufacturers were able to find a vaccine at an unprecedented speed because of the gravity of the situation. It also strikes me that finding the origin of this virus could have that same level of importance, if not speed, if only the Chinese government treated it as such.  Other than the vaccine, what could possibly be more important? Would we accept this sort of coverup from the Canadian, American, or UK governments?\n\nAt this point, I feel that every reasonable person should feel upset with the Chinese government. They are inexplicably uncooperative on this matter of life and death. However, I understand if people won't follow me down this next path. The thing is, I'm not a paranoid person. I'm always the person at the dinner table just calmly pointing holes in the paranoid person's arguments.  But have a listen to what I have to say. \n\n\nI don't have the requisite scientific background to understand virology or epidemiology at a high level. So my thinking is only along the lines of basic detective work. Detectives like evidence, and don't like coincidences. They especially don't like when coincidences could be explained were evidence not being withheld by a party who might have a whole lot to lose by doing so.\n\nThe first known cluster of cases occurred at the wet market approximately 200 meters away from the WIV. Now, the proximity of the first known cluster of cases to the WIV doesn't necessarily mean anything. I know that. It seems strange, but unless the WIV employees were regularly visiting the market it is meaningless, and indeed just a coincidence. However, this doesn't calm me. Why that freakin wet market and not some other place? If you looked at places in Wuhan with the potential to be superspreader locations (lots of foot traffic, high density with lots of shared air), how many of those locations would we find? My intuition is we would find thousands.\n\nI think we can all agree that if the wet market was 200 meters away a cave of bats known to harbour coronaviruses, we would all be super fucking suspicious. So perhaps we need to think about the fact that there is only one, ONE laboratory in all of mainland China that is known to collect, store, and perform risky gain of function research on bat coronaviruses. In a country with 1.4 billion people spread across 9.597 million km², the first super spreader event just happened to fall within 200 meters of this place. As far as coincidences go, that is completely unbelievable. There are 102 cities in China with &gt;1 million residents. There are hundreds of thousands of towns and villages. So not only did this happen to take off in the city that has the only batlab (that on it's own is a red flag), but in a city with 10 million inhabitants and 8,494 km² in area, it takes off 200 meters, METERS, from the batlab.  Not some pub on the other side of town. Not a senior heavy apartment complex. Not a rec center. It was the market by the batlab. The place where WIV people probably go to get their endangered rhino horn and other exotic treats from the sex organs of disappearing species before going in to work. And I DO think they probably went to that market, and this exactly how the pandemic started.\n\nAnyone that thinks this was intentional in any way is barking up the wrong tree. I don't think that. It makes no sense. What I think is that we are looking at China's version of the Chernobyl accident. I think that makes a lot of sense. It makes sense of the wet market - lab coincidence, and it makes sense of the Chinese government's behavior. If someone with an expertise in this area can point out the flaws in my thinking that would be great.",

Many problems in the world stem from stupidity, why not get rid of it? \n\nArtificially altering and speeding up the course of natural selection towards a smarter species doesn't seem like a bad idea to me. One problem I see is that it would be inhumane not to allow certain people to start a family and live a fulfilled life based on something they have no control over. But honestly, a smarter world would in the long run run smoother with less drama, and probably increase net happieness. Does that outcome outweigh a few generations of suffering for the affected people?\n\nI'm mostly interested in challenging the philosophical complications of this and not necessarily how it would be practically implemented (underpopulation etc).

Human beings are inherently predatory and selfish, and we essentially use the corpses of other people as a way of elevating ourselves. Wherever there are human beings, there will always be suffering.\n\nSo, with all that being said, why in the ever loving FUCK would you give birth to a child for any reason other than pure selfishness, when you can instead just not box them into a situation where they quite literally can't escape (because of aspects like the fear of death)? Especially given how not being alive has virtually no downside, since the person quite literally isn't even alive to experience anything.\n\nI know there are many responses which are going to go something along the lines of \"well, it's quite possible they could live a good life aswell!\". However, that never really made much sense to me. It would be like throwing someone into the depths of the ocean without any scuba gear, with their chances of drowning being very high, and using the excuse of \"well, they could come back up with sunken treasure!\"\n\nStatistically, most people aren't going to be happy. There are cases where people get raped and assaulted. There are cases where people are born into war-torn countries. There are cases where people are LGBT and suffer discrimination/oppression (and dysphoria as a bonus if you're trans). I'm not going to bother continue listing them out, since quite honestly I think we all get the point. Life isn't fair, and justice is a privilege rather than a right.\n\nGiving birth to a child and forcing them into a world like this cannot be justified through any reason besides the self-gratification it grants you as a parent. Especially given how most parents tend to treat their kids like property and pets rather than actual human beings.

        "selftext": "My view is quite simple. The purpose of school is to teach kids things. So, I'd say that reading assignments in school is objectively a good thing because you can learn a shit ton from reading whether you enjoy it or not. But choosing what books teenagers are reading is just as important as making them read in the first place. The things teenagers can learn from books are:\n\n1. Reading comprehension\n2. Important themes/messages (Ideas that we could take away from a book and use in our own life)\n3. How to enjoy reading (and keep the habit in the future)\n\nThough preferably the book selected would teach all three, I think at least 2 would suffice. The books in the title and many others fit only one or don't fit any of the requirements I've given.\n\n Considering that the most common opinions on these books from teenagers are at least unenthusiastic, I don't think they fulfill requirement 3. I'm sure some teens enjoyed them, but not enough to cater to. \n\nThey surely don't fulfill requirement 2, at least not to the extent that other books can. Like yeah the main morale of the Odyssey was to not be too prideful. That is a good thing to know. However, there are countless other books that demonstrate this message in a more relevant and impactful way. Pretty much nobody is going to read about how Odysseus angered a sea god and gave away his name by boasting and think about it the next time they get cocky. From Macbeth we learn that power corrupts. Once again, that message just isn't demonstrated in a way as relevant to today or as powerfully as other books can. \n\nMost of them fulfill requirement 1. If you read pretty much anything that isn't 1 Fish 2 Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (still love that book tho) then your reading comprehension will improve. I still think reading shakespeare requires unnecessary effort in the comprehension skills it returns though. Like yeah you will improve at reading shakespeare specifically, but that just isn't important for the vast majority of people. \n\nJust saying this is not an attack on your favorite books. I really enjoyed reading many classics and I think all of them have value. I just don't think some of them are appropriate for school. I'd also like to know what are some other books people think should be taken off the highschool reading list. The ones I gave  above are the most egregious examples, but I really think ones like Great Expectations, Romeo and Juliet, and To Kill a Mockingbird should be removed as well. Whether you think my ideas on the purpose of school, the reasons to read books, or the learning value from some are skewed, I welcome all opinions. Thanks in advance for your responses.",

        "selftext": "  \n\nSo, I was recently reading [this really interesting article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/15/what-is-happening-to-the-republicans) and while I dont agree with all the conclusions, there was one little factoid that really struck me. The Republican Party has only once won the popular vote in a Presidential election since 1988. \n\nWow. 1988. The world was totally different then. That was when the Soviet Union was still very much a thing and the internet very much not a thing. Way before most of the people reading this were born. That cant be very comforting to Republicans. \n\nAnd that got me to thinking, do they even care? Im pretty sure they dont. Now, I know that the popular vote is essentially just icing on the cake, it has absolutely no bearing on who wins American Presidential elections, but I always just assumed that political parties in a democracy want to attract a majority of people to their side. But then it hit me. The Republican Party of today has pretty much decided if you like what they are selling theyre happy to have you, but they are not going to change the packaging to suit anyone whos not one of their current customers.\n\nAnd what are they selling? It goes like this, vote for us and well stick it to those stuck-up snobs who think that they know whats best for everyone!. Thats really what it all boils down to. They dont really do that much but they sure do try to make the libs cry! Turns out that is an incredibly popular message for about a pretty big chunk of Americans! Like 70 million!\n\nAnd it also turns out that its completely repulsive to an even bigger chunk. But the Republicans have decided that they are going to be there for that rather sizeable portion of Americans who likes what theyre selling, and the majority can just suck it. \n\nThis is why they are actively trying to [reduce the numbers of people who vote](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/opinion/us-voting-rights-republicans.html), in the name of electoral integrity, of course. This is why they are increasingly making the argument that [the US is not a democracy](https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/08/america-is-not-a-democracy-and-we-dont-want-it-to-be/), which is of course true but it has been regularly described as a democracy by leaders of both parties and all over the world for over 100 years. And this is why theres a lot of push on the right to [defend the electoral college](https://townhall.com/columnists/christalgo/2020/11/03/democrats-despise-electoral-college-because-it-empowers-small-states-and-rural-voters-n2579277), which was kind of forgotten about for much of American history because until now the winner of the popular vote and the electoral vote almost always lined up. \n\nSo, if you can change my view about this, please do. Its hardly an original opinion anyway. But I would also like to know, is what they are up to is necessarily a bad thing? \n\nI mean, I dont support the GOP, but I can see how their current approach to politics might be very satisfying and even comforting to someone who does. They are representing their base and they sure as hell arent going to compromise! And unlike the Democrats who are for the American worker and neoliberalism, standing up to corporate wealth and bailing out big banks, a sensible defense budget and an interventionist foreign policy, raising the minimum wage and not raising the minimum wage (yes, Im being facetious) the Republicans are actually kind of starting to be consistent. \n\nAm I missing something here?",

In particular, overcoming a talking filibuster would cost the majority time, probably a week or several weeks of the Senate being unable to do anything else, as well as the bill in question being at the center of national attention (since it would be a huge spectacle to have the Senate doing a 24h talkathon).\n\nRealistically, this could be done once or twice a year maximum, so almost all legislation would still need supermajority support.  But if you're willing to put your chips down and spend that time on it, you should be able to pass it with a majority.\n\nLikewise, the minority party would have more incentive to make a meaningful deal, because their position is strong enough to get concessions, but not so strong as to think they don't need to make concessions of their own.

I strongly believe this is self-explanatory. Despite all cries and hard-work towards achieving equality that is being done today, the draft is rarely ever mentioned. Wars are obviously very violent, and having only men participate in wars deems them as expendable. Exactly four countries have gender-neutral draft, while all others that still draft only draft men. Biologically speaking, men ARE expendable, but the population is in the billions and having women fight no longer risks the complete wipe-out of a tribe. I feel like it needs to be said that I am completely the idea of the draft as a whole but the way ot is today normalizes violence against men.\n\nSecondly, the media coverage of male deaths. Men make up about 77%[77%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/251877/murder-victims-in-the-us-by-race-ethnicity-and-gender/) of homicide victims, yet most media coverage relating to deaths is not about the deaths of men. I in no way mean to take away from the severity of anyone's death, but when the majority of violence is in reality against men yet if an alien from another planet watched the news this would not seem like the case, it proves my point.\n\nThirdly, domestic violence and rape against men is pretty much a joke. In fact, it is literally portrayed as comedy in movies and shows including cartoons (a lady looks at a shy/confused guy suggestively, and then jumps on him as the camera cuts away). Not to mention, if u search DV expirements against men and against women, people laugh when they see a woman hitting a man. There is almost no support at all for male DV victims shelter-wise and awareness-wise (posters and commercials and the like).\n\nFourthly, homelessness. Most homeless people are men, yet women gain prioritization in sheltering. Men sleeping hungry and cold is more acceptable than the same happening for women. Had the genders been flipped the givernment would be working day and night to fix the problem.\n\nFifthly, work-related deaths. Men are [10 times as likely](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/chuckdevore/2018/12/19/fatal-employment-men-10-times-more-likely-than-women-to-be-killed-at-work/amp/) to die from work-related deaths than women, and then again no awareness abouy this at all. Once again, had the genders been flipped, governments would be working day and night to fix the problem.\n\nI could go on but I think my point has been made. Thank you for reading my post and please keep in mind that I am making this post with the sole purpose of having my mind changed against this matter.",

        "selftext": "People are born.  Yes, there is an instinct to reproduce, supposedly, but there is lust and attraction that goes into sexuality.  People are not attracted to the first person they see.  We are attracted to a person that we find attractive.  For 'straights', that usually means an attractive member of the opposite sex.  But why are they attracted.  Our media has for the past centuries, shown heterosexual relationships.  This comes from biblical tradition.  The Bible explains that we are to be in a relationship with a member of the opposite sex, implying that being homosexual is a choice.  Homosexuality was not uncommon back then - just read about Rome.  But seeing as some animals display homosexual behavior, there is a possibility that it was based on experience and attraction, and less so biological wiring.",

        "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying trans people arent some mentally ill crazy people, and they also arent just looking for attention, but there are definitely some people out there who are just doing it to be different. \n\nImagine having to go through gender dysphoria daily, come out to the people you love who are unsupportive, deal with how society rejects you, how youre whole identity is political, how strangers stare at you, how hard it is finding love as a transgender person, losing partners because of it, etc. etc. and then someone goes, Yeah Im genderqueer, I dont experience dysphoria or anything but I dont like wearing womens fashion so Im trans too. \n\nIt amazes me how many non-binary female assigned at birth people fit 90% of womens gender roles but dont shave their armpits or like to wear overalls so theyre apparently not women anymore. \n\nI think this is so damaging to real trans people who actually deal with the real mental, physical and societal effects of actually being transgender. I go to a regular liberal university in a big city and there are so many of these people here.  None of these people would be trans if they were in college in 2015 instead of 2021. Its literally just trendy and used to make them feel unique and not like other girls.  They literally fit into 90+% of female gender stereotypes, dont deal with dysphoria at all, and act exactly like any other 19 year old girl acts. Its literally a fashion statement. And these people make it so easy for anti trans activists. Theres so much material for them to use against actual trans people and accuse them of being trendy or doing it for attention. Deciding to not shave your arm pits at the age of 19 does not mean you suddenly change genders, especially if you fulfill and play out almost every other role your gender has. Its incredibly harmful. \n\nAnyway, feel free to change my mind.",

        "selftext": "I'll start off by saying I've used cryptos. I've used Bitcoin back when it was still used on the darknet, but use stuff like Monero nowadays as most/all platforms have moved to it. I dont mine btc, but I know a decent bit about how they work (and how much energy they use).\n\nI've been facing a ton of people on multiple platforms who seem 100% sure bitcoin will become the global currency. And it's gotten even worse recently since the value has skyrocketed the past month. It's worst on twitter, as I believe people are just searching terms like bitcoin and crypto. I'm a nobody on twitter and will get replies to [my tweets like these](https://imgur.com/a/dbZzHG1). All of them have crypto as their entire profile, and don't seem to be pushing a random alt-coin or anything sketchy like that. Those were just the first 4 replies.\n\nIt's always been insane to me people think crypto will be the biggest currency. It's confusing - It took me an hour to explain the idea of Blockchain to my mother. While my generation and younger is fairly technologically literate, a majority of young people likely have no clue what the fuck bitcoin is and likely don't care. \n\nThe price fluctuates constantly. I feel like it should be treated as closer to a stock. It's price based purely on USD. There are high transaction fees at times being $xx.xx per transaction, making small transactions ridiculous. Plus, there are long delays on confirmations unless you fork over a lot of money. If it were to replace something like the USD, it would require both parties to be connected to the internet and have a device they're able to pay with. There's just so many things that just make it seem insane that some people out there really believe that it'll be huge. And, the whole idea of it being anonymous isn't even completely true, which is why dark net markets haven't used BTC in a long time. There are many objectively better cryptos out there anyways, the only the BTC has is that it's the most well known.\n\nAnd reading through a lot of threads about crypto is just PAINFUL. It's like WSB except they think they're actually smart. \n\nI don't know how much of the is CMV or ELI5, but I cannot wrap my head around BTC getting as big as some of these crypto heads think it will.",

        "selftext": "Many consequences of the sexual revolution including greater acceptance of unusual gender identities and sexual preferences, greater access to birth control and abortion are things that most religions find abhorrent and sinful. Many people choose to pursue those sexual paths rather than conform to a religion that says what they are tempted to do in the bedroom is a sin.\n\nBecause of the hyper individualism merged with capitalism that comes from catered Netflix lists, Facebook feeds and Spotify playlists, more and more people want the world to conform to them and not vice versa. So, they often expect the same thing from religion, which has led to some churches turning into Christian rock concerts with very different doctrinal interpretations than what they professes a couple decades ago. In trying to appeal more to people who don't like religion as much, they lose their parishioners who were their core base to begin with.\n\nHowever, there are many religions which decide to stick to their doctrine and thus lose activity or membership because they don't support gay marriage.\n\nAdd moral relativism, shortened attention spans and a growing population of people who would rather pursue their own pleasure on a holy day when the higher power they can't appreciate because they view a relationship with it as very transactional, and you have a world that values religion less. If they do have a religion, they want it to lull them into a sense of false security telling then that they're good people, not to tell them that they might be sinning and can have eternal consequences for it, mich like the drugs and alcohol they use on the regular.\n\n\"If God didn't prevent my dad from dying of cancer, whats the point of worshipping him anyway if he doesn't give me what I need when I want it?\"",

        "selftext": "Let's define some terms first-\n\n **Guilt** is an [emotional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion) experience that occurs when a person [believes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief) or [realizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding)accurately or notthat they have compromised their own standards of conduct or have violated universal [moral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality) standards and bear significant [responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_responsibility) for that violation.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_(emotion)#cite_note-1) Guilt is closely related to the concept of [remorse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remorse) as well as [shame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame). \n\nAnd so it is, as defined by many other dictionaries in a similar way as well.\n\n **Pride** is a positive emotional response or attitude to something with an intimate connection to oneself, due to its perceived value. This may be one's own abilities or achievements, positive characteristics of friends or family, or one's country. \n\n **Glory-**\n\n**a:** something that secures praise or renown\n\n**b:** a distinguished quality or asset\n\nAs the Merriam-Webster defines it.\n\nNow that we've defined the terms, we have a clear image in our minds on what they exactly mean, so let's jump into the argument now-\n\nFrom how much I've talked to people from the right(I'm NOT a leftist either, just an auth-centrist), the kind of discourse I've seen coming from western nations, particularly the US will probably reach most of its audiences in the following words after all that's happened last year including the racial divide in the US and the BLM movement-\n\nAntagonist-\"White people should take responsibility for how much harm they've caused to the black community and POC\"\n\nRight/Evangelicals-\"What kind of fallacious logic is that, guilt is not an inheritable entity or something that can be passed on! I shouldn't be punished for my father's or grandfather's sins, Jesus has already paid for them!\"\n\nAntagonist-\"The system has been stuck in a vicious cycle of being systemically racist against us since  the very beginning, the founding fathers didn't include us well into the country's ethos, you're not doing a very good job either, I do not feel very comfortable around you\"\n\nRight/Evangelicals-\"That's because you don't assimilate into the ethos of the country very well, no there's no systemic racism, there are just a few bad apples here and there, also no, the founding fathers could never be wrong, whatever they created, the document called our constitution shall be eternally relevant, You don't feel comfortable, now that's an emotional appeal, but since you don't have your facts right, I don't think what you're saying matters, facts don't care about your feelings!\"\n\nAntagonist- \"Well at least then we sure could reform the system to be better, for the common citizen, for them to get better healthcare at a lower cost, for them to be able to afford their kids good education at even public schools and for the POCs to be able to equalize with the majority anglo populace of this country\"\n\nRight/Evangelicals-\"What do you mean reform? We already have the best system in the world!\"\n\nAntagonist-\"Well, I thinks the nords do better, they have cheaper healthcare, much more reporting rate in terms of crime, better education opportunities and a faster justice system than us, and all of this at a cheaper price for the common man as per his/her ability to afford\"\n\nRight/Evangelicals-\"They're social welfarists, that reeks of leftism, I'd rather have my fast food freedom!\"\n\nAnd that is how this endless discourse goes, but anyway, we've covered what's relevant for us until now, so let's get into it-\n\n(To be noted, the reason I've labeled the opposing person as an antagonist here is because the Right shall be the central point of our argument here)\n\n&gt;What kind of fallacious logic is that, guilt is not an inheritable entity or something that can be passed on! I shouldn't be punished for my father's or grandfather's sins\n\nNote, that the protagonist doesn't consider an emotional state of mind as something that should be passed on for the future generations to bear responsibility, in a tone \"Although my great-grandfather was a slave trader of black people, yet I shouldn't be held responsible for it, or even introspect on the matter as a member of the white majority of America since guilt's not something that can be passed on,don' t punish me for him!\"\n\nAlso note that the same person goes on to say-\n\n&gt;Jesus has already paid for them!\n\nThat's two contradictory statements, an emotional state, that is not genetically inheritable(top to bottom in a pedigree chart) and is only considered the responsibility of one man via the protagonist shall not be passible sideways to other people who've no blood relations to the protagonist sideways whatsoever as well.\n\nBottom line- If you can't bear the responsibility for your grandfather's sins then your sins haven't even been paid for by Jesus or any other as claimed son or nephew or god's own pet either, no matter how many times you crucify them, and what does that render the justice system?irrelevant?\n\nBut anyway, let's assume, for the benefit of doubt of the protagonist, that he/she is not an evangelical, or religious as a matter of fact, how should we go about it then?\n\nEven the irreligious-right would agree on this in particular-\n\n&gt;What kind of fallacious logic is that, guilt is not an inheritable entity or something that can be passed on! I shouldn't be punished for my father's or grandfather's sins\n\nMost people stop here and regard this as logically at the first sight of it, and then the irreligious protagonist, as most discourses of the kind show also goes on to say either of the follow-\n\n&gt;1.We have one of the best systems in the world bestowed upon us by our forefather/founding fathers  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2.Ours is a good system, what do we really need to change? Our forefathers laid a good foundation for us that's eternal  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. We're one of the best civilizations on the planet, one of the most successful, we should be grateful and proud of our forefathers for giving us their teachings and this civilization  \n&gt;  \n&gt;4. Our civilization is one of the most glorious of all, and all the pomp and show of gratitude goes to our forefather,glory to them!  \n\nThe same irreligious right still agrees to the notion, without acknowledging it that somehow, emotional states like pride and glory are passible from top to bottom generations in a pedigree chart, and somehow not being proud of your country on certain issues becomes a taboo imposed on the people who want improvements in the system and a better life for the poor.\n\n[Tu quoque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque) at best, because there resides an element of hypocrisy in the statements by the right in general, an attempt at trying to avoid responsibility for its past wrongs yet embracing the other positive emotional states with open hands, because if one emotional state of mind isn't inheritable because it is unappealing and saddening to you, so goes the same for all other kinds of emotional states of mind no matter how appealing they might sound.  If you don't want to embrace responsibility for the wrongs your forefathers did with certain communities in the past, you don't get to embrace their glory and pride for your ancestry and the country's systemic heritage either.\n\nIt's as simple as that, you can't have your cake and eat it too or should I say, one doesn't become a warrior without befriending the battle scars if one would like to put it that way. And that is what's the gist of my argument.Period.",

        "selftext": "Okay, Im a center-right moderate Conservative, and Ive watched with growing disillusionment and anger as the airwaves are dominated by the right shouting Libtards! and Socialists! while the left shouts Trumpster! and Racists!. I cant stand it. I cant figure out why the middle ground has evaporated between both parties, to where no moderate figures can maintain a political path where they cross party lines. The left calls Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin traitors constantly for not jumping on board instantly with the current agenda targets they have set. The Republicans call Senators Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney RINOs for their periodic support of Democratic programs and policies. Its maddening, and its turned into the extreme elements of both sides engaging in ideological terrorism against any and all who oppose their chosen agendas. \n\nThere is significant room for compromise on both sides of most issues. Ive chosen the top vote-getting issue from [Political Issues of 2021 (isidewith.com)](https://www.isidewith.com/polls) from each of 6 categories (Social, Education, Domestic, Economic, Immigration, Environmental) to show the large amount of crossover that each of these issues actually enjoys between both parties to show that there is common ground to be found. I would have done more, but this would have been an endlessly long post if I included more and more issues.\n\n**Social:** Abortion Rights.\n\n[Abortion Trends by Party Identification (gallup.com)](https://news.gallup.com/poll/246278/abortion-trends-party.aspx)\n\nDemocratic voters do not, by majority, prefer abortion rights under *any* circumstances. Per Gallup polling, 42% of Democratic voters support abortion rights under certain circumstances, and 8% support it being illegal in all circumstances. 49% support abortion in *all* circumstances, but this is still behind the sum total of voters who want some restrictions or who dont want any abortions.\n\nRepublican voters, on the other hand, only support legal in all circumstances at a rate of 13%. They support special circumstances at 59%, and illegal in all circumstances at 27%. \n\nIndependent voters support legal in all circumstances at 26%, illegal in all circumstances at 23%, and special circumstances at 50%.\n\nGiven these numbers, it is completely unwise for either party to pursue a strict policy of no limitations or outright illegality for abortion. It also is not representative of the public at large for smaller sections for the parties to advocate for a one-size-fits-all strategy where there is full access or no access. This, to me, furthers the vitriol and discord of the discussion. I can completely get behind special exceptions. As soon as I do, however, it becomes an enormous argument where I have to defend my gender and race and role in society, and all it makes me do is dig my heels in on my position. \n\n**Education:** Student Loan Forgiveness.\n\n[100-Day-Docket-Policy-Poll-Memo.pdf (defendstudents.org)](https://www.defendstudents.org/news/body/docket/100-Day-Docket-Policy-Poll-Memo.pdf) \\- Page 5\n\nThis one kind of surprised me with the results I found. Republican voters, at a rate of 58%, favor some form of student loan forgiveness. I do, as well. My wife was a school teacher in a lower-income school district for her first 4 years of teaching. She was challenged with resources, made lousy pay (started at $26k per year), and had to deal with a host of issues that were very difficult at times. She should have received some form of student loan forgiveness, based on her choosing to work in a lower-income school district, but the state we were in at that time did not have that program. I can get behind people receiving student loan forgiveness who endeavor to work in lower-income areas in a variety of degrees and fields of work. I support federal partnerships in certain industries to encourage this. I dont, however, support AOCs railing about her $20k in student loan debt. She was from NYC and went to Boston University, which is out of state, *by choice*. The taxpayer should have no obligation to someone who makes the decision to go to a more expensive school. She also makes $183k a year now as a sitting member of Congress, which she was successfully elected to partly as a result of her degree (only 24 members of Congress dont have a Bachelors Degree).\n\nDemocrats support some form of loan forgiveness at 78%. I couldnt find the independent voters statistics, but if 58% of Republicans and 78% of Democrats support the program, there should be ample room for discussion on the topic, without one side approaching it with a winner-take-all or dont-give-an-inch mentality. Im not for a tyranny of the minority, but I am also not for shutting down any objections and discussions just because a party holds 50 Senate seats.\n\n**Domestic:** Supreme Court Reform.\n\n[Plurality Says High Court Ideological Makeup 'About Right' (gallup.com)](https://news.gallup.com/poll/320798/plurality-says-high-court-ideological-makeup-right.aspx)\n\nI think this one has lost some steam, especially with Senators Manchin and Sinema coming out against it. However, it was incredibly divisive and concerning when it became an election issue, and with some parties still talking about it.\n\nRepublican voters, at a rate of 48%, say the courts ideological makeup is About Right, with 44% saying it is Too Liberal and 3% saying Too Conservative. With only 4% differentiating About Right and Too Liberal, it would seem Republicans are somewhat split on the court as a whole.\n\nDemocratic voters say About Right at 28%, Too Liberal at 12%, and Too Conservative at 58%. Obviously there are issues from their perspective, but they have still had victories in the form of the upholding of the ACA, *Carpenter v. United States*, *South Dakota v. Wayfair*, *Sessions v. Dimaya* and others, just since 2018.\n\nIndependent voters say About Right at 48%, Too Liberal at 16%, and Too Conservative at 32%. It would seem that the Independents line up against expanding the court, seeing as the plurality says the courts current makeup is about right.\n\nThis, to me, is indicative of the all-or-nothing mentality that the party bases are engaging in. When Chief Justice Roberts sided with the liberal faction for the ACA, Conservatives called him a traitor. When the Court Justices didnt allow President Trump success in his lawsuits, the sky was falling and they were part of the swamp. Neither side is truly happy, but that, to me, means it is probably working properly.\n\n**Economic:** Minimum Wage Requirements\n\n[Broad, Bipartisan Support for $1.9 Trillion Stimulus Package Persists as Senate Gears Up to Tackle Bill (morningconsult.com)](https://morningconsult.com/2021/03/03/coronavirus-stimulus-voter-support-bipartisan/) (Its about halfway down the page)\n\nDemocrats support raising the minimum wage at 63% for $15, 24% for $11, and 7% for no change. Thats 87% for at least an $11 minimum wage increase. \n\nRepublicans support raising the minimum wage at 16% for $15, 35% for $11, and 40% for no change. Its still a majority of 51% to raise it to $11, so theres room for a conversation on this between the parties and voter bases.\n\nIndependents are at 35% for $15, 31% for $11, and 22% for no change. Even amongst Independents, a solid majority supports raising the federal minimum wage.\n\nSenators Romney and Cotton introduced a bill to increase the federal minimum wage to $10 an hour by 2025, while many Democrats are pushing for $15 per hour. There is room for discussion on this, but attacking Republicans as [racists](https://news.yahoo.com/rep-clyburn-slams-senate-filibuster-142817405.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluZy5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAF7j3skC_5Hr1PqP4ZxcWvYHYuA-M3a5gBC5PfXlHV1kCi5jAuKKV1AyriR4mFcruPFPNqWP7OLdZlO-2CJT_PN_0b8bnx6aZZOw2aUu2Np8Gvuwt5FOwx_ELUDnOns8W2Th0Wq3gAJ9OJ141lKPRETP4OJpdf63O6PXpIdYKgzc) and [misogynists](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kyrsten-sinema-minimum-wage-feminism) at the start of the discussion, or when one side hits a roadblock. With Republicans introducing legislation to increase it, there should be discussion without incendiary attacks from the punditry to inflame the bases. As for me, my older sister is developmentally disabled and works for minimum wage. I would surely like to see it increased, as she has been at the same job for nearly 20 years and is still below $15 per hour. But I dont want to be attacked at the start of it.\n\n**Immigration:** Immigration Healthcare.\n\n[Three-quarters of Americans say undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the U.S. legally | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/17/americans-broadly-support-legal-status-for-immigrants-brought-to-the-u-s-illegally-as-children/ft_2020-06-17_daca_03/)\n\nThe question on this topic is whether undocumented immigrants should have access to healthcare, and its a difficult conversation. Ill put my opinion out there at the start. I was an Infantry Lieutenant in Iraq one night when we were having some downtime from patrols, and we were sitting in our little communal area near our tiny plywood squad bays. I was a bit harder right on the issue, and we were generally saying that illegal immigrants had no right to come to the United States and expect to reap the benefits of our hard work and tax money. One of the guys in the platoon, whom I still love dearly as a brother, said Well, I came here on my Moms back, and my brother was on my Aunts back, and were both serving, so why shouldnt we? Instantly, I changed my stance, and it has been a core memory ever since. Thats anecdotal, yes, but I hold him in higher regards than 99% of the citizenry of this nation.\n\nThis is a very nuanced topic, too. A lot of it revolves around a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, so Ill frame the polls accordingly.\n\n57% of Republicans and 89% of Democrats support allowing undocumented workers to stay in the United States legally, provided certain conditions are met. 42% of Republicans and 10% of Democrats say no, they shouldnt. But both party bases have a majority that support a pathway to citizenship. This would allow these undocumented immigrants to qualify for healthcare when they have achieved citizenship, and qualify for other benefits as well. \n\nAgain, this is very fertile ground for discussions and progress, but the constant fighting between each side is ridiculous. Democratic strongholds establish Sanctuary cities, and Republicans go on the offensive against them. Abolish ICE gets trending on twitter, and Republicans are portrayed as racists. Democrats are attacked as the Party of Open Borders, who would mortgage America towards a potential political base. Its insane that the hyperbole prevents progress.\n\n**Environmental:** Climate Change.\n\n[U.S. Public Views on Climate and Energy | Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2019/11/25/u-s-public-views-on-climate-and-energy/)\n\n90% of Democrats say the government is doing too little to combat Climate Change, while 39% of Republicans say the same. Thats problematic, obviously, because a majority of Republicans dont want significant change. However, 82% of moderate or liberal Republicans say the US should prioritize renewable energy sources, and an increasing amount of Republicans in the 18-39 year old age bracket are agreeing the topic is important, and the government needs to do more. \n\nMy problem, however, comes from my experiences. I worked, for a time, in oil and gas. I support fracking, with significant oversight and regulatory requirements. When done right, its safe for the environment, and reduces emissions significantly. It isnt highly publicized, but fracking for natural gas helped the United States surpass emissions reductions goals set forth in the Kyoto Protocols. The United States actually [*doubled*](https://slate.com/technology/2012/09/thanks-to-fracking-u-s-carbon-emissions-are-at-the-lowest-levels-in-20-years.html) the emissions reductions that the rest of the world was supposed to achieve through the switch from coal to natural gas brought on by fracking.\n\nOutright bans and not allowing discussions to occur limit the effectiveness, and allow problems to persist. I completely agree that the Republican Partys track record has been bad on the topic, but there are gains to be had from working together and actually conversing.\n\nBut these are just 6 topics, and I am sure I left off topics that are the most important ones to some people. But in looking at these, there seems to be more than enough crossover between them, in terms of political support, that things can be achieved without hyperbolic rhetoric between the extreme wings of each party, and network punditry as a whole. \n\nSo my view is that once you get away from that hardcore \\~20% on either side of the spectrum that will never find fault in their party, and you eliminate their voices and attacks from the discussion, that there is room for compromise and progress. It just requires them shutting up, while more moderate voices conduct the discussions.",

Gintoki is sarcastic and funny with many humor coming from him however its doesn't get nearly as repetitive as Edward Elric short jokes. He can both be deep and simple and is just himself, he is not a kid going on a journey. He already went on his journey and has some scars after losing nearly everything, he is now building his life after that. Even though he doesn't change when we see him he does change but in a subtle way in the end with his current life. He doesn't fight to save the world most of the time but to rather help and build connections with people. Gintoki isn't perfect because he suffers from many everyday problems \"wanting his wavy hair straight, eating too much sweets, still reading comics that are not fitting for his age, not wanting to pay went, getting lazy at times, drinking too much alcohol, quite apathetic at times,\" which are problems that at least one of us have experienced \n\nMany Shonen protagonists either being too weak and simple or they make the spotlight too much.

If not wanting to date trans women is transphobic, then lesbians (not wanting to date men) would be menphobic and gays (not wanting to date women) would be womenphobic. It's evident that this is an absurd way to look at sexual preferences.\n\nThe fact that this is even a topic is concerning.

What I mean is the gaseous state of water might not be harmful to them, like the gaseous state of most things are harmful for us. Chorine as a solid isnt poisonous as long as its handled correctly but chorine as a gas kills us really fast. And for some reason, people watching the movie and complain think that the aliens are carbon based life, when there is no evidence of this. Finally we dont actually know what it is in the water that is harmful. The pH? The h2o itself? These are important when considering this. Another thing people cry about are the doors but again why they assume aliens can operate a door is beyond me. For all we know, there doors are automatic, or a difference kind of barrier or portal. If you went to an alien planet where there entrances/exits are portals or something that isnt physically touched, it would take you a hot minute to figure it out. A good example I guess is the entrance to platform nine and three quarters from Harry Potter. When you consider these perspectives, the movie makes a lot of sense. Why they would go to a planet when most of it is poison, I wonder if when humans master space travel if we would pull similar shit, especially if desperate enough. Probably.

        "selftext": "I would absolutely love to be proven wrong here. But let me make my case and explain some background first. A huge thing at the moment in the UK (I don't know if it's made it to world news status) is the recent and tragic death of a girl at the hands of a police officer. It's brought discussions as to how to deal with abusive people to the forefront of everyone's mind. And a very common bit of advice towards men for helping with it is to cut off connections to all abusive men. Now on the surface this makes sense. Don't support abusers. But here's the issue with it: A lot of abusers are the way they are BECAUSE of being ignored all their lives. They are lonely, gain a toxic mindset, and go on to do horrific things. Cutting them out just reinforces the only behaviour they know. Think of how toxic and horrible the incel community is, that's because of the way they are treated.\n\nNow I need to say this to make absolutely sure people don't call me an abuser sympathiser. If you are an abuser in any form, you are scum. Gaining pleasure from making the lives of others worse makes you a parasitic little bitch and I truly hope hell is real, and is your destination past this life. But I don't think that cutting them off will fix anything. What we need to do is find ways to change their mindset and behaviour. Someone who is an abuser won't stop abusing because their friends have stopped hanging out with them, they'll just spend even more of their time abusing. What we need is to get these abusers into therapy. Push them into realising they need help, get them to talk about why they feel this way with a therapist, and maybe fix their broken ass viewpoints.\n\nObviously I'm not saying to be friends with abusive people. But in my opinion, if you have a friend who is showing the telltale signs of being an abuser, don't cut them out and ignore them. Encourage them to get help, push them to change. And if they don't... Idk, beat the shit out of them or something. But the only way we can stop abusers is by making them want to stop. And cutting off any other part of their life won't make them want to stop.\n\nAnyways, as I said at the beginning, I'd love to be proven wrong here. I'd love to be able to just cut off anyone who acts like an abuser without feeling like I'm making the situation worse. So go ahead: CMV",

Their only evidence for this was a Russian evangelical who claimed he was \"sent on a mission by God to destroy America\", who had spoken to 8 American Hispanics, asked them how many of their friends were in detainment camps, and then extrapolated that data over the entire population.\n\nThen, the US publicly offered to let people see their 'concentration camps.' Mexico, Colombia, Panama, Honduras, Costa Rica, and every other Hispanic country accepted that offer, visited the camps, and determined that they were not concentration camps.\n\nChina and Russia refused the offer to see the camps. Then they suddenly start saying they found an anonymous Hispanic person who escaped from the camps, who said that there was organ harvesting, forced sterilisation, and genocide. They officially declare it genocide. Then, they start saying the international community should stop doing business with America. After all, China, Russia, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India all say America is committing genocide. So many countries can't be wrong, can they?\n\nThis is how the 'genocide' in China feels to me right now. Almost all Muslim countries have sent people to inspect these camps, and none of them found evidence of genocide. Many of them even praised China for its effective measures to deradicalise the youth. The only evidence we have for actual genocide is American state-funded media, and a German evangelical who claims he was \"sent by God to destroy China\".\n\nI believe trusting anything American media says about China is like trusting anything Chinese/Russian media says about America. If a North Korean news outlet claimed America was committing genocide without any evidence of it, people would be laughing saying \"haha those North Koreans have so much propaganda how do they believe it?\" yet when American media says the same thing about China it must be true because our government would never lie about a political opponent, they have WMDs and we must go to war with them to stop them.\n\nWhy should we trust what American/Western media says about China more than what Chinese/Russian media says about America?",

        "selftext": "**My argument: Meditation helps a lot of people, but it cannot help anyone unless you broaden the definition to an all-encompassing degree.**\n\nI define meditation as it is popularly conceptualized- meditation is the act of taking time out of ones day to be **fully present** with ones internal and external world. \n\nIve been trying to meditate, and I had a breakthrough today: I *hate* being fully present. Full presence is lonely, uncomfortable, and unsettling. **Because full presence is so uncomfortable, presence for presences sake adds negative value to my life.**\n\nHowever, everything I read says that its normal to feel discomfort, and that the discomfort is worth it. **For the discomfort to be worth it, meditation and presence must have the potential to add positive value to my life.**\n\n**However, I have only achieved the values that pro-meditators argue meditation gives you from *overthinking* life (reflection), not through meditating.** I achieved mindfulness through very, very thought-intensive reflection. Logical reasoning and practice at emotional intelligence have made me aware and comfortable with my emotions. I have also achieved acceptance of the self, perspective, satisfaction, and self-awareness. And while doing this, I usually interact with my outside surroundings (phone games, researching, etc.)\n\nMany people count reflection as meditation, but I personally think thats dishonest and makes meditation into a nothing term. **Reflection and meditation are at two ends of the spectrum.** Reflection implies deep, critical thinking. **Reflection shuns the moment and looks beyond the moment to the bigger picture. Meditation embraces the moment and embraces full presence.** And I dont buy full presence.  \n\nI have been fully present only a few times in my life, and it was 1) when I was on adderall and 2) when Im exhausted. However, Im normally thinking multiple things at once, and rarely am I thinking about the past or future, but the impossible and intangible (chronic daydreamer). **I am *personally* best when I allow reason and possibility to dominate presence instead of allowing presence to exist on its own.**\n\nNow, I can believe that meditation benefits the vast majority of people, like how weed produces calming effects for the vast majority of people. **However, helps a lot of people is different from can help anyone, and I think that we should accept that some people are not cut out for meditating**\n\n**In order to change my view, youd have to convince me of one of these things:**\n1. Presence for presences sake can be valuable to me in its own right\n2. There is something I have not achieved through reflection/overthinking that I can achieve through meditation\n3. Saying that reflection = meditation does not cheapen the meaning of meditation\n4. I am the extreme exception to the rule, and the amount of people who cannot benefit from meditation is so minuscule that the definition of anyone still works functionally",

        "selftext": "Okay, so... lately as these debates surge around mens' places in society as it pertains to policing the actions of other men, I find myself at this point where I fully identify as a left-ish person, feminist, LGBT, progressive etc, but I just don't understand this claim I see a lot of people make (typically women tbh) roughly saying: \"it may only be a small number of men who are bad but 100% of women have been sexually harassed and assaulted. Just look at this case of this guy who killed a girl walking home.\" And I feel like this is kind of specious reasoning, but I'm unsure if I'm just missing some perspective where this makes sense. \n\nThe thing with men saying not all men or some other cringe adage isn't to bolster the fact that it's only a minute group of men as an attempt to minimise doing anything about it, but because we don't really know how to deal with those men either. The men who would follow a woman home and rape her and kill her are not just your every day sexists who think it's cool to manipulate girls into sex or grab their asses or make pervy comments about their bodies. These guys are absolute monsters and we don't have the ability it feels like we're expected to have to somehow like socialise these men out of their sociopathy before the fact. It sort of feels like seriously heinous crimes like raping and murdering of women is treated as just the logical progression of ignorant misogyny in culture and that all women who are raped and murdered are having this done to them by your everyday guy who just, through culture and patriarchy, doesn't see the inherent problem with acting like this. \n\nI don't really know how my or my friends' views on women and changes in behaviour are supposed to bulwark sadistic psychopaths against slaughtering people walking home. It just seems like such a valid frustration on behalf of women but such a misguided campaign to address what (to me) is really a super rare freak occurrence. The analogy I guess i would draw is like say you hear of an old friend you know and he's on the news one day because he's snuck into a farm and tortured and killed a bunch of pigs, mutilated and desecrated their bodies and then carved into their bodies all sorts of sick imagery, it wouldn't make sense to me to turn around and hold men accountable for how they view animals and say that if we all had held animals in higher regard this never would have happened, when 99.99% of us physically couldn't bring ourselves to ever do this to an animal. I don't know if I make any sense or not, but I really want to get it as I feel like most times I've disagreed with the typically progressive view, it has turned out to be through not understanding concepts enough personally, so please, point out any gaps in my perception or whatever.

Drugs arent the problem and criminalizing them will not create the change that lawmakers hope it will.\nI am not a drug user. The only substances I take of that nature are alcohol and caffeine, if you would consider that to be one. I have no intention of ever taking drugs because I know Im at risk of addiction due to my mental health history, and that is also the reason I empathise with drug users.\n\nWe tend to forget that addiction is an illness just like anything else, and in doing so we are able to distance a (repeated) action from ourselves and dehumanize the addict in order to convince ourselves that there is no chance we could end up like that. We see this pattern in our view of drugs and the moral weight assigned to them. We see drugs as the evil and the people as the accomplices and it ends there.\n\nBut we dont see the reason why. 40% of drug addicts suffer from a comorbid mental illness and 20% of those with mental illness suffer from an addiction. Its not because addicts are bad people. Its because they need help and treatment and compassion.\n\nThere is a drug crisis, but waging a war on drugs and throwing everyone who ever passed a blunt in jail for 20 years isnt going to solve anything. We need awareness and treatment. We need affordable and equitable opportunities for those who are suffering to get help. We need to understand that people suffering from addiction are human beings who are suffering.\n\nDrugs arent the problem.

        "selftext": "As someone who is in most ways pretty far left on the political spectrum I've been excited to see people start to understand and pay attention to the ways in which the world is structurally unfair to certain groups and to see a sort of power shift toward overall less powerful groups (in particular African Americans). But I believe it is turning into a competition to find new ways to view every interaction and every facet of life as a type of victimization and to reductively label people as villains or agents of white supremacy. For example, around this time last year white people were being told that being silent on the issue of BLM was equivalent to supporting white supremacy. Then they were told that talking about it so much was centering themselves in the conversation. Now they're being told that just having BLM in their twitter handles is woke virtue signaling for the benefit of other white people and propping up white supremacy by letting people feel like they're doing something but not actually doing something. Another example could be how white people were encouraged to embrace diversity and amplify black voices, but then were accused of \"digital blackface\" for using reaction gifs of black people or sounding too black in the type of language they use online.\n\nEven though there is a kernel of truth to most of these arguments, I think the costs of these constant attacks are a) people disengaging from politics and speaking up less because of the high risk of eventually being accused of being a bad person, b) racialized/marginalized people's mental health deteriorating as a result of constant focus on victimhood and unfairness, c) decreased unity as a result of constant emphasis on differences and white people as a separate group, d) empowering right-wingers who are using the more extreme examples of wokeness to discredit the left, e) canceling people with large platforms who maybe got some things wrong but other things right and on balance may have been doing more good than bad, and f) making things worse by focusing on incomplete narratives. An example of f) would be maybe convincing Black Americans that any interaction with police is likely to end up with them being shot, even though statistically it is a very, very tiny percentage of interactions between unarmed Black people and police that end up with someone being shot (less than 0.025 percent according to the best available data), which can lead to Black communities disengaging with police which can in turn lead to Black communities being underprotected and increasingly victimized by crime.\n\nThis isn't just the same old \"there's going to a backlash\" warning that accompanies any progress. What I'm worried about is that we are settling into a type of identity politics that itself eventually takes us backward rather than forward or at a minimum stops forward progress.",

        "title": "CMV: A single flat tax on revenue would create more social good than the current US tax code",
        "selftext": "The title, but here are my reasons:\n\n1. Simpler - Taxing revenue is easy for anyone to understand and calculate. When you collect the revenue, you charge your client/customer the tax (or pay it yourself -- it's up to you). You could even remit the taxes to the government near instantly if you wanted to because there are no additional calculations to be made. The money you earn Dec. 31st is exactly the same as the money you earn on Jan. 1.\n2. Fairer - By eliminating tax breaks, business expenses, etc. you eliminate the financial accounting  adjustments that are easily available to the rich and rarely utilized or applicable to the poor. No more billion dollar individuals or corporations paying less taxes than a cab driver. Everyone pays the same flat tax.\n3. Less expensive - No CPAs or TurboTax needed. Type in your revenue for the year and you're done. Or, banks could even automatically remit taxes for you as you deposit money. For the government, audits would also be faster and less expensive.\n4. More precise - No more need for fuzzy estimates about how much an estate is worth and no concern about intent or wether an expense was business or personal.\n5. Lower admin costs - There would be fewer and faster IRS audits because the calculations are so simple. There would be no more intent about what is/isn't a home business or is/isn't a reasonable business expense. If you want to spend money on your business, go for it, it just won't have any impact on the taxes you owe.\n6. Clearer - A tax code so simple, every citizen can understand it. Simplicity and transparency creates trust.\n\nObjections:\n\n1. A flat tax would increase income inequality - Possibly. But hopefully eliminating tax breaks and business expenses that disproportionately help the rich would offset that. Or, you could increase social programs / benefits to the poor.\n2. Prices for products and services will increase to cover the cost of the tax - Yes, that's true, but they already do that. I think the market would adjust.\n3. Our economy would suffer because there would be less of an incentive to make tax-deductible purchases - True, but it doesn't make sense to me to allow a carpenter to deduct the cost of a hammer but not a home owner. It shouldn't matter what someone's intent is. I'd also argue that there are other ways to artificially encourage spending like stimulus checks.\n4. Some tax credits help lower income groups - You could replace those tax credits with programs similar to the COVID stimulus checks where the process is transparent for the citizen and provided when needed, not just once a year at tax time. Also, a tax credit doesn't help you much if you have little to no income. A check in the mail helps everyone.\n5. What about tax credits for disadvantaged groups - In my opinion we should be trying to address social inequality in our culture and the courts rather than the tax code. If an individual or group has a discrimination claim, that should be handled through a civil lawsuit.\n6. It would be harder to provide help based on means tests - True, but the government should already know your name, your age, your address, how much revenue you've made and how many kids you have. Those metrics should be enough to create social programs that are at least as reasonably effective as the tax credits we have now. Once you get beyond those metrics, I'd argue you're creating more complexity for not much additional benefit.\n7. Charities will suffer - Charitable donations should be out of generosity, not out of the reciprocity. I grant this could be a potential negative, but outweighed by the potential positives.\n8. If people pay their taxes instantly, they will lose the opportunity cost of keeping their money for up to a year before paying taxes - OK, but then the government could lower taxes because now it's getting the opportunity of receiving the money up to a year earlier.\n9. What will the rate be - I'm not sure, but I'm more focused on the concept of taxing revenue only vs. current US tax code. If you need a ballpark, let's say it'll be somewhere in the range of 5-15%  for the sake of argument.",

        "selftext": "This is largely based on observation.\n\nOver the past few years I've regularly seen situations pop up where certain phrases or ideas cause people to automatically assume to know what the person stating it is thinking. And the assumption is nearly always one of bad faith. \n\nMost recently, for instance, responding to the question \" Do you think that black lives matter?\" with \"I think that all lives matter.\" would make you a racist by default. \n\nAnother example is the whole #notallmen debacle, where it was decided that using that hashtag or even stating that not all men rape or abuse women means you're intending to silence women's issues. \n\nThere's more examples I can think of, but the general idea should be clear with these two very prominent and well known examples. \n\nTo be clear, this CMV is not about discussing either of these issues.\n\nWhat it is about is the seemingly acceptable nature of assuming the intent behind those statements.\n\nClearly, at least to me, these phrases can ALSO be taken at face value to mean what they literally state.

But assuming the phrase is by default a sign of bad intentions is nothing more than pretending to know what the other person is thinking or what their intentions are.

        "selftext": "To keep this as short as possible, I will jump right into my argument.\n\nI believe movies and shows normalize violence against men. Male characters are killed much, much more numerously and brutally than female characters, snd this goes for main and side characters as well as nameless extras.\n\nWomen are rarely ever torn apart limb from limb in movies. Women are rarely ever hacked apart in movies. Women are rarely ever eaten by monsters in movies. Women rarely have their heads crushed by a character's bare hands (and so on and so forth). Not that it never happens, but I can think of multiple examples of the above scenarios happening to male characters and rarely any for female characters. Also when it does happen, it is almost always off-screen where for mrn everything happens in plain sight. In other words, I believe on-screen violence against men is seen as much more acceptable than on-screen violence against women. And even when somen die in far more sanitary ways than men, their deaths are treated as far worse than that of men.\n\nIf this was the case only with henchmen and soldiers which makes sense to be mostly male, it would have been at least understandable, but it does not stop there. Most civilians that die in chaos scenes are male.\n\nEven in settings where equality should be present like in the Walking Dead (both genders are shown as equally capable), this pattern still remains. One of the main characters literally says something along the lines of \"I dont like killing women, but men I can waste all night long\". This character dispatches many men in extremely brutal ways, but no women whatsoever. In other words, even when equality is achieved, it isn't exactly ewuality if you know what I mean.\n\nWith all of the modern equality outcry, shouldn't this outdated mentality be changed?\n\nOnce again, I believe there are outlier examples but they are only few and far between. Modern movies do not follow this pattern as egregiously as before, but it still remains. After doing some research on this, I havr found [this](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;client=ms-android-samsung-rev2&amp;source=android-browser&amp;q=tvtropes+men+are+the+expendbale+gender), and it does not seem like I am the only one to notice this.

        "title": "CMV: Wages must increase, but minimum wages do more harm than good.",
        "selftext": "You might be reading this title and thinking that I'm about to explain my position using conservative tropes about who does or doesn't deserve certain wages. I am not. Purchasing power, including in the form of wages, must increase in totality, across the board for nearly every job in America. It must increase even more for the lowest earning jobs in the nation. \n\nFederally mandated minimum wages are the most inefficient, and unsustainable way to raise wages. Relying on them requires the assumption that there are no other valid solutions. Pushing for minimum wages and ignoring the other solutions creates a cumbersome solution that is at the complete control of whichever way the federal government swings in an election year. Reliance on the federal government to set wages is the reason why we are in such a bad position now, when they can't get it done as needed. It is a temporary fix that slows or stops the momentum of real solutions, and can be skirted or reversed by Republicans down the line. Lastly it only lifts up the very bottom, which compresses wages at the low end and puts more people into the same marginally low income level (sub teachers making as much as someone at mcdonalds), instead of lifts them all up (teachers should be making relatively more, just like the mcdonalds workers).\n\nFederally mandated minimum wages also reward the largest companies, and hurt the smallest ones. During covid we saw the largest transfer of capital into large corporations ever. It was also during a time we saw the most small businesses closing. Large corporations support the minimum wage because they are already paying it. They have the margins and capital to do so. The truth is many mom and pop shops cannot afford a $15 minimum wage, but have family or small town employees that understand and are ok with this. They know that the cost of living in NYC is not the same as rural Iowa. Mandating that they all must follow the same laws, even in rough time, is unfair. Paying employees too little is unfair as well, but again, there is a better way to handle this. \n\nHow then, do we solve the problem? Three ways:\n\n1. A robust social benefit system. Alleviate major life expenses that offset earnings, such as medical coverage, cost of basic higher education, and for low earners, some housing, food, and transportation costs. Without doing this, the new wage mandate will simply transfer new income to these costs, raising costs and inflation for all. Although wages should be market driven, these things should not be market driven as they are necessary for basic living. No person should have to wonder if they might die, or can't get to work. \n2. A robust labor union / trade organization system. Majority enrollment in small to medium sized unions who represent workers and employers and use current systems of government to hash out fair earnings on their behalf. Representation for the market, rather than just the government. These unions are responsible for your minimum wage, instead of the government. Someone who represents your specific industry and interests, who is focused on real productivity and earnings, sets your fair wage, and revisits this topic constantly to keep up with changing costs and markets.\n3. (Most importantly) grassroots movement. The current wave of apathy / entitlement will prevent this. The government is not here to save you. We must band together to fight for these things, inspire friends and neighbors to feel they can get more, rather than deserve more. It is squarely on our shoulders and the time for new unions is here. \n\nLet's look at some non US examples of nations with high median and high minimum income levels: \n\n* Denmark\n* Austria\n* Norway\n* Iceland\n* Finland\n* Sweden\n\nNone of these countries have a minimum wage.  In fact the most recently famous example, Denmark, was audaciously used as an example [by Bernie Sanders &amp; AOC](https://www.newsweek.com/aoc-calls-minimum-wage-debate-embarrassing-1573373) to argue for a minimum wage here, yet is currently [in the middle of fighting the EU,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-28/denmark-prepares-to-fight-eu-s-proposal-for-minimum-wage) over their attempts to force a minimum wage upon them. It begs the question of how we could possibly continue to use these nations as examples, when they themselves are fighting the very thing we are trying to use them as examples for. It's hard to wrap your brain around. \n\nThese nations all have [higher economic freedom indexes](https://www.heritage.org/index/ranking) than the US. \n\nUp until the terribly done tax cuts of 2017, they all also had [lower corporate tax rates than the US.](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/corporate-tax-rate) \n\nBut they also have less tax loopholes and a simplified system which means companies pay a higher effective rate. They have higher rates of personal income tax, even at the low income level. And they also use those taxes efficiently for public programs. They push everyone into unions to bargain for wages, and they use tax dollars to alleviate enormous barriers to success. That means the wages you actually do take home, are used for savings, family, and leisure, instead of just trying to survive. \n\nBy not having minimum wages and using these methods, the nations avoid the argument that small family businesses will fail. They do not reward corporations that can afford the mandate and lobby for or against another in the future. And they create a fair and adaptive system for ongoing wage growth that matches inflation or deflation. \n\nThis is by far the most equal, effective method of wage growth. American progressives are shooting for the simplest and most archaic method, while much of the world has figured out the solution long ago. \n\nWhen Democrats control the government, they attempt to use the arms of government to make small gains, consolidating that power and control, and creating dependence upon them to get any more. When Republicans gain control, they misuse the ideas of freedom to earn, as a way to roll back those efforts. Neither has our back, and it is important we can outsmart and outplay those in power by demanding the programs that really work for us.",

I follow a lot of pages centered around the black community, and I notice that we celebrate the most minuscule of stuff as if it helps or progresses us as a community. I feel that we as a community priority and glorify the wrong things way too often. I look to a lot of other communities such as the Asian community, where they prioritize education and work ethic. So Im not surprised when I see Asians doing well, Im not surprised when Asians get into prestigious colleges. But then when I look at the black community, I see nothing progressive that we prioritize. All I see is continuous infighting, and 9/10 is all over frivolous bullshit that nobody has control over anymore. So many of us are so focused on the wrong thing, and whenever one of use does something that is pretty normal in comparison to other cultures/communities, we label it black excellence, when in reality that should be the standard. We claim we hate the stereotypes about us, then go carry out said stereotypes. A large portion of us have this victim mentality, as if we cant decide our own fate, as if there is someone preventing us from living our lives, granted, we go through struggles such as police brutality, but that doesnt stop you from living your life, and if it is, thats your own damn fault. We are always the first to jump on and critique someone for the same shit we do. And when a white person says all of this, he gets labeled racist and gets his ass beat(yes Iv seen that happen on numerous occasions) all for pointing out what we as a community continue to ignore. And when a black person says all of this, its honestly worse, because then you get ostracized and told your not black or you hate your own people when In Reality the black people who speak up are the ones who care the most. We as a community havent progressed not one bit in the last 20 years. And unless we as a people start moving forward and stop living in the past as if it is effect YOU PERSONALLY, then we will still be in the same sport for 20 more years. It aint about what happened in the past, nor am I criticizing the black community for the past, Im criticizing us for our reluctancy to more forward into the future.

        "selftext": "**Economics is too complex to deal with using current tools.**\n\nSo, my basic view: Hundreds of years ago we had alchemists and \"doctors\" talking about the four elements, the four humors, whatever. These were not stupid people, they were just wannabe scientists existing in an era where the tools to properly approach their domain did not exist. Mathematicians of the day produced many valuable results that hold up into the modern era, because mathematics is a domain that can (usually) be approached without advanced tools. Physics and chemistry, however, required sophisticated tools for precise, measurable experiments and observations, which they just didn't have. Try to be a chemist or physicist in a society that doesn't have glass or clocks.\n\nEconomics (and social sciences in general, though I'm focused on economics) are today what those \"pseudo-scientists\" were then. Math is simpler and easier easier than chemistry and physics; chemistry and physics are simpler and easier than biology and medicine; biology and medicine are simpler and easier than psychology; psychology is simpler and easier than sociology and economics. \n\nHere's what I posit: Economics is simply beyond us right now. Maybe some future society will have the tools to do it right. Maybe they'll even build off of existing work. Right now, we're ancient Greeks speculating on the composition of matter - not a worthless pursuit, but not one that can make useful predictions.\n\n**We can't do real experiments.**\n\nIn hard sciences, the experimental process is rigid and sacrosanct. Everything must be controlled for, and many, repeated and independent trials are necessary to confirm a result. The less controlled the experiment, the more tests are necessary. In biology and medicine, animal testing calls for subjects with known genetic history and environmental factors.\n\nWe can't have those in \"sciences\" dealing with large human populations. A \"trial\" isn't a person, it's an entire market. You could be nice and say that a city over a year is a trial, but that's far from independent as it relies of impacts from other years and other cities. Imagine someone conducting a drug trial as messy and ill-controlled as the data economists use.\n\n I see arguments pointing to past eras as evidence for or against assorted policies, and it just seems like laughably weak evidence. Wouldn't you expect a socialist nation taking marching orders from Moscow to maybe be different from one that existed independent of the USSR? Won't immigration policy implemented during the Holocaust have different impacts? \n\nThose are obvious examples, but a cascade of other factors could also render any \"experiment\" meaningless. This leads me to a difficult conclusion for anyone hoping to approach decision-making from a rigorous or data-driven position: Nothing has ever been done before. In systems this complex, there are too many changing, interlocking factors to ever see the same situation twice.\n\n*The theory of Microeconomics fails to meet its assumptions*\n\nI should cop to something up front here - I am basing this on having taken a single undergraduate microeconomics course, so I am absolutely \"That guy\". With that said:\n\nMicroeconomics starts with a set of assumptions that allow it to mathematically model the behavior of a market, then proves that if a further set of conditions are met, free markets will be ideal (\"Pareto Optimal\"). The problem is that neither set of assumptions is *ever* met. I can't remember all of the assumptions, but they include:\n\n* Perfectly-informed and rational participants acting in self interest\n* Functionally unlimited number of buyers and sellers who do not collude\n* No entry or exit costs from the market\n* Identical, interchangeable products\n* No externalities\n\nNot *one* of those assumptions is ever met by any real-world market. The math is perfectly good, and economists seem happy to run with it, but the map does not match the terrain. They acknowledge this, but seem to claim that it is \"Close enough\" to use as a predictive model.\n\nI don't think it is. Just look at the very first assumption - if that were true, if people were rational and well-informed in their purchasing, advertising would not exist. Google, one of the most successful companies on earth, would not exist. It's clear that reality diverges from what their model predicts.\n\n**tl;dr:** We have people attempting a discipline orders of magnitude more complex than the hard sciences, without the ability to conduct experiments or independent/isolated cases to learn from, and whose theory fails to align with reality at the ground floor. Why should I or anyone listen to them?",

Its makes sense in the US. Police budgets are ridiculously bloated in many states, they have all kinds of military grade stuff which just isnt needed.

        "selftext": "Even for full Asians who grow up in the West, a lot of them are considered whitewashed and know little about their mother language or what their parents country are really like. If even full Asians are often too Westernized and not knowledgeable to speak about what their parents country and culture is really like, Half Asians are even less knowledgeable since only one parent is giving them Asian influence. If they dont like it, they can retreat to their other parent. I think its not good for half Asians to try to comment on Asian topics and issues since they dont fully understand Asian values, history, and perspectives. I would argue that even whitewashed Asians should refrain on speaking on these issues in front of non-Asians as they will only provide a misinformed opinion to others that will be a poor reflection on Asians.\n\nHowever, I believe that if a half Asian grows up in an Asian country, they are essentially more Asian than a full Asian growing up in the West. Even if a Westernized Asian reads a lot about their parents country, it will be acquiring knowledge, but it cannot provide a full view of what perspectives are held by people actually living in Asian countries.\n\nTLDR: Ones genetic background should not give them a free pass to speak about Asian culture and the Asian experience, those who are immersed in the culture are the ones who have meaningful input. Therefore, a half Asian who grew up in the US probably shouldnt be telling people what China is like when theyve only visited once.

What I mean is that taxing the rich wont make them less greedy, in fact if they lose income they will only lower wages to their employees. They are used to their current income and a hit in that will lead them to finding a resolution. This will be in forms such as laying off employees, or finding cheaper alternatives for their businesses. I understand not every rich person got rich by owning a business, but definitely a large majority has. I fail to see how taxing the rich would better the economy or better wages/work quality.\n\nLastly, criticizing rich people for making exotic purchases is just wrong. Imagine working hard and becoming successful financially only for people to criticize you for spending your hard earned money. They have no obligation to donate their money, and rightfully can use it to enjoy their life however they please. The criticism Jeff Bezos is facing for buying a new mansion to me is insane. He worked hard to get where he is building Amazon from the ground up. I know a lot of rich people didnt work for their money, but someone before them did. I fail to see why people see rich people making expensive places as bad.\n\nSomeone change my view, or help me see the other side of the argument.\n\nTLDR: Taxing rich would lead them to make cuts in their businesses to make more money.

What I feel is really going on is emotional investment in an issue is being prioritized over competent reasoning. And I believe this is very harmful for human discourse. In fact, a lot of the time I believe proximity to an issue makes your opinion less reliable because you have such a stake in the outcome. There's a reason innocence, guilt and sentencing are decided by people who are acting impartially in a court setting.

        "selftext": "Change my view, \n\nI believe that if we opened the US-Mexican border for work, education, and family immigration, the USA would see a lot of prosperity and the negative effects would be moderate compared to the benefits it would provide.\n\nWhy I believe this ideas include the following:\n\n1. Having migrants who work jobs that have labor shortages that are essential to the US economy is vital to help run the economy. At a sub 2.1 US birthrate, we can't replace enough workers to work agricultural, transportation, construction, civil, the trades, factory, medical, hospitality, and other crucial jobs in the US economy. Having migrants specifically from Mexico/Central America where their birthrates often exceed 2.1+/family would be a way to make sure the backbone jobs of America are filled and keep America running smoothly. \n\n2. Even if immigrants send billions of dollars in remittances (for example: wiring money), that money doesn't disappear, that money will go towards funding the Mexican/central american economies raising the standards of living similar to what happened in China/Japan. Since we live in a global economy, some of that money should circulate back to the USA through trade. \n\n3. By offering an honest way to immigrate to the USA, we would demolish the human trafficking business overnight since migrants would no longer resort to smugglers to get around the $1000s of dollars in processing for even the most basic visas. It would reduce the border crisis if people could just get a work permit to work in the USA temporarily. \n\n4. The saturation of the labor market could be solved by a priority hiring system where US citizens are considered first priority to getting hired. In addition, the US government should ensure migrants are paid fair wages for their work just like US natives. Making union protections apart of the labor market along with higher minimum wages with free education/vocations. \n\n5. When migrants are paid money, it's not a one way street, that money gets spent back into the local economy, legal migrants would pay taxes like the rest of us, and migrants could start businesses employing Americans just like American businesses. Having a lot of migrants in the USA wouldn't mean lower wages, considering migrants can also start businesses in the USA.\n\n6. Looking at US visa processing times, even for someone who's a citizen married to a foreigner has a 12 month back log to legally enter the country. The USA needs to streamline immigration to allow for a more progressive, and reasonable immigration system that prevents people resorting to illegal immigration.\n\n7. Numerous studies have shown that migrants commit less crimes per capita than US citizens, the idea of immigrants being criminals doesn't line up with the statistics.\n\n8. When people are against immigration and \"open borders\", I feel that they think the US border is an open door that anyone can walk through. Few people realize all US visas (other than visa waiver visas exclusive to rich countries) make it nearly impossible for a lot of migrants to even visit let alone work in the country. The US border is a very strong border to get into. I don't feel that the US has an open border, but rather a very restrictive border.\n\nPlease explain to me things that may help change my view, I am willing to listen to you all.",

        "selftext": "To start with some context: In New Zealand last year, the establishment of safe zones was made impossible outside of abortion clinics due to a change in abortion legislation. Now, a new bill has passed its first reading, 100 votes to 15. It will make it illegal to \"intimidate, obstruct, or more generally protest\" in the safe areas of no more than 150 metres in radius.\n\nPerhaps 150 metres is a little wide, but even if the radius was smaller, I support in general the establishment of these safe zones, even though they can be seen as restricting peoples rights to protest.\n\nThere is one hypothetical scenario that *no one* who is against these safe zones, because they say they put limits on protesting, has answered me about:\n\n&gt;In a hypothetical situation, let's imagine paedophile sympathisers are gathering outside schools protesting being able to legally diddle kids. Would you support or oppose any restrictions aside from disallowing protestors barring entry?\n\nIf your argument is I disagree with safe zones because infringements on the right to protest just because it makes people uncomfortable and/or provides trauma is unacceptable, I would like to hear your answer to the hypothetical.\n\nNow, Im not trying to go too far the other way. I am not saying that discomfort is *always* an acceptable reason to restrict protest. But I think it *can* be, and it should be up to the community to decide where these limits lie by contacting their representatives regarding the issues and voting for politicians with their preferred policies.\n\nI would really be interested in having my view changed on this, because I am generally very much in favour of freedom to protest, and inflicting discomfort is a good way to change things.

        "selftext": "#TL:DR\n\nLGBTs need to accept that there is no way that they can change the Catholic Church's stance. The Catholic Church has a myriad of theological justifications as to why they will never accept gay sex and gay marriage. As much as I hate to say it, LGBTs must either accept that the Catholic Church is not for them, or abstain from gay sex and gay marriage if they want to stay in the church. As a strong proponent for LGBT rights, I believe in focusing our efforts elsewhere, because it is impossible to change the Catholic Church's stance.\n\n# Inspiration\n\nThis CMV post is inspired by the news article [Vatican says Catholic Church will not bless same-sex unions as God 'cannot bless sin'](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/vatican-says-catholic-church-will-not-bless-same-sex-unions-as-god-cannot-bless-sin). This announcement is deepening the culture war and is causing flame wars on social media.\n\n#Disclaimer\n\nBefore you call me a bigot or a Catholic fundamentalist, I myself am not religious, which is a point of contention within my family. I am not LGBT, but I am a staunch supporter of LGBT rights. \n\n#Actual CMV content\n\nBefore my 24th birthday last year, I requested that I no longer be forced to go to church. My brother, who is a seminarian, challenged me to a debate, because he demands I defend my stances. I lost the debate, and I go into more details about it [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ly6z31/cmv_it_is_impossible_for_australias_major_parties/gpxikeg?context=100) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/k2q042/anti_catholicism/gdzmy0l?context=100).\n\nOne of the arguments I used in a separate debate with my brother (not shown on the above 2 links) is the following:\n\n&gt;**Me**: Perhaps I wouldn't sympathise so strongly with homosexuals if I wasn't forced me to suppress my personality just like they are.\n&gt;\n&gt;**My brother**: Once again, you demonstrate your poor understanding of the faith. The Catholic Church accepts homosexuals and accepts that they can't be changed. But homosexuals have to understand that we can't accept same-sex marriage and sexual activities because it's not our decision to make - God simply does not accept that.\n\nMy brother is right, [the Catholic Church does accept homosexuals](https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2020/09/17/pope-francis-parents-lgbt-children-god-loves-your-children-they-are) and [condemns gay conversion therapy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-lgbt-therapy-idUSKBN1XO22U). He is also right that the Catholic Church cannot accept same-sex marriage (as per Mark 10:6-8) or sexual relations (as per 1 Timothy 1:8-11). I am not saying that the Bible is correct here because I cannot prove or disprove that it is. However, the reason I brought up those Bible passages is because the Catholic Church uses them to explain why they can never accept same-sex marriage or sexual relations. \n\nIn another debate I've had with my brother, he told me that I need Catholicism to teach me objective morality ([see here](http://imgur.com/a/jVrxqdd), I'm in purple text boxes, he's in grey text boxes). Catholicism will never bless same-sex unions because it sees itself as the source of objective morality, set in stone by God, which mere mortals can never change. Because of this, LGBTs need to accept that there is no way that they can change the Catholic Church's stance. As much as I hate to say it, LGBTs must either accept that the Catholic Church is not for them, or abstain from gay sex and gay marriage if they want to stay in the church.\n\nI am not trying to simp for the Catholic Church in all of this. If anything, this has done nothing to change my lack of religious faith. However, as a staunch supporter of LGBT rights, I believe that anyone who supports LGBT rights must realise that it will be impossible to change the Catholic Church's stance, so we need to find other ways of advancing LGBT rights instead of complaining about the Catholic Church.\n\nFinally, please no \"*whatabout the paedophile priests*\". If we start using dirty tricks like guilt by association and whataboutism against Catholics like that, then it gives Catholics the right to retaliate, and they can give atheists guilt by association for the atrocities of Mao and Stalin, or give Muslims guilt by association for Islamic terrorist attacks, and so on.",

Are you seriously changing your viewpoint for not having children at the age where you could've been a grandmother?\n\nThe opinion of 'my body my choice' does;t make sense either.

Furthermore, I want to understand why its a good branding/marketing technique for everyday conversation, so I can help to educate people because I do believe that the core ideology (policing needs to change) is true. \n\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that policing in the US needs a reform. I grew up in predominantly black communities, had many black friends, we did all the same stupid shit together, yet they got in significantly more trouble than I did. I honestly can see no reason for this other than racial discrimination. This lead to many of them essentially choosing a life of crime over growing up and out of the cycle, and thus its perpetuated. \n\n\nWhat I dont agree with, is defunding police. I just cant see how defunding police will improve policing in the US. Crime is still a thing, regardless of how much money police departments receive. I believe that what policing needs is a reform, possibly some kind of centralized hiring process, a centralized conduct supervisory division, a clear if/than with conduct that includes not being afraid to fire and prosecute officers for misconduct and breaking laws, and a centralized supervisory division for allocation of policing funds. This could be one single centralized system. But all of this would cost money, and defunding police would not achieve this. Defunding them would be like defunding underperforming schools, which is already done, as has clearly undesirable consequences.\n\n\nIf defunding police has a different meaning than what it sounds like on the surface, its marketed or branded poorly, and thats a problem. Marketing and branding is **huge** and contributes enormously to the success of, well, pretty much everything. To say that this one thing is down to the individual to research and discover how its branded name differs from its actual meaning is irrational. \n\n\nCMV.",

We are living amidst a pandemic. The four arrests made by police were important to disperse the crowd. They were not assaulting people, they were arresting them, and protecting lives. They did not use excessive force, and followed standard procedure.\n\nThe judge ruling was completely correct to disallow the vigil. So many funerals have been cancelled due to CoVid, why is she more important than all of these other people, and why is she more important than the lives of our brave NHS workers?\n\nAdditionally, Cressida Dick should not resign. I believe she handled the situation well. She knew there would be backlash. She jeopardised her career and public image to save lives. She is a hero.\n\nOne last thing, slightly unrelated, but I hate how the situation is sometimes represented as a problem with men that men need to fix.\n\nMen get assaulted too. Women assault people too. Sure, its mostly men assaulting women, but everyone can be a victim. it shouldn't be \"men vs women\" it should be \"victims vs attackers\" Its a problem for all of us, and so we should tackle it together, not separated by sex.",

That being said, I'm not arguing for the Devil here, as I actually believe -- as improbable as it may be -- that it's scientifically possible, and financially feasible for someone to be microchipped against their will. Do I believe that's what's happening? No.\n\nMy thinking:\n\n1. Microchips don't require batteries.  \nRFID\n2. There is no distance limit on RF technology.  \nThe packaging only has a distance limit to help you make the purchase. Hackers use RFID skimmers all the time. SDR can be used to mirror monitors wirelessly.\n3. If there is a distance limit  \nHow much stuff do you touch in a day?\n4. Companies have financial incentive to track you.  \nGoogle, Android, Facebook, Apple etc are all dying. You can look it up. Their usage numbers are plummeting.

        "selftext": "I am generally against race based affirmative action, but I am willing to make a compromise with its proponents, so I am suggesting that we limit its beneficiaries to American descendants of slavery (ADOS) and Native Americans.\n\n - Limiting affirmative action to ADOS and Natives can serve as a tangible act of reparations, unlike the current system which affects all groups. Its beneficiaries might be recent African immigrants whose ancestors may have sold the ancestors of ADOS into slavery, upper class Latinx people whose ancestors may have directly participated in the genocide of the indigenous peoples, and so on. By limiting the scope of this, we can knock down multiple birds with one stone by helping people who actually need help and carrying out restorative justice.\n\n - What many people overlook in the debates about affirmative action is that the college applications process is a very individualistic one. There is no \"we\" in \"college admissions\", only \"i\". Even people who are fully supportive of racial equality measures will not be happy if they had to give up their own spots. Likewise, a member of an underrepresented group would likely not be happy if they had to give up their seat for whatever reason, even if they were giving it up to another member of the same minority group. By reducing the number of beneficiaries, we can also reduce the degree to which someone might become disadvantaged just for their race.\n\n - This will help prevent the \"Dolezal problem\" of people falsely claiming to be underrepresented minorities for affirmative action benefits. Native American nations already require tribal ID to identify as such, and such IDs are sometimes requested as proof when one identifies as Native American on college applications. Establishing such a system for ADOS, in which they would have to prove that they were descended from freed slaves, could help limit the benefits of affirmative actions to those who deserve it.",

BUT you also know that there is no system used to determine which employees work remotely or work in-person, so you could probably receive the treatment without mentioning that you work remotely at all.\n\n My gut reaction is that this trying to get the treatment as a remote worker in an otherwise-eligible industry isn't ethical - it feels like cheating. Hypothetically, receiving this treatment might 'remove' the availability of it for someone who is legitimately in a high-risk group (i.e. a high school teacher doing in-person classes). CMV?",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am not trying to instill hate or troll people. I really want some answers on that, since I've been involved in quite a few discussions lately. And I got a really hard time wrapping my head around the whole controversy.  I consider myself absolutely NOT transphobic, because I support their rights to live life how they want to. But I also support everyone else's right to make their own decisions and chose partners based on any preference they have without being shamed for it.\n\nI've seen a lot of controversy about this topic on multiple social media platforms. And it always ends up with men who say that they wouldn't date a trans person if they knew about it, because it is their preference. And LGBTQ+ folks that say, a trans person has no obligation to disclose their transition at any point if they don't want to and men wouldn't be able to tell someone transitioned successfully anyway. Anyone who disagrees with LGBTQ+ folks gets instantly slammed as \"transphobic\". Even if they just state, that they prefer non-trans people of the opposite sex as their partner but are pro-trans choice otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got a huge issue with people not disclosing that they transitioned. I got a lot of LGBTQ+ friends and I fully support their rights to date and do whatever they want. At the same time, I wouldn't want to date someone who transitioned, as it is not my preference. This also includes, if I couldn't tell at the beginning, that they used to have a different sex before.\n\n1) For me it doesn't matter if someone transitioned and no longer has male genitalia. Because during the operation, their genitals gets basically turned inside out to create a vagina (yes, I've seen detailed surgery videos). I am not attracted to that in any way.\n\n2) Even if they get an uterus transplant and are able to have children, I wouldn't want to have kids with them. When I fall in love with someone and we decide to start a family, I want to have children WITH THEM. Not with the uterus / egg donor. My trans partner would simply be a surrogate mom to someone else's child. What if I normally wouldn't ever date the donor, because it is absolutely not my type but suddenly I mix my DNA with them? Nah ... not for me.\n\n3) I generally dislike plastic surgery in any partner (no matter if cis, trans or whatever). Fake boobs? Nope, please move along. Fixed nose and lip filler? Nope, I'd rather keep looking for the right one. Why is it transphobic to not want to date someone that underwent major surgery to change their appearance (and body parts), when it also applies to cis women and is a basic preference of mine ?\n\n4) By not disclosing that you are trans, you are robbing the other person of a choice to say no. You put your own personal gain in front of someone else's, risking to upset or psychologically harm them in the process if they find out. It is common courtesy to inform the other involved party, so that they can make an informed decision. Just because you transitioned and think this is right, doesn't mean everyone shares your worldview. You cannot expect tolerance for your own choices. The right thing to do is to be open about it and find someone who loves you for who you truly are, not for who you appear to be. \n\n5) Lets say I am very tolerant and respect the trans communities wishes. I would ask every date I have, if they transitioned or used to be a man just to know what I am getting into. Have you ever wondered how many women would kick me out or cancel a date for merely suggesting that they could have been a man at some point? I am not suicidal",

And i also think we need to do more research on the mental side of this. Let me give an example of what i mean.\nIf someone comes to you and says they're suicidal and want to jump off a bridge. A. This is most likely caused by depression and B. You wouldnt encourage yhem to do it would you? Or drive em to the bridge yourself right? You would call a suicidr helpline for them or call emergency services or seek medical advice for them.\nSo homosexuality is similar in that instead of encouraging it we should help them seek advice for potential mentally related issues that may have caused them to reach this conclusion",

        "title": "CMV: why is it so hard to get a girlfriend? Because women on average are hypergamous, shallow, unintelligent, promiscuous only towards superior men, and lack honesty and moral code. Thats why. Change my view please.",
        "selftext": "Because the overwhelming majority of men dont accurately evaluate what women want going into relationships.\n\nObjectively, women are the gatekeepers to sex. You play your game and the woman selects you if you play better than others. If you refuse to play the game - or see it for the primordial mating ritual it truly is and the cesspool of emotionally-manipulated morons who are playing it, you will stay away as I did and consequently, miss out. As much as the modern-day third wave of feminists like to discredit hierarchies - by opposing existing ones or the need for new ones - what they dont realise is how they use these very hierarchies they ironically stand against to their advantage. Women are hypergamous - meaning they seek out men of a predominantly higher status. Social status is a potent aphrodisiac in women and they often universally find themselves irresistibly drawn towards powerful, controlling and douchey men. Its often the first kind of man theyll set their sights on before realising, after a few handful of heartbreaks, how these men will only satisfy their sexual needs leaving their emotional needs hanging. At this point and often nearing the end of their sexual prime, they will seek out to less dominant men who are more altruistic in a monogamous relationship.\n\nThe adage of alpha f*cks, beta bucks really does age well.\n\nNow people will tell me, well, you cant generalise womens sexual behaviours so grossly when theres probably someone like you out there. Certainly, but the statistical probability is much smaller than it is for atypical women seeking out a male partner with a similar temperament. This brings us to the variability hypothesis in social psychology that tells us women are, on average, more like each other i.e. homegenised. We see this in IQ distribution, distribution of personality traits, and heck even with the kind of hobbies and interests women take up across the board. Women generally play it safe and often stick to the easiest path destined for conformity.\n\nMen take risks which is what propels them into stardom or lands them smack on a street corner. This is why you have as many men living on the streets as you have successful men. Men populate the extremes within any society - something again the feminists probably never told you because it goes against their twisted narrative that men have it easy because of the patriarchy. When men win, they win spectacularly. Equally, when they loose, they loose miserably. Women dont. They loose small or win small, always choosing the middle ground somewhere along the line.\n\nA woman is prized for her sexuality - her fertility and beauty.\n\nA man is prized for his accomplishments - his social and material wealth.\n\nHer role in society is passive - to live on the receiving end. Yours is not. She can simply exist and she will be respected for it. She has freedom of choice, you dont. You cant just decide to stay at home one day wanting to detox your liver or get a pedicure. You cant take time for yourself and put your needs first. The satisfaction of your needs are conditional on what society thinks you deserve for your useful work. Men are groomed to be go-getters - to be focused with conquering the external world. Theres no time for self-care here. Nobody appreciates you simply for existing, for being human. You are appreciated for the dimensions of your trophy case you generously rack up over years of work.\n\nEsther Vilar, who was a self-described feminist of all things, famously said,\n\nMen have been trained and conditioned by women, not unlike the way Pavlov conditioned his dogs, into becoming their slaves. As compensation for their labours men are given periodic use of a woman's vagina.\n\nFor men, especially when theyre young, chances that women will find you attractive unless youre physically or socially on top of your game are slim to none. Young men havent had enough time to do their thing and attain a high status - theyre still new in the game. Its often told on online forums that womens sexual behaviour, in the absence of cultural impediments, borders on the sociopathic - very similar to those of the alpha men who are unapologetically ruthless with their sexual pursuits. Research has also shown that ovulating women are more likely to engage in agressive sexual behaviour - often why women in sexually-liberated cultures try to get f*cked by some bad boy alpha they wish they could tame with their sexuality at a sketchy bar under the guise of girls night out. Its ironic that the very male behaviours that women complain about and claim to stand against - being ruthless, selfish, remorseless - they subtly reward thereby helping reinforce. The only reason douchebags even exist in such large numbers is because women incentivise such ruthless sexual behaviour. Research has also substantiated this, showing how among male and female participants, the greatest discrepancy between stated words and actual behaviour occurred in the females - showing how women were more dishonest about their needs. This could in-part be due to their evolutionary need to socially fit in and not be perceived as being sexually aggressive or stereotyped. In fact, women are more dishonest overall especially where honesty could spell social exclusion.\n\nThe negatively-connotated male behaviour is in-fact a survival strategy men had to adopt to stay relevant, genetically, and to avoid having to finish last. Heres Camille Paglia, American feminist noted for her intellectual rigor and skepticism of culture on male sexual behaviour.\n\nThat nature acts differently upon the sexes is proved by the test case of modern male and female homosexuality, illustrating how the sexes function separately outside social conventions. The results, according to statistics of sexual frequency: male satyriasis and female nesting. The male homosexual has more sex than his heterosexual counterpart; the female homosexual less often than hers, a radical polarization of the sexes along a single continuum of shared sexual nonconformity. Male aggression and lust are the energizing factors in culture. They are mens tools of survival in the pagan vastness of female nature.\n\nConsistent with Paglias commentary, we find modern-day studies showing how men alter their behaviour - for the worse - in the presence of women. Its not that these men are acting out of poor judgement of their own, but often that women select these poorly-behaved men for sex. In other words, male aggression and ruthlessness seem to be a sexually-selected traits.\n\nYou sometimes have to answer a woman according to her womanishness, just as you have to answer a fool according to his folly.\n\n-George Bernard Shaw\n\nOnly a player can follow the womans unspoken rulebook of romantic conduct. The sheer lack of transparency, subtlety and unspoken rules you have to follow here are way out of the reach of most men, let alone their conscience. I can never respect any woman, or human for that matter, who cannot exercise their own moral judgement. But women will tell you how you have to be able to read their minds and how explicitly stating ones emotional needs ruins the magic. Its this bullshit why psychopaths win women effortlessly - because theyre able to make you feel special - by seeing right through your insecurities and deeply-held desires and giving you exactly that - only with malicious intent.\n\nThe first-rate woman is a realist. She sees clearly that, in a world dominated by second-rate men, the special capacities of the second-rate man are esteemed above all other capacities and given the highest rewards, and she endeavors to get her share of those rewards by marrying a second-rate man at the top of his class.\n\n-H.L. Mencken\n\nMost women Ive studied in relationships or otherwise are terribly naive - and they want to stay that way because they love living off that fantasy. They often do not know what kind of intent their partner has or conversely. Its the sheer ambiguity that makes these relationships work. I swear, if men and women were to become honest to a fault one day, the divorce courts would be running at full capacity. You cannot have honesty when you want to let magic, mystery and emotion thrive. You can only have honesty when relationships are founded on logic, principles or morals. Honesty ruins the magic - the fantasy of romance - that women crave for.\n\nWomen want to feel small in the vicinity of the man they admire. Admire, yes. Admiration is a whole lot different from mutual respect. I want mutual respect, not someone to look up to me like Im some God. Im unfortunately not that egotistical. They want mystery and lies, sugarcoated under the guise of romance. Things that are unattainable when you see her as an equal. You cannot go, from one woman to the next, asking her out if you didnt see them as worthwhile human beings. You could only find the impetus to do that if you viewed them as sub-human creatures who couldnt think or act for themselves. This is precisely how players approach women - the very kind of men they naively call confident, assertive and charismatic. Because when they see just how easy it is to play your instincts against you, they lose all respect. Same thing happened with me. When I was being honest, talking openly, being vulnerable - nobody gave a rats ass. But suddenly, when I was DJing one night at a fraternity party, a lot of them - even the ones that Id believed were intelligent and wouldnt be consumed by their evolutionary biology did - which destroyed all respect I had for them. In this case, I really didnt have to do much work besides projecting a sense of authority relevant to the situation. Its very hard for me to see women as equals the more I examine them. It perhaps works in the womans favour that men dont understand them for if they did, with good certainty, they would only feel disgusted.\n\nThat was the quality that made her easy to control. Her blind admiration. That and her abilities made her the perfect candidate to be my subordinate. This is a lesson you might want to take to heart as well, Toshiro. Admiration, is a state furthest away from understanding.\n\n-Sosuke Aizen\n\nNo men who really think deeply about women retain a high opinion of them; men either despise women or they have never thought seriously about them.\n\n-Otto Weininger\n\nWomen rely on proxies to social affluence or status, more so that men. If a man already has a long list of girlfriends or women wanting to befriend him, the woman perceives him as a much higher-status male despite having done nothing, in actuality, to earn this title. Wearing a tuxedo would fetch you romantic interest from women because they see your clothing as a proxy to your status. Similarly, if he acts recklessly, they take that as a sign of genetic fitness - often explaining the sexual allure of bad boys - when he might really just be stupid. Unlike men, who rely on explicitly-available information, women rely mostly on implicit cues which are often misleading and can be cleverly gamed. The majority of men have learned to cleverly weaponise this emotional fallibility (in women) to solicit romantic interest and sexual favours.\n\nIn this age of social media name-calling, people would love to jump aboard the bandwagon hoping to discredit me by calling me a sexist, misogynist or the number of other make-believe labels they slap on to anyone who challenges their beliefs. Because in their minds, discrediting you is equivalent to discrediting your argument - which is just poor logic.\n\nThe man who is not superficial, who has depth of thought as well as of purpose, the depth which not only makes him desire right but endows him with determination and strength to do right, must always look on woman from the oriental standpoint.\n\n-Friedrich Nietzsche\n\nAt this point, I dont think any truly intelligent man with strong morals will be seen as attractive. Men who refuse to play games are simply boring, not thrilling. Studies have also shown that high IQ men tend to retain their celibacy longer into adulthood than their less-gifted counterparts. Continuing on that note, we also find that intelligent women also engage in less promiscuity. Also, before you leave, check out these graphs from the infamous okcupid experiment that goes to prove that you dont have a personality if you dont look good in the dating market.\n\n\nNot to mention women are oblivious (or choose not to care) about substance, just presentation. In-fact, women were easily manipulated in one study using luxury goods, whereas men didnt care.\n\n\nI say women because, unlike men who are framed by modern culture for having high standards, its women who care more about looks. Men are in-fact more forgiving of physical imperfections.\n\n\nDue to high parental investment, women are forced to be opportunistic with their romantic endeavors. Men often assume the idealistic role, hoping for the best. This is seen with new findings from Pew[1] that show women are more inclined to solicit information on ones occupation, height and physical characteristic while dating. In all, women are more choosy and choosiness is going to dispossess scores of men - as exemplified by questions like the one youre reading!\n\nMen are always going to be the disposable sex by virtue of their biology ._. - Shrey R. \n\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/02/06/users-of-online-dating-platforms-experience-both-positive-and-negative-aspects-of-courtship-on-the-web/",

That just can't be. Unless my taste is extremely flawed, there is virtually no difference between Pepsi and Coke other than branding. In fact, I'd be willing to bet that if you swapped the labels of two bottles, the vast majority of people would continue drinking them as if nothing had changed (or wouldn't be able to tell the difference).

        "selftext": "I was looking up \"white fragility\" CMVs and came across this comment from /u/TheonBall on a popular post 8 months ago and found it to be a good analogy for explaining the concept:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/htghgw/cmv\\_the\\_idea\\_of\\_white\\_fragility\\_is\\_racist\\_isnt/fyh9o3a/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/htghgw/cmv_the_idea_of_white_fragility_is_racist_isnt/fyh9o3a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nPlease read the entire analogy from the link above, but here's the inferior TLDR:\n\n&gt;A company's customer service department sucks. Every other department is doing pretty good. Someone points out how much customer service department sucks. The customer service department says all departments need to be better and nit picks every other department's minor faults. The dispersal of blame is analogous to \"white fragility\".\n\n**Earn a delta:** Show that TheonBall's original analogy is *not* a good example for explaining the concept of \"white fragility\". If you do think it's a good analogy, keep going.\n\n*Anti-delta:* Argue that this CMV is an example of \"white fragility\" because it avoids the topic of race. I'm only interested in meta-discussion about an analogy to \"white fragility\", not about concept of \"white fragility\" itself. If you want to talk about \"white fragility\" itself, make your own CMV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOK, now that we agree on the analogy, let's call this company Dunder Mifflin. The fragility being displayed we will call *\"customer service fragility\"*. I will make up name of people as I go along.\n\nHere's why I think Jane Doe (a decent entry-level employee in the Dunder Mifflin customer service department) might be uncomfortable with what transpired at the meeting:\n\n1. *Individual v. Group Responsibility* \\- When Jane Doe hears someone personify the customer service department (\"the customer service department says...\") she feels uncomfortable because only Betty Boss, Anna Angry, Cindy Chimesin and Rachel Rudeness were given a platform to speak to the entire company. She also wants to be recognized for her sometimes good / sometimes not-bad performance as distinct from Anna Angry's constantly abysmal performance. *Jane is uncomfortable that other individuals in the company appear to be trying to associate the words and actions of a visible few with an entire group through the label \"customer service department\".*\n2. *Spurious correlation* \\- Someone reassures Jane that most people in the company know that not everyone in the customer service department is a problem. They just use that term because the clear majority of problems come from the customer service department. But Jane doesn't see anything inherent to the creation of a customer service department that would cause the awful problems everyone agrees are happening. Instead she see other company's sales departments struggling with similar issues and only sees bad leadership as the common ingredient. *Jane feels uncomfortable because she feels like her colleagues are focusing on a spurious correlation rather than a causation.*\n3. *Narrow vision* \\- Jane feels that the issues at Dunder Mifflin are caused by Betty Boss and her direct reports creating a culture that doesn't require employees to respect customers and doesn't demote bad employees. Some customer service employees still try to do the right thing, but she thinks that leadership is too accommodating to bad employees. *Jane feels uncomfortable that if the company thinks of these issues as a \"customer service department problem\" rather than a \"leaders not promoting respect\" problem, that other departments will inevitably have the same problems when they hire the next \"Betty Boss\".*\n\n**Earn a delta:** Using the original analogy add another reason why Jane Doe might be uncomfortable *or* show that she couldn't reasonably be uncomfortable for any of the reasons I listed\n\n*Anti-delta:* Argue that Jane Doe *should* feel uncomfortable. I'm not taking a position on the intent or desired outcome, just *why* someone in Jane's position would react with discomfort.",

From their POV, joint military exercises is a reminder that the US/SK coalition are not ready for a diplomatic solution (peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula) but is more interested in finishing the Korean War. INB4 some of you claim that NK is effectively doing the same thing with their nuclear weapons program, the counter-claim is simple: the only country that has ever used a nuclear weapon on a civilian population is the US, a country that has also amassed several thousand nuclear weapons.\n\n2) Waste of American taxpayer money. Joint military exercises are done around the world to give politicians another excuse to continue pouring trillions into the military industrial complex when that money could and should be spent on infrastructure, education, etc. The US military needs the threat of perpetual conflict and war in order to justify its spending. That's why the [US has hundreds of foreign military bases across the world while China has four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_overseas_military_bases).\n\nIt's very possible the US military knowingly holds military exercises with SK in order to negate any chance of a peaceful diplomatic resolution with NK precisely because a united Korean peninsula = no Korean military base = less justification for military spending = less $$$ going into politicians pockets from \"campaign donations\" from corporations like Northrup Grumman or Lockheed Martin.",

Like 12 year olds are sitting down in health class and learning about how great that tits are? What if I say women are taught to like testicles?\n\n\"There's men who just want women to be equal. It's not about their desires!\"\n\nYes. Yes it is. When men tell you that's the case ofc you'll believe that just because it comes from the dude's mouth and if you're a girl, since you don't know what being a guy is like all you can go by is what you've heard men say. I don't blame you for thinking I'm different or something, but I'm sure most dudes would agree. They probably won't say anything out of fear of offending someone or sounding sexist. No there's no sexism involved in men just not wanting children and family members to go topless in public. It's a safety concern. It isn't a war on nipples. We don't hate your nipples.\n\n\"Equality..\"\n\nYes, I 100% support equality. That's why discomfort against the ftn campaign is kinda hard to express. We aren't saying we don't want you to be equal to us and there's no hate involved. It's all about protecting people. Equality is a concern but there must be different ways of going about it.\n\nLets say women had no genitals and could walk around in public with their pants off. Now lets say there was a movement of men who want the ability to expose their testicles.. on beaches, sidewalks, and even the neighborhood playground.. Is it much different? no. Testicles are just skin! No.. no they're not. Don't let men have the same luxury to keep their pants off then. Simple, but you still want men to have the same rights as you? So keep your pants on. Men don't NEED to go topless either.\n\n\"But freedom!\"\n\nYeah and I should have the freedom to steal a 7 year old's icecream cone. If a man cares about equality surely they'll keep their shirts on for it. It doesn't have to be that hard. While we're at it I don't condemn not wearing bras so long as your not showy about them to family members and children, just like how men don't show their nipples off to children and family either. It's just pretty creepy is all and I'm sure nobody wants to see that.\n\n\"Haha, think of the children? yeah..\"\n\nDon't get me wrong, when kids are young they have no sexual understanding and breasts are just a curiosity, but just like many other developments kids have, eventually there's a time where they will start understanding sex and they will develop sexual thoughts. At this time the topic is a lot different. You don't feel comfortable even thinking about kids when it comes to sex, right? Well breasts, to a young boy is no different then a vagina.\n\nTo conclude I just wanna say that I know I'm going to get hate for this post. Some might not read it through and just spew word vomit. That's what makes it Reddit though lol. Please be civil and don't make it about anger (if you really want to make a real argument and don't just be snarky and higher than thou. We're all people here with our own thoughts. No judgement.) \n\np.s If I don't respond to your comment it's probably just a good point and I'll be sure to store it away into my brain.",

So as a reminder, it's this on top of all the other shit Nintendo has pulled in recent times, stuff like 3d all stars, the smash melee tournament cancelation, the joy con boys ban, Nintendo's partner program etc. etc. So what did Nintendo do this time? They issued a c&amp;d on a channel called \"super mario logan\". Now sml isn't exactly the best youtuber out there. The content is mediocre at best and there is a lot of open behind the scenes drama for a plush channel but that's besides the point. The channel makes puppet shows / skits with mario plushies. Now this guy had a massive fanbase mostley consisting of kids. In the grand scheme of things, this was actually really good for nintendo since this channel provided marketing for their products for fortnite fans who couldn't give a shit about nintendo. Seriously so many of mario logan's bought mario plushies because of logan, even I did when I was a shitty edgelord fan. I mean just look at the fan meetup that logan did in new york. Almost all the kids were holding nintendo switches and mario plushies. Nintendo had nothing to gain from issuing a c&amp;d and frankly they had plenty to loose.",

        "selftext": "Before I start I want to get establish a few things about myself. First, I would never support violence in any form against someone for any reason. I have several close friends who are transgender and I make a maximum effort to make make feel loved and supported. Second, I'm an older guy and know that I am not as familiar with proper terminology as I could be so please give me the benefit of the doubt if I phrase things poorly. I'm really trying to keep an open mind and learn.\n\nWith that said, I have a line so to speak in terms of how I view transgender persons. If someone identifies as a different gender than their biological gender and wants to \"emulate\" certain characteristics (wearing your hair a certain way, cross dressing, etc.) I say go for it. I support and encourage 100% unlimited self expression in those regards. \n\nHowever when it comes to medically/physically altering your body, I have a serious mental block with that. If you choose to express yourself in the ways I described above that seems to me like a conscious choice that does not harm anyone in the process. But if you start cutting parts of your body off or pumping your body full of hormones then you are now causing yourself undue harm by destroying/altering the form/function of otherwise healthy/functional organs/appendages. \n\nIn any other context most societies would view this as self mutilation - something that isn't supported. We all get a sense of uneasiness from botched plastic surgeries for example and even the most progressive institutions in our culture don't think twice about critiquing some ridiculous boob job or lip injection. \n\nSo why should I view it differently in the context of gender reassignment? Why would I ever want to encourage someone to go to the lengths of surgery when it seems like they could express themself to such a large degree without it?",

        "title": "CMV: Unwavering loyalty to a sports team, especially in the face of drastic change, is foolish.",
        "selftext": "Whenever I have a brand that is no longer meeting my standards of quality for anything, I am not afraid to abandon it to seek a more worthwhile brand. For example, it doesn't matter if I loved Samsung products for as long as I've been alive. Tomorrow, if Samsung released their next phone and gutted every feature that I've loved about them and replaced them with what I feel to be completely subpar traits or components, I'd make the switch to iPhone. Another example would be my shoes. I spent most of my teenage years wearing Converse shoes. I liked the style and the culture associated with the shoes. But as I got older, I began to realize that other shoe brands were more comfortable and often more durable, and despite what I believed to be a long term brand loyalty, I switched brands to something I enjoyed more. There is no shame in coming to a conclusion that something is no longer meeting your expectations and are in the market for something that you have more faith in.\n\nI believe that I understand loyalty, but I feel that loyalty comes from a place of love and respect for a product or brand. Sports teams should be no different. They are representatives in a league that people watch for entertainment.\n\nWhile I don't follow sports very closely, I've enjoyed watching games occasionally. If I don't like what I'm seeing from a team on the screen, I find myself not enjoying that team as a whole. Meanwhile, I have friends who watch their teams lose every game, every season, for multiple years, actively criticizing their players, their coaches, and their performance, but still feel that they have to be committed to their team because \"it's the way that it's always been\".\n\nI know this following scenario doesn't happen as much in traditional sports like football, baseball, hockey, and the like. However, for other leagues like e-sports, it's not completely uncommon for teams to sign entirely new rosters, including coaches, every few seasons. But even in that community, people feel obligated to stick with their team no matter what. The loyalty to a logo and a name is so bizarre when there are players, coaches, and performances that don't match up to standards that they hold.\n\nAs I'm sure with many sports fans, there is a die-hard commitment to their team as they take it as a form of identify, but why do people choose to identify with teams that are, year after year, associated with repeated losses and failures? I've seen people who claim to be \"ashamed to be a fan\" of teams after particular bad performances, but why do they feel the need to stay active in that circle?\n\nSports teams are a brand, with players who act as representatives for their brand. But rather than being committed to the parts that make the machine move, they're more interested in seeing their logo be dominant above all else. Part of me believes that if every single member, non-player staff included (minus the owner), of an NFL team like the Pittsburgh Steelers, would all leave the team to form a new team, including a brand new logo and name, there would still be an absolutely enormous following for the Steelers. They would talk about players and coaches that they want their team to sign and continue on their way. But why? Why do people worship a logo with no care of the names behind the face?\n\nI know this doesn't apply to every single sports fan, but I can't fathom the idea of unapologetic loyalty to a sports team who do not meet the standards of performance that one holds in a team. It should not be such a taboo subject to \"switch teams\" when someone decides that they prefer another team and should not be labeled as a \"bandwagon jumper\" because they suddenly find themselves enjoying watching another team more than their own.\n\nI am willing to change my view on this topic if someone can convince me that there is a benefit to tying one ever-changing sports team with their identity. \n\nI understand that some people are looking at a sports team as their identity within a community, but it doesn't make sense to me that, once you pick a team, you are forever locked to being with that team.",

        "selftext": "I agree that there are many points in which a person can stop and go back before -for example- shooting up on some heroine, however, that same person does not just wake up one day and think to themselves \"hey, let's get addicted to heroine\". \n\nI mostly believe that addiction is not a choice because the substance taken is normally able to modify both the reward system of the brain and impulse control of the user. \n\nFirst, I want to explain the way I see the brains reward system (no trying to sound condescending, this is really just for anyone that may not know what the reward system is as I do not know how common or not knowing this is);\n\nBrain's Reward System: This system is essentially a brain circuit that allows a person to feel pleasure  (dopamine) when it is turned on, for example, by eating, having sex or winning something like a race. When this system is activated, the brain takes note of what it is doing and the fact that it is worth remembering and repeating in the future (to 'release' more dopamine). \n\nThe thing is, drugs that are normally used by people (painkillers, etc.) can create an increase in activity of the reward pathway by increasing dopamine transmissions. Thus, due to the way the human brain is designed, and because of the way these drugs activate a particular brain pathway for rewards, they can be abused. Drugs can also trigger a biological and behavioral response to engage in addictive behavior again, despite knowing the negative consequences or even no longer finding joy in doing drugs. \n\nSecond, some may think that taking drugs is just an impulse control issue but drugs also alter one's impulse control ability. \n\nThe prefrontal cortex is a part of the brain involved in inhibiting impulsivity and delaying gratification; however, addiction affects the prefrontal cortex. It impacts it in such a way that is alters one's impulse control and judgement. This results in a pathological pursuit for rewards (brains reward system). This can also be a way for addicts to feel 'normal' again. \n\nSo, CMV...

        "selftext": "Forced diversity is used with good intent however the trade-offs are often too large.\n\nFirstly when it comes to employment FD can lessen a companys ability to make Befitting hires. In some places There are ethnicity quotas that business have to adhere to. And failure to do so often results in financial penaltys. In some circumstances this can result in a less qualified candidate receiving a job simply because they are not a minority which isnt good for company efficiency. And if a minority is hired they are often assumed to be the diversity hire and people may also assume they are employed due to their skin colour/sexuality rather than merit which isnt true in most cases. These quotas are a burden on businesses and can often create an adverse effect.\n\nSecondly, in films, TV and books it can be completely unnecessary and ruin the historical accuracy. I understand the importance of been represented on screen but the representation should appear naturally. The instance where J.K Rowling announced that Dumbledore was gay after the books release feels unnecessary and forced. If youre going to reveal/confirm characters to be gay at the very end of a story or after, it should at least be in keeping with and fit contextually with everything that has come before. And the Instance where the BBC casted a black woman as a historic English queen in The Hollow Crown it doesnt fit in with the setting at all and ruins its historical integrity.\n\nAnd thirdly, in the military and special forces simply put it is dangerous. There have recently been suggestions to lower the entry requirements for the S.A.S to allow for more female soldiers. The criteria is tough to meet for a reason. the situations they deal with need to be met with the highest expertise and physical capability. If a person on a task force is their for diversity purposes and not because of their ability it can endanger not only their life but civilian lives as-well.\n\nDiversity is a great and meaningful thing but it must be dealt with properly. When forced it can bring forth serious ramifications.\n\nI would also like to say that I am not against diversity itself but, instead against forced diversity.

It's no different. At least this way, one can be provided with an outlet for their violent tendencies in a regulated environment. And, what? You think just because UFC has stricter rules, that means people will carry those rules onto the street when committing crimes? That they'll arbitrarily hold back just because the people on TV do?

        "selftext": "A lot of sexual kinks and porn feature situations that are usually considered pretty morally abhorrent, including rape, incest, cheating, abuse of power, sexism, blackmail, and more. Lots of hugely popular porn involves these things; in fact its sometimes hard to find porn without these things unless you specifically look for it. Criticizing peoples sex and masturbation habits is often considered off limits, and people get defensive if you criticize the fact that people have kinks and enjoy porn with these things in them. But I think we should be more active in criticizing the presence of immoral things in sex and porn. If a mainstream movie was released that uncritically portrayed rape as hot, it would be rightfully torn to shreds for promoting dangerous and unethical ideas about sex and consent. So why is that sort of stuff par for the course when it comes to porn? \n\nIm not saying rape porn necessarily causes real rape or anything like that, but if I watch, say, egregiously misogynistic porn every day, thats almost certainly going to have some effect on how I view women, at least when it comes to sex.\n\nPeople can have kinks. If someones into piss play, I might think thats kinda gross, but its not really creating pleasure from something immoral. However, I think many popular kinks pretty obviously involve some horrible behavior, and I think that should be recognized and these behaviors discouraged.\n\nIm not anti-porn or sex negative, and I dont think that anyone who enjoys sex or porn with morally dubious elements is a bad person - I know Ive done it. But I think its important to recognize that some sexual desires are just not healthy, and we shouldnt be uncritically catering to our worst urges.",

All you really need to do to study for a test is memorize a few names/dates or facts (science and history) or have a basic understanding of using certain formulas (chemistry, physics, math) and you should receive a passing grade. So the way I see it, is that these tests that we study for, are really there to test our memory rather then our knowledge, as all we really need to do is memorize some definitions or facts. \n\nAnd then on top of that, once we hand in the test, we immediately forget all of the information we just studied, as we want to make room for new information in our brain for our next test (cycle continues). So we dont even remember what we studied for after we took the test. How is that an accurate way to teach us?\n\nA better way to give students actual motivation to learn, and a chance to apply what they learned into use, is to assign them a project in their given course similar to one they may encounter in the real world.

Negging is where you give someone a compliment and then say something negative about them. Not talking to the girl shows disinterest which is meant to make them like you more. And touching them innocently to get them comfortable with you.\n\nSo when you are fully aware of it, it does sound like it is manipulation and even reading that i'm sure some people were like 'ew so bad'. But in reality, I think that's what most dating is.\n\nPeacocking is just dressing up and looking good to go out and impress someone. Negging is just banter between people.

And touch is a natural form of communication between humans and makes people more comfortable.\n\nI do think a lot of PUA guys come across as jerks and sure some of them might be but their 'tactics' aren't wrong, or trickery or unethical.

        "title": "CMV: Our ideas of love are deeply flawed, and romanticism is to blame.",
        "selftext": "This is a topic I have strong feelings about, and something many of my friends disagree with me. I dont really know what the best way to start is, but I guess a good way is by discussing the concept of the one, something fairy tales and animated films love to depict. Like when Anna stumbles into Kristoff, or when Rapunzel literally falls in love with the first man she meets, and so on. While people are obviously aware that these stories are fake, somehow our general perception of love and our expectation for relationships are similar. I think this notion of love (which is really just lust in the honeymoon phase) is very flawed and actually *harmful* to relationships for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, to regard any companion as destined or the one understates the fact that relationships are susceptible to change. Yes, there are couples who genuinely and passionately love each other for their entire lives; but for the majority of people, this is not the case. Even among the most loving couples there are often moments of bitter disagreements, a sudden lack of attraction, or even regrets of entering the relationship. And what do these couples do? They talk it out and resolve their differences. Their relationship works not because they are destined for one another, but because they actually put in the work to stick together. Ive seen way too many of my friends break up with their long-term partners *solely* because they didnt feel the same way as they did before, and I think this is a real tragedy. It is inherently impossible to always \"feel the same way\" when feelings aren't dependable.\n\nThe other harm is related to our expectations. High expectations are generally harmful, as any disappointment appears incredibly crushing. When we consider someone to be our soulmate or the one, this idea usually comes with the heightened expectation that they should know us well or be able to understand our thoughts. Now this is a very romantic idea, but I think its also a quite foolish expectation. An example is when we are uncertain whether our SO still likes us, but we dont say it because we want them to demonstrate their love. Or when we want them to know our preferences, spend the afternoon with us, etc. but we want them to guess. The basis of a healthy relationship is good communication, and I think a good first step is to eliminate any hope that our partners should be our soulmate.\n\nSo, what do I think love is about? I personally believe that the feeling of attraction is nothing more than a mixture of **memories** and **biological processes**, and that we should really view love more as tolerance and accompany. We are all fundamentally flawed as humans, from annoying quirks to personality weaknesses. As such, true love is not when someone magically suits you and you live happily ever after. Rather, it is when **people decide to cut slack for each other while working together towards a better life**. It is when you dont immediately get annoyed over your SOs habits, because you are willing to interpret it in a kinder, gentler way. I think there is a real difference between accepting someones flaws and be willing to overlook it.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading my poorly written post. Im really curious as to what you think about this!",

        "selftext": "If I recall correctly from my history classes there were always oppressed and oppressor, just how Marx stated.\nHowever, previously in history there was a reason behind it. Christian were oppressed because they didn't like Romans, heresy was destabilising Christian sociateies. Slaves made a lot of profit. But after IIWW, there was almost only racism in the USA, but it is not world wide, so I would discard it. \n\nLately there is a big rise of SJW all around the globe. Quick description of SJW is that this is a person who seeks offensive things and loudly states that this thing is offensive. SJW is looking for potential victims of given statement/solution/situation etc. We can safely say that SJW fights for good and happy sociaty, and that's OK! In fact, it is a great ambition and I think that everyone should thrive to this.\n\nHowever, SJWs are playing victims. If I say that \"The women are statistically weaker than men\" which is a fact, the SJW will respond with anger and disbelief. SJW would act like he is a victim of this statement. Like this statement was a personal insult.\n\nThat's why I believe that we are experiencing a rise of post-victim society. We no longer have real victims. Now we have people who look for victims, and they are playing victims themselves. More and more people are getting angry and playing a victim, when they shouldn't. These people are becoming a victims, because they want to be victims. Why? Jung has an answer: \"victims mentality\".",

To me this shows little faith in the systems put in place to handle these very issues. Systems that were created and maintained by these politicians. If they dont trust that the system is effective to work for them how can the average person trust it themselves.\n\nI also think it shows hypocrisy because different politicians will only speak up about it when it effects certain people. For example AOC should also be calling for Bidens resignation because hes been  accused and she seems to feel the same way about him. And the news treats people letting the situation play out as a negative thing. \n\nSo yeah I dont think theres anything wrong with having a personal opinion based on whatever but to call for someone to be fired, resign or anything, prior to a full investigation is wrong \n\nCMV",

Viewing China's rise as a zero-sum game with the US and Europe is only going to make conflict more likely. If we assume this is true, then Western countries should be doing more to *reduce* tensions with China, not inflame them, and journalists need to realise the role they play in manufacturing consent.\n\nMy concern is further validated by the UK's decision to raise its cap on the number of nuclear warheads, suggesting intel thinks there is an increased risk of conflict, but rather than making efforts to prevent decent into military action, the government would rather stock up on warheads.\n\nThe cold war was an horrific era of human history, and one that must be prevented from reoccurring, particularly since it was more luck than judgement that meant we escaped the last one mostly unscathed.

(My stance here is obvious, but don't get caught up in it please, I'm not looking to challenge this one). \n\nSo when the front page basically has memes about how the world is silent on the Uyghur Genocide in Xingjiang (from my perspective, it's gotten unusual levels of attention) and people are basically in universal agreement... I'm skeptical. \n\nMy skepticism comes from the knowledge that anti-Chinese sentiment is at a high. In the West, hate crimes against Asian peoples is up - in no small part spurred up by a desire to blame them over Covid.

My opinion is that it should be something you can easily remember, so you don't have to write it down or store it anywhere. Not easily guessable, but perhaps if you live at 37 Maple Drive and your middle name is Sarah, it could be SarMap37 or something like that. \n\n\n\n\nMy reasoning is that, unless someone has easy access to your exact password (if you write it down on a sticky note or send it in an email or something) or can guess it (like Password or 12345678) they would likely need some kind of system to search through even combination of numbers and letters to find yours, so it doesn't really matter what that combo is. An unnecessarily complex password just means you have to store it somewhere (like a password tracker) which I view as inherently less safe than an easy-to-remember password. \n\n\n\n\nI do understand that using the same password for everything is less safe, so let's assume a dynamic password where you change some element of it for every website (for example, SarMap37!, SarMap37#, SarMap37$)",

A lottery system for entry only means many kids who arent mentally equipped for advanced courses will fail and many smarter kids will have their promise smothered. More teachers is the answer, not randomizing opportunity for students.",
        "selftext": "Its been happening in more and more cities; high performance public schools and classes are being completely gutted and criteria for entry is being thrown away. Traditionally, your child could test into these schools at any point. If they were slower to develop in K-2, you could test at 3rd grade and get in (same all the way through 12th grade). School districts truly wanted their brightest pupils to succeed. Most districts that Im aware of even had teacher or administrator recommendation, for students who didnt know or actively seek out the advanced program.\n\nI could sympathize with the idea that this has traditionally minimized the ability of kids from low income areas to rise up, often times people of color. Many of them dont have the opportunities or parenting availability that the kids from other neighborhoods would to get ahead. This is a perfectly valid concern for the system I outlined in my first paragraph. However, what the school districts have done is a complete bastardization of the solution. By randomizing entry to advanced courses and taking any merit out of consideration, theyve set both sets of kids (advanced and typical performers) up for failure. \n\nAdvanced courses carry extra homework, reading, testing, and classroom expectations. The curriculum is harder and faster paced. If you put students who dont have the drive to succeed, in that kind of environment, they will fail. Conversely, you will completely squander the potential of students with an aptitude for learning. Some kids just excel more in academia and thats OK, but choosing to intentionally withhold them from advanced placement or magnet programs for the sake of equity is intentionally harmful. You could be preventing the next generation of brilliant minds from developing to their full potential. \n\nThis creates another set of issues that feeds back in a harmful feedback loop. Kids coming from middle and upper middle class homes will be placed into private school as a means of ensuring quality education. This will remove a large chunk of kids that could be growing up in a diverse and interesting environment, and will place them in a separate ecosystem, separated by wealth. This in turn will mean more parents will be less interested in funding public schools, because their kids arent in it. That means more people will want to leave, which furthers the stigma that the school system is failing. All of that will mean the system will stop building schools, stop hiring more teachers, and will lower the standard of curriculum for advanced courses, because the remaining students wont be able to keep up. \n\nThe solution is not to randomize high performance classes, but rather to increase the quality of all students education through building new schools and hiring FAR MORE TEACHERS. I taught in middle school history in inner city public schools a while back, I had 32 kids packed into an old room, 19 computers, 30 desks and only 31 chairs (one student per day got to use my chair). No para-educators. Every class was like this. I had one class per day that had 18 students and it was marvelous. No fights, higher grades, better relationships with students and parents. It wasnt even a high performing class, it was remedial reading. Not one of those students would have been better off by being shoved into an advanced placement course.",

Can't I live in private with the love of my choice in peace without the public knowing and it being like I am hiding something?\n\nJournalists should stop the \"Are you dating?\" \"Are you seeing someone?\" Type of questions. My private life should be out of bounds of public domain and nobody has the right to know about it and it should be not like I am hiding something. Like does it matter if someone is straight/queer? Why do people think it's a must that people must have partners or date or marry or cohabit for that sake. Like why do people think if a single person is not dating anyone he's presumably queer or he's trying to hide something?

Their whole platform as I see it is: Attack the opposition first, and address issues never. \n\nTelling me what the Democrats are doing will NOT change my mind. What will change my mind is actual substantial Republican arguments that are MORE than \"Stop the Democrats\" at heart.",

There reasoning being and I quote \" a child doesnt need to be on speed\". Which at first glance u might think \"what a boomer thing to say\". Seeing kids with add and adhd \"need\" this medication to function properly. Well that's bullshit. My friend ( we'll call N) surprisingly also had ADD. He was diagnosed when he was 8. But his mom actually put him on medication. First a Methylphenidate Patch. Then adderall when he got older. He explained to me the feeling of being a zombie. Feeling like your on autopilot. Not even able to think about food. I remember during that time me and N went from walking around town and bullshiting around too just sitting in his house playing video games. All N would do was go too school, go home to play video games, and go to sleep everyday. Now this too u might sound just like a child being addicted to games but this didnt really start till after the got medicated. It was like it wasnt my best friend anymore for a little bit. \n\nThen there my friend H. To keep things short he had horrible ADHD. Taking medication from 9 all the way too 16. At the end they were prescribing in 5mg desoxyn a day (Racemic Methamphetamine). He was staying up for days sometimes. Getting delusional hallucinations at night from the stimulus psychosis. That's when is parents took him off.\n\nThen I decided to try adderall. No I did not get is prescribed but I was curious. And of course. That feeling of being a zombie. The best way I can describe it to someone without add is like being lethargic with energy. Think of that zombie/autopilot mode u feel when your really tired. Expect your not tired just feeling that zombie feeling. After the 5 hours extreme anxiety for 3 hours. Then I couldn't go to sleep.\n\n\nI completely understand some people need these meds.  Just like some people need opiates or benzos. But I feel Doctors, Parents, and socitey feels like Stimulants 90% the right way too go. I havent personally known someone with adhd that didnt get prescribed a super addictive stimulant. There are plenty of other drugs too that could help with less side effect but doctors never try those first it seems. They just give them adderal or ritalin and call it a day.\n\nSo, too end this post. I really feel u should be atleast at a age where u fan completly comprehend the addictivness, precautions, and side effects of these drugs.",

I love my mother, but life is just too unbearable.\n\nSo my question is not wheter there is an egoistical, hedonic reason to keep on living for myself (as a promortalist I am convinced non-existence to be inherently better than existence so pls don't try to change my view on that as every justification to keep on living for oneself is just survival instinct and the irrational fear of death camouflaged as a (biased) reason (excuse)), but wheter there is a reason, a sort of an ethical obligation I have towards my mother.\n\nOne of the reasons I ask this is, obviously, due to my survival instinct at play, so I would be deceiving myself that I'm not trying to find a justification to keep playing this egoistical, hedonic zero-sum addiction that is life (by which I mean my meaningless, irrational dreams, passions and ambitions in life). Picking up a fight against 4 billion years of evolution is fucking hard.\n\nThe root of my promortalistic belief is not my depression btw, if that's what you thought is the case. About 3 months ago, I was very happy and motivated, and I still believed that I was better of dead. The reason for that was that I somehow tricked myself into believing that I have somewhat of an obligation towards my mom. I asked myself, who would suffer more (long-term)? My mom due to my suicide or myself if I keep on living this miserable life? I believed the former one to have a greater value, thus I kept on living and improving my mental state. I concluded, arguing from the POV of a (biased) negative utilitarianist, that I need to stay alive for my mom.\n\nHowever, I forgot the fact that I never asked for this life out of the equation.

Also, Canadian politics is pretty similar to American save for the public parts of the right being more sensible and not currently disgraced (this is coming from a Republican btw). The major problems are the difference in healthcare, Quebec, and merging of government.\n\nProblem 1: The US needs to do something with its healthcare and now. I dont really care if its to go universal or to go back to a private system (anyone who thinks we have a private system right now, just know that it isnt). But make it stable and then we can get to addressing it.\n\nProblem 2: wave goodbye to the part of Canada that obviously doesnt want to be a part of it and we can all be done with their whining. And this fixes a lot wrong with Canadas political system.\n\nProblem 3: Im a little biased, but they should join the US system. We would add the number of representatives proportional to the change in population (I worked it out and it came to 38 new representatives and 18 senators(this was really convenient). This would make the total of 473 reps and 118 senators for a total of 591 congressmen and congresswoman). From there just merge the systems. I dont see that many politicians actually coming over from Canada and instead sticking with Quebec as thats where pretty much every major position is from (this would help Canada with the problem of how most politicians are from Quebec because of stupid language laws). From there we should welcome Canadians with open arms.\n\nNow onto why I think we should do this. Its beneficial for both sides. Canada gets to take care of its problem with Quebec have a chokehold over their politics and allows US to have better deals with oil as Canada is one of our top three contributors of outside oil.
