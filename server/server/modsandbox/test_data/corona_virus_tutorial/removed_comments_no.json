Second of all, again, you people are being blaise about people dying enmasse. Nevermind simple dignity you aren't even acknowledging the reality that just because \"elderly age groups, which aren't exactly productive\" (fuck you for even saying it like that) aren't making cars or rockets or cell phones or whatever, just because they aren't producing things in a factory, doesn't mean they aren't as productive and critical or more so. For example on a personal note, my grandfather died unnecessarily and he was not \"productive\" economically but I assure you he was integral to my family and his widow will never be the same nor will any of their children. You people are callously reducing human life to statistics to sound cool for fake internet points. Furthermore it doesn't require even a tiny amount of effort to find resources contradicting your baseless claim: https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/lz1o18/a_year_into_the_pandemic_longterm_financial/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\nEven just logically thinking in terms of recent disasters look at 9/11? We are still cleaning up and paying for the survivors and medical bills of the heroes that raced into hell to save lives. For, in your type's words \"just\" 2977 deaths. What about the medical system which has been DECIMATED by this disease? Literally hundreds and thousands of doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals died taking tens of thousands of hardwon years of medical experience with them. That alone will take a decade to recover because that is about how much time it takes for a medical professional to go from mediocre to great. You people are simply completely out of touch with reality. Confidently incorrect. I'm sorry to be a Debbie Downer but I get fucking irritated when people don't even show a little respect for human life.

They are the ones delivering it. On that note, there was a huge scandal like the day before Biden assumed office where the Fed said fuck if we know how many vaccines we have in reserve. States were saying they didn’t know if they’d have enough to give people second doses so they started hoarding what should’ve been first doses. The Biden admin smoothed out communication so states know what deliveries to expect three weeks out. This allows for much better planning in terms of distribution. This is why you’ve seen the used % go from under 50 up to 80 in the last month or so. Also he signed a bunch of EOs for the DPA to be used to make vaccine materials, actually authorized the Nat Guard to open and run their own vaccine sites, and most recently helped broker a deal between J&J and Merck to produce more vaccines (art of the deal mother fuckers) so ya he has done a lot.",

And the doomers brought all their friends with them to mob anyone who dared to oppose the mandates even the slightest bit. It got BAD here. The types of things the people here cheered for in the name of mask wearing made me scared to be a part of the conversation.\n\nThat's why the reaction to the TX governor lifting all restrictions gave me some concern of that type of crowd coming back. But that kind of exposed a few things about what that type of crowd was when today I came on here and saw that things weren't as toxic as it got last night.

After being abused by customers for years, I hate to them. With every fiber of my being. They don’t deserve to have the vaccine, at least not before us. They should be forced to be exposed to the public, who often go maskless, and see how they like it. And guess what? A lot of people *did* leave work. A hidden reason why a lot of retailers cut store hours is that we literally didn’t have the staff to operate like normal. I stayed because of the vaccine and no other reason; we were told we’d get it early. The job has absolutely not been worth it otherwise, you work it either if you have no other choice or if you’re a kid. I’ve since had them heavily reduce my hours, I’m just covering people’s days off for now on. I worked 6 days a week this last year. I have other income that I can live off of with the right attitude, so the company has until the next customer goes Karen on me.",

By removing the mandate now store employees and management are going to waste time with Karen's, get frustrated, and after so many confrontations are just going to say screw it because a loud minority of people are too annoying to deal with.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of the guidelines last year, Seattle and San Francisco where the only cities that actually tried to do something and issue a shelter in place order before the CDC even issued a statement. Every other mayor, governor, senator, and member of congress was screaming on TV about how the government needs to do something. Then the CDC says uh ok, here are some guidelines we recommend (but are in no way mandatory) and literally within minutes local and state officials started issuing their stay at home orders and requiring masks.

Recently, you've even started saying to 'double mask' which to me sounds as stupid as doubling up condoms. \n\nNow, suddenly we need to act scared of virus variants? Study upon study is showing vaccines still having robust effectiveness amid mutations. Not to mention vaccine makers telling us that adapting to strains at this point is far easier to do if/when necessary.\n\nCDC - your reputation needs a couple years of solid advice that aligns with reality before I jump into that bs.\n\nAnd I'm a libtard masker too!",
