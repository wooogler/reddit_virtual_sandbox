I have to choose my major 2 or 3 months later.\n\nIn advance, sorry for not sufficient knowledge on technical domains and the Reddit platform. This is my first post on it.\n\nMy interest includes robotics algorithms (mapping, localization, motion planning, and so on), computer vision, machine learning, low-level programming, autonomous driving systems. I would like to work in the robotics industry as a software engineer or research engineer. To get job opportunities in these competitive areas, I plan to get a Master's degree or Ph.D. in a related area. I recently have got an internship (almost equals to a part-time job) as a computer vision engineer, which attracts me so much. So, I am eager to get deeper into these areas.\n\nBecause of my broad interest and probably vague understanding of these domains, however, I have trouble with deciding whether I will major in Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science.\n\nThe same kinds of questions are already posted, but courses of CS and ME are a little bit different from ones in general. For your better understanding of my situation, I give a brief explanation about departments in my university.\n\nThe department of Mechanical Engineering in the university where I learn provides so many courses about mechanics (heat, fluid, material, mechanisms), control (classical & modern), and mechanical designs based on CAD, but not enough ones about robotics software, especially about the algorithm area. In lab classes, they deal with more heat systems like engines, less intelligent robots, deep learning, or software (not zero).\n\nThe department of Computer Science provides a deep understanding of computer systems, algorithms, low-level programming, machine learning, compiler, and logic. Especially, since I like low-level programming and computer system, these kinds of classes strongly attract me. However, they learn nothing about engineering concepts such as control, signal processing, and robotics algorithms. In addition, they learn mathematics from so theoretical point of view, which does not seem to fit me. I like math, especially optimization and geometry, but classes like \"definition -> proof -> definition -> proof -> ...\" are boring for me. Historically, CS in my university derived from Math and belongs to the School of Science, not to the School of Engineering, so it is natural that professors studying pure discrete mathematics and pure logic in CS. In my view, though a CS degree is said to be good for jobs related to software, it is not necessarily true for robotics software.\n\nIn summary, it is a problem like \"Hardware side with so much mechanics and design or Software side with computer systems and a little bit too theoretical mathematics\".\n\nI hope to get some advice from those who are related to the robotics industry or academia.\n\nThanks for reading and answering, in advance.","created_utc":1620416902,"name":"t3_n777tm","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n777tm\/career_which_is_better_mechanical_engineering_or\/","author_link_karma":1,"author_comment_karma":0,"score":1,"author_created_utc":1619778516,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"Maronoon_555"},{"id":"n772e7","author_name":"alisyed539","title":"I am 2 years into college at an Engineering School","body":"I am 2 years into my Computer Engineering major at my college.

It was one of those Kool-Aid drinking places where everyone is \"family\" and all that nonsense. During that time I had a bunch of managers, but my last one hated me from the get-go for some reason and my life a living hell. Right before the pandemic he called me all sorts of names, I went to his skip level, huge mess. I was ready to get out, and then the pandemic hit and suddenly jobs were hard to come by.\n\nThen with the pandemic the company laid off 1\/2 of their staff and it ruined what was left of the culture. Nobody trusted each other, everyone talked shit behind everyone's back, micromanagement, people constantly getting yelled at, coworkers that were friends turning on each other. It basically got to the point where I opened my laptop and wondered \"how am I going to get yelled at today?\"\n\nLong story short, I left that nightmare and started a new remote job. People from my old job are stalking my LinkedIn. I even had someone who still works there who I once considered a friend email me, tell me my boss talked shit on me for over 2 years in 1 on 1's (and still does), and that I was replaced by my boss's friend. I don't need old gossip in my life (and not sure what the point is to even rub my nose in this shit), so needless to say we don't speak anymore.\n\nSo long story short, after years of emotional abuse in the workplace I am having a bit of a hard time trusting my new coworkers. I keep waiting for my new boss to jump down my throat, or my coworkers to gossip about me, even though there's no inclination that either will happen. After years of passive aggressive code reviews, I'm trying not to project that tone on new people, but I can't help it. \n\nOther than good old therapy, do you have any work-place related tips on how to mentally \"start fresh\" with a new group of people?

I have agreed via email to take a new job and have been sent the final contract to sign. I was sent the final contract yesterday. I have not signed it.\n\nNow, for a lot of background: Last September I was in the interview process with this same company. It is quite a big company, probably top 5 in my country (Asian). I initially reached out to them to apply. I got the offer, however, I turned them down because the salary increase wasn't really that much for jumping jobs, about a 20% increase. I do like my current job (100% WFH, this new one is not) so it wasn't worth it.\n\nSoon after I turned them down, my project at my current job ended due to unforeseen reasons. So in December I reached out to them and asked if the role was still available, they said no, but they will let me know next spring if\/when they have openings. So they did. I got an email in March. By  this time I still didn't actually have a project at work, basically having done nothing for 5 months. So I said yes. I tried to negotiate a few things with them but they would not budge on anything--no extra vacation days, not a single extra dollar in salary. Nothing. But whatever, I really wanted this job. I went through 1 more in-person interview with them. They did wonder why I was interested in the job again since I initially turned them down and I just told them the truth.\n\nThings took some time, and I finally agreed to the official offer letter in mid April. \\*\\*2 big differences\\*\\* comparing this offer and the one from last year--this is a 2 year contract offer, and last year's was permanent employment. This one also gives me a 28% raise compared to 20% last time. I wasn't thrilled about just a 2 yr contract, but well whatever.\n\n Then holy shit, literally the day I was set to tell my current job that I will be leaving at the end of May--I got a raise. Out of nowhere. I never asked for it or hinted to anyone. A 25% raise. When I got the initial email from my director, I thought I was getting fired. Now the 2 salaries are nearly identical--just a 3% difference between them. I did not tell the new job though, because I didn't want them to feel like I was stringing them along, especially since I turned down their offer last year. Then \\*after\\* that, \\*I\\* reached back out to them. So I said to myself, \"ok fine. You really have to just accept this. Very bad timing, but that's life. Stay true to your word, you accepted so it's the right thing to do.\" So I told my current job I will be resigning at the end of May, and I refused their raise. Now our 2 companies HRs are talking to get all visa stuff worked out for visa transfer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo then yesterday I finally got the final contract. And there are some things that are different, or were not included in the initial offer. For example, there is no mention of my bonus. Also the contract states that employees are not allowed to discuss salaries with anyone besides management. And it says something I (unfortunately) overlooked initially--the company can, at their sole discretion, extend the probation period indefinitely. It also states (not included in original contract) that in the event of termination, they can give me payment in lieu of advance notice. This is pretty bad for me because I am an international employee, so if I get fired my visa expires and I have 1 week maximum to pack all my stuff and leave the country--a country where I have mostly built my life the last 5 years.\n\nSo honestly at this point I just feel like this company is extremely stiff and rigid. In our first round of salary negotiations last year, they refused to budge at all. Then again during March they also refused to grant me a single thing I requested--they just said \"XYZ is standard for our international employees, we can't change it.\" It really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. And now, finally I get the final contract and my bonus is written out. I requested that they remove  their ability to extend the probation period, and they once again said they cannot remove that language, it is standard in all contracts.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from just refusing to sign is I want to keep my reputation. I feel like going back on them a 2nd time will destroy my local reputation and recruiters that they or others may know will think badly of me, and news will get around. Other than that, honestly, a 3% salary raise is not at all worth all this hassle. \n\nShould I try to stay at my current job (I am about 90% sure they would let me stay), or just suck up the missteps I've already made? Thanks for reading until the end.","created_utc":1620390754,"name":"t3_n6xev9","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n6xev9\/really_need_advice_on_whether_or_not_to_change\/","author_link_karma":1,"author_comment_karma":1,"score":1,"author_created_utc":1611931885,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"throwaway5ifbgesdf"},{"id":"n6xats","author_name":"TrainingPermission35","title":"When can you quit without a job lined up?","body":"For reference, I'm a 2020 Ivy CS grad that started working in August.\n\nI know everyone says to try to stick it out at work until you have a job lined up but honestly it's really hard when you work at a super [toxic work place](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/mzfgnw\/is_this_a_normal_work_environment\/).

Just for context, I'm a man and come from an ethnic minority, outside the US.\n\nI started programming shortly after College around 7 years ago, doing Java during my first job. Projects were boring all the time (desktop apps), and I was interested in doing web dev, so I decided to apply to a Frontend position and got hired in 2015 in a digital agency, where I've had the chance to work on a variety of projects using several of the most popular JS frameworks. It was there where I really learned the software development cycle, versioning, testing, among other stuff.\n\nThe first two years I used to engage in long learning curves whenever I started a new project (we do mostly outsourced maintenance of existing projects). I would spend hours reading documentation, testing, googling, and debugging during ramp-up phases. And I kinda hoped this curve would get shorter with time as I got more experienced. But the truth is that it never did.\n\nBecause of how diverse and complex FE projects can be technology-wise, every time that I have to switch to a new team or project, I feel like I am starting from scratch. Like day 1. There can be a new framework with hundreds of new dependencies that I've never seen in my life or a strange integration of js libraries that somehow somebody managed to put together to build a set of web forms that could've been easily implemented in a different approach.\n\nAnd it's so frustrating because I have to be asking tons of questions all the time, onboarding sessions are never enough and mentorship is nonexistent most of the time. I get stuck easily and it takes me forever to catch up. At a personal level, it makes me feel constantly incompetent and forever inexperienced until eventually, I manage to fully understand everything.\n\nI know code maintenance can be hell. And I know every project and every company is different. But in my case, I haven't had the luck to grow as much as I wanted during these years as a FE developer. Maybe maintenance doesn't make you grow as much. Maybe FE is actually a huge mess. Or maybe I have the wrong impression of how experience translates into learning curve times. But the truth is that it can be very overwhelming.\n\nHas anybody here gone through something similar?\n\nAny tips to speed up learning curves?\n\nThank you","created_utc":1620359719,"name":"t3_n6pq2c","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n6pq2c\/learning_curves_and_onboarding_frustrations_seem\/","author_link_karma":7,"author_comment_karma":1,"score":12,"author_created_utc":1601664137,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"legendary_child"},{"id":"n6pbir","author_name":"paopu_boy","title":"Got my dream job and I feel incredibly underqualified","body":"**TLDR:** I feel dumber than all my coworkers at my first job even though they've got years of experience and it's making me feel horrible mentally. \n\nI've been at my first developer job for about two months now as an iOS engineer.

Got stuck doing shitty work and not learning. Working with senior dev who drives good engineers away and management has no intention to address it. Should I quit and focus on my mental health and interviewing? Or will that hurt my second job hunt a lot \ud83e\udd14 \n\nHi all. I\u2019ve been in my first engineering job for about 10 months and I\u2019ve been seriously contemplating quitting for about a month. It started off as a good experience because I had a great senior engineer mentor on my team but once she left I realized that she shielded me from working with the senior developer who everyone dislikes. She left during a reorg where both my supportive manager and coworkers that I like got moved to a different team and I was left working with people who are all doing their own things. The senior developer is the only one I get to work with and his code is bad, the whole team depends on him, and I got stuck doing shit work for months (moving an app to production) so I basically just spend all day trying to get his code to run on my computer and he\u2019s constantly changing it so I have to constantly meet with him. All of the code stuff I\u2019m doing is shitty configuration stuff and it\u2019s never ending. I\u2019m not learning or building and everyday I have to say \u201cstill working on the same thing\u201d in scrum. The senior dev is not friendly, very condescending, mansplained the terminal to me, and basically just does what he wants since he\u2019s been here forever. Adding on to all of that, I started my first job during the pandemic and throughout everything that\u2019s been going on with BLM, Stop asian hate, etc. no one on my team talks about what\u2019s going on. Add on to that that I\u2019m the only woman of color on a team of 20 men and I\u2019ve started hating and resenting my job to the point where I have crying breakdowns everyday. I\u2019ve also expressed my frustrations to my manager months ago and asked to get put on a different project but nothing has happened. I hate the company culture and a bunch of people have left my team as well. I\u2019ve given up on pushing for change here and I\u2019ve started job hunting. I\u2019m trying to hold out longer but part of me is wondering if I should just quit and focus on my mental health and interviewing. I have about 3-4 months of savings saved up as well. I\u2019m mostly concerned about losing negotiating power or having to job hunt\/explain my situation in interviews. I\u2019m also concerned about not having my first job tenure be a whole year & the idea of potentially not finding a job for months. Any thoughts?

I don't think I'll ever enjoy managing people just to manage, but I do enjoy being a team leader and staying technical. Over the past 2 years I've been shadowing local dentists (9 month gap during pandemic) and really enjoyed it. I'm thinking of using my savings to fund my way through dental school, as the older dentists I shadowed had extreme work life balance, high salary, and job stability. They all typical work 32 hours over 4 days, no call, rare emergency overtime, and seem to get more desirable with age.\n\nThe cs folks I work with over 40 tend to take 2 paths. The lucky successful ones (10% of people or less) get m7 mbas and move into the upper echelons, making great money with terrible hours. The remaining 90% of people on my path tend to settle into middle management, face lay offs, lack autonomy, face wage stagnation, and generally seem unhappy.\n\nI applied to a competitive pre dental program with over 90% acceptance rate to dental schools but I'm getting cold feet as everyone I know is telling me it's not worth it (5 years long, 300k tuition plus lost wage). I'm also worried in the future dentistry will go cities l corporate and I'll be a slave to production.\n\nAm I wrong in thinking ageism will hurt me in my current career without a masters degree?

I can make tech packs and spec sheets, 3D model a dress, draft patterns and textile prints, cut and sew a garment and photograph to sell.. but how do these skills transfer to something like software development? \n\n4.

Stick it out for a year?","body":"Hey everyone. I'm a (formerly) lead developer based in the Rust Belt. Have about 12 years experience, skill wise I have had my hands all over the place. My last company went belly up due to the pandemic and earlier this year I started interviewing.\n\nWith remote jobs popping off, a whole new world was opened up for me with job opportunities. I got 5 offers since January. Some gave me close or near my low Rust Belt salary, or the benefits weren't great so I turned them down. Then I got an offer from a mid sized West Coast company (remote).\n\nThe job was for a mid level developer role and their salary was amazing for me, so I took it. But then I took the job and found out that the job itself is way beneath me skills wise.... and I haven't even wrote a single line of code in the 2 months I've been there. So here are my pros and cons:\n\nCons:\n\n- Haven't wrote any code, worried I will stagnate skills wise over time.\n\n- They mislead me, so not exactly hyped about that\n\n- Company is going through a transitionary period, a good number of people have left and been backfilled\n\nPros:\n\n- Pay is WAY more than I can get locally. For reference my friend works in my city as a senior dev and gets $40k less than I do for a tough dev job, while I tweak XML files and other easy stuff. Pay is also more than I got with other remote offers\n\n- Great benefits (unlimited PTO with 20 days minimum encouraged, employee perks, don't have to commute)\n\n- I like my coworkers and they like me\n\n- Low stress. No micromanagement, no one cares what schedule you work, job is a breeze, no panic attacks come deadline time. And best of all, NO DAILY STANDUPS OR SCRUM SHIT!!!\n\nSo I am thinking about just sticking it out for a year. After all the mental stress put on by the pandemic, I feel like I could use a year to work a low stress job and remove myself from the rat race, at least for awhile. However, I am worried that I will stagnate and not interview well in a year. I have no problem getting offers now, and I figure that down the line I can work on my Github and stuff again and get back up to speed.\n\nWhat do you think? Is it worth the risk this far into my career?","created_utc":1620326736,"name":"t3_n6efnz","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n6efnz\/unknowingly_took_a_job_that_will_stagnate_my\/","author_link_karma":84,"author_comment_karma":44,"score":59,"author_created_utc":1613154863,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"Worldly_Pineapple_80"},{"id":"n6dtsu","author_name":"Emperor-Valtorei","title":"Java Skills to Focus On","body":"Hello, everyone!\n\nSo I'm currently a student in my junior year, albeit a bit behind everyone else.\n\nI have been working the past few years on projects and other languages, mainly JavaScript and some C#.

I have zero experience in the entire field, I have zero experience in tech in general.  I used to be a chef for a living. I was hired after I finished a coding bootcamp. \n\nThis is my first tech job and the company is aware of this. I have had 6 1on1s with my boss but I feel like I'm not asking the appropriate questions. He hasn't mentioned anything about it but I feel like I'm going to be expected to ask the job related questions now but I fear I still don't really know what it is I'm supposed to be doing. I was told to learn the test automation and be able to do the automation for when we do production release and I've attempted it but I always end up making the test fail and communication with the people in charge of this hasn't really been available and to boot, i think one of the two is on vacation or sick leave at the moment. I'm expected to do a run next Friday.\n\nI've been tasked to learn and I update on my learning. I went to a bootcamp and learned the MERN stack but this company deals with their own proprietary stack so every time I try to learn something I just say .. \"well I learned this and I can see the similarity of this with what is being used in our codebase\" and it seems to be a reasonable explanation to my inability to understand the code thoroughly but I don't know how much longer I can explain that way. \n\nI feel like there's  not much mentorship but I don't know if a month and a half is what they expect to be enough to start on asking more work specific questions and not finding similarities on what I was learning and the codebase that exists already.\n\nSo to my question, what sort of questions can I ask my manager to communicate that I want to be able to understand the codebase but I need some more guidance than what I am receiving now? Basically like 1 to 2 people talking to me a per week and tell me to update my access requests and they will connect with me again later when that's done. When I do get pass that they are busy and can't talk to me again and I'm just left to watching pluralsight videos all day. I'm not complaining, I just feel like I'm still not really learning what I need to learn specifically related to the job and that they will think I will not be good enough for this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the rant.

What I realized is that regardless of funding, it does not stop them from having the most unpredictable hiring practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne startup promised me they would consider me for fully remote and that location is not issue for them.  Well, the boomer cofounders decided that they will not be a WFH company, and that they want people in the office at least 4 days a week in the Bay Area.  I decided no thanks, and withdrew my application.\n\n\n\n\n\n6 months ago, I applied for a backend engineering position at one startup.  The recruiter interview went well, then started talking with the hiring manager.  He literally told me that he has zero intention of hiring me for the role in the first minute of the interview, and asked me if I would be willing to interview with them a few months into the future when data-related roles open up.  6 months later, the only job postings this company has is a few account manager jobs.\n\n\n\n\nAnother startup had a lengthy technical interview process.  I did great, but they rejected me because of \"lack of fit\".  Whatever that means, but I typically do well with other companies that have more behavioral interviews.\n\n\n\nWith these hiring practices, it seems like startups will never be able to compete with bigger companies in terms of hiring talent.

I personally would take a very small paycut at my next job if this was possible and if I could work on interesting projects.\n\n\n\n\nStartups with old-fashioned views of WFH will never attract quality engineers if they can't offer WFH to their engineers when they are paying below market value.\n\n\n\n\n\nStartups have the opportunity to attract a lot of talent, but their hiring practices prevent it.","created_utc":1620315685,"name":"t3_n6a6v9","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n6a6v9\/why_is_startup_hiring_so_dysfunctional\/","author_link_karma":5,"author_comment_karma":0,"score":2,"author_created_utc":1617982600,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"man_spider5"},{"id":"n69tkl","author_name":"timisgame","title":"I want to get a work from home job, I been doing it since March of last year in my current position.","body":"My title is System Administrator, but do little Sys admin stuff, some powershell, some AD stuff, made my own inventory website and some batch files.

Currently going for my bachelors. I have been a machinist for 5 years, minus 6 months where I was a tooling engineer before being demoted due to the pandemic. Shortly after I followed a coworker to a different company as it was made clear that my engineering position was being eliminated even after business picked up.\n\nI recently was reached out to by a friend who's small shop was looking for another manufacturing engineer. The place offered me the position with no raise (I am paid very well for a machinist, I produce excellent results), and the benefits are not as good seeing as it is a much smaller shop then the one I work at. However, the way I see it is that engineering experience will help my engineering career in the long run compared to more machining experience. (It's not really a field that can be peaked, but I feel like anything else I learn would only be useful if I stayed being a machinist).\n\nSo with that job offer in hand, I gave my notice at my current job. Immediately upon doing so I was told to talk to the plant manager and explain the situation. I did so, while explaining that the company had treated me excellently, and that I was not leaving due to an increase in pay but rather more suitable work experience.\n\nI was made a counter offer which will be given to me in writing on monday that states something to the following effect: I will become an associate manufacturing engineer, the company will reimburse the next 2 years of my tuition and upon completion I will be promoted to manufacturing engineer. However the duties of associate manufacturing engineer will not start for a few months while they free someone up to operate my machines.\n\nIn the machining\/manufacturing world, it's completely normal for things to take a bit because skilled labor is hard to come by (especially now, given the current job market). I also did not find any reason to doubt the legitimacy of his want for me to fill this position. There is a lifetime employee\/engineer retiring in a year or 2, and the other engineers have purchased tooling that has made me want to bang my head into a wall, causing real issues in the shop. I was a tooling engineer at one point, so there have been times I have told them things weren't going to work before even producing parts. (so far, I've won that argument every time after they try it anyways.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my question with that all out of the way is: should I consider the counter offer? I have always heard they are bad to accept. However I do enjoy my current company, I just want to start my engineering career and start to leave my machining one behind. If I were to accept the counter offer, what sorts of things should I look for in the written offer to be safe?","created_utc":1620258267,"name":"t3_n5u10s","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n5u10s\/counter_offer_advice\/","author_link_karma":1,"author_comment_karma":0,"score":2,"author_created_utc":1602359428,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"Dense_Grapefruit1459"},{"id":"n5tfwx","author_name":"torrentialsnow","title":"Is learning C# and Unity a good start?","body":"Honestly speaking, I've had multiple mental breakdowns over this past week.

I was a junior last year doing well having had done 10+ APs for some credit, national merit finalist in hs etc so generally good student and was doing well but then covid struck and we all got kicked out of housing (avoiding personal info) I went without access to internet and was forced to move into an environment I avoided for years. I became incredibly depressed and basically couldn't be bothered to finish my classes even though I basically just had to open and take the final ( I was so miserable and shameful of myself I thought I deserved to fail even if I could pass). I failed 3 classes just from avoidance and got withdrawn from the university and on top of that I went through a breakup and that was the cherry on top.\n\nI appealed late in the summer when I felt a bit better and I thought I couldn't tell anyone that that happened and they luckily let me back in. I miraculously went back and my financial aid was miraculously given back as well at the sympathy of a counselor. I started to feel better around the fall, and somehow luckily I got a job around December at a very reputable company for xx engineering with a great program. The thing is the mental health issues left me barely scraping by as I wasn't properly able to be productive and got basically all D's in all my classes which was fine for graduating I suppose, but I'm nearing the end of spring semester and the classes I have exams for I could cram and take, but my very very last cs class in circuitry was asynchronous and I basically didn't even look at it doing half the assignments, missed all quizzes and lab attendance grade, and the final is in a week. I'm confident in my ability to do well on the final tbh, but even then it looks like I won't be able to pass the class.\n\nMy job is set to start in mid June, and I don't think I'll ever be lucky enough to receive an offer as amazing as this job in the current job climate and in general. It's basically 100k salary w amazing benefits and opportunities at a top 50 company. I can't take this class in the summer as it's not offered either. I emailed the professor recently and he said he's a little sympathetic but unless I get a doctor's note for some assignments, he is being strict with all his deadlines and giving 0's a minute late grading policy. I really don't know what to do and I've heard of people taking jobs and not saying anything which tbh seems possible in this case, but I also am afraid of the risks of that backfiring and sorta disappointed having done the work for 2 majors and not getting a degree. I really haven't told anyone about this as my peers are so happy for me, but graduation is in a few weeks (luckily optional so I don't have to tell family) and it's eating at me inside. Only in the last few weeks I've started to get my shit together from the support of a few incredible supportive people to recover my other classes but this one class seems unsalvageable.\n\nWhat should I even do? My friends family and relatives are all expecting me to graduate with this job. Should I just start the job and not look back? Or do I tell my company, lose the opportunity, and take another semester in the fall to graduate (if my university even lets me attend again after failing so many classes). It's so stupid that I did this to myself especially when looking back all I had to do was the bare minimum, but I also can't forget how debilitating the shame and depression that I went through lead me here.

My problem mainly stems from the fact that I feel that I don't really have the skills that most companies are looking for due to some off-kilter experience.\n\nAs for why that is: I actually did a dual degree in Computer Science and Engineering Physics (EP first, then started CS in 3rd year). This was partially because EP has few job prospects unless you're going into research or are gung-ho about space (which I am not), and partially because I wanted to get an internship through the CS department's internship program (which worked out, thankfully). Throughout these degrees, my accumulated experience amounts to 3 summers of research writing data analysis code for radar and satellite data (with 2 papers published with co-author credits) and a 16-month internship writing image analysis code for a university group that was half research group and half startup company (its weird). As for projects, I was focused on my classes, so my projects mainly stem from them: a Python simulator to recreate the results of a networking paper, a mechanical device for rotating tiny samples in a vacuum chamber (for the EP degree's final-year project), and other small things that recruiters likely wouldn't care about like a dead-simple stepper motor driver.\n\nAs a result, I don't seem to mesh well with most entry-level software development positions. I don't have any web-dev experience, whether front, back, or full-stack (despite the image analysis code being made for a web-app; I just didn't write much non-analysis stuff for the backend codebase, which was mostly Python, Django, and an abuse of ElasticSearch as a database). Embedded and IOT stuff seem interesting to me, but they seem to require hardcore C\/C++ experience that I don't have plus a bunch of other weird skills that I've not have encountered before. Cloud and database stuff is also interesting, but they similarly have high requirements that I can't really meet. It seems that all I could really do is data analysis, but I'd much rather be a software developer and not be pigeonholed into just analysis, even with substantial coding involved.\n\nAnd so, I haven't applied to as many places as I should have so far. I've gotten 1 interview, but only because a friend of a friend (\/my supervisor for my internship) gave me a referral to a popular local company with Master's level AI people also applying to it. I just don't know what positions I qualify for or should apply to. I don't know how I can convince recruiters and companies that I could easily learn and do embedded, or cloud, or web development with what is largely analysis experience. I don't know how I can spin my mish-mash of experience into a full-time software development position.\n\n(And, for posterity, [my current resume](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/TSLvJWt), though critiques are not the point of this post compared to the worries I mentioned above.)","created_utc":1620241641,"name":"t3_n5nu1o","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n5nu1o\/what_entrylevel_jobs_do_i_even_qualify_for_with\/","author_link_karma":1,"author_comment_karma":309,"score":3,"author_created_utc":1430100466,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"HoboDesert"},{"id":"n5ns19","author_name":"impossiblyirrelevant","title":"How can I re-enter the industry a year after graduation?","body":"I graduated last July and ended up taking a sales\/logistics job because it was all I could find in the timeframe in which I needed to start working.

These are open source tools for deep learning. I don't know if experience alone can fix this under the hood problem.\n\nI also did not understand the material perfectly well in theory classes back in college. I believe a formal training will sharpen my skills in reading ML papers and implement them to code. Plus, I got rejected from a machine learning research scientist position I applied because someone with an MS degree was preferred by the company. \n\nOther than that realization in my limitation of understanding, I don't know other possible motivations to get an MS in CS with ML focus degree. Hoping you could give my some guidance. Thank you. \n\n\n\nP. S\nI'm from a third world country where AI\/ML is not yet booming.","created_utc":1620239551,"name":"t3_n5n0l3","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n5n0l3\/is_a_masters_in_cs_with_focus_on_ml_worth_it\/","author_link_karma":162,"author_comment_karma":70,"score":3,"author_created_utc":1493176898,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"leggo_mango"},{"id":"n5my38","author_name":"UnderstandingBusy758","title":"EZ job or double salary in hell","body":"I have an EZ job making 6 figures but I was offered double to work for a big tech comapny.

I'm going to be an undergrad junior in the fall, but I can't take upper levels til next winter because I only started CS coursework last Fall (premed freshman year). I have an internship with cybersecurity at a non-tech company (with a tech internship program)  this summer, but I got to final interview with a FAANG company earlier this year (but bombed it because I got a question on binary trees, at which point I hadn't even learned about pointers or linked lists). After that rejection, I kept looking for other positions but didn't hear back at all (so maybe the FAANG interview process was a fluke). Outside of classwork and a computational bio internship, I don't have any experience with software dev, and I have no clue what Dev\/Ops or Full Stack or Front\/Back end even means (though I think I could just google that lol). I just feel like a tiny fish in a huge pond.\n\nI know C++ a good amount (that's what my classes are taught in) and at my current job I use Python. I learned Java in high school and I can use R for statistical programming. What additional skills should I develop? Are there are any project ideas that I could take on over the summer (couple hours on weekends\/after work)  that will make my resume stand out and my portfolio less barren? I want the internship search to be different next summer, and I want to go in feeling confident that I'll breeze past the initial resume reviews.

Are my feelings valid or am I just being too sensitive?","body":"I have nowhere else to rant so I wanted to post here to get people's opinion. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this way knowing how lucky I am to have a job and a company that has treated me well but oh well.  Over the past 2-3 months, I've started to feel very upset and angry at my work due to small little things adding up to a point I can't just ignore and I want to share with everyone to see if anyone else has experienced these. I feel like I'm being a soft azz beach but I just can't tell why it upsets me so much.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. In our team calls where we are discussing new features and details, I feel like I don't get the chance to say what I want to say. One senior starts talking about something, UX jumps in to point flaws and then it just becomes a back and forth back and forth between these two with others jumping in and cutting each other off to speak and I'm just not like that. Ill politely raise my hand and wait until my manager calls but because these guys keep going back and forth and my manager doesn't shut them up, it gets to the end of the meeting and I either forgot what I wanted to say or no more time and the meeting ends with my opinions and thoughts not expressed. Like there have been times I wanna unmute and just yell \"CAN EVERYONE PLEASE SHUT UP AND LET ME SPEAK!\" but that's obviously unprofessional and I hate cutting people off mid conversation to assert my point. It happened several times and I just feel like nobody gives a shit about what I need to say. The seniors dominate the conversation and UX guy can't just shut the up for a God damn second and keeps pushing back while I sit there politely waiting for my turn. At the beginning I just ignored it and said it's fine but it happened so much that now I just feel like crying and feel useless to the company cause nobody apparently cares about what I want to say. The couple times I have had the chance to express my views regardless how dumb they are, I appreciated just being acknowledged and being told that it's not a good idea or it's a great idea. I'm not always right but I literally just want to be acknowledged and heard when I have something.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. One time some guy from another team was having trouble with something he was working on and it was connected to something I worked on before. I help him troubleshoot and spend my entire day looking beyond our code and into the packages we are using (went beyond our codebase, a deeper rooted issue). Once I found out why, I was excited since it took me the whole damn day. He's much more senior than I am so I was really excited to report to him the problem. Once I did, he was just like \"oh that's wrong it shouldn't be like that\" end of conversation. No thank you, no appreciation for debugging for him, no F'ING NOTHING! I was so deflated cause I literally could have denied to help him but because he's much more senior and has way more experience, I felt rude rejecting his request although I had my own work.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n 3. Manager assigned me a feature that I should work on. I was super excited and he helped give me get started. I start digging into it, researching it, spending my personal time outside work cause I was just that invested. Mid way through, he tells me he will look into it too. He ends up hijacking it and finishing it using some of the work I had done ... Again I felt upset. Why do all that when you were gonna end up working and finishing it. Wtf??? Was I taking too long? Could you have not just directed me to get it done the way you wanted?   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways these are some examples that come to mind and I've gotten to a point where I just drag myself to work. I can't tell if it's valid to feel upset and hurt cause the company has been otherwise treating me well and my manager most of the times is cool and understanding but I can't help understand why I'm so frustrated and upset when I do work. Everyone else in the company seems to be at harmony. Nobody else seems to have trouble with one another. Why do I feel the outlier? Why do I feel so upset and angry at people? I'm so confused .... I cannot reason my emotions. I shouldn't feel this way I have work at a time many people don't and I'm getting paid well but why am I so upset and frustrated with people??","created_utc":1620236423,"name":"t3_n5lrfx","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n5lrfx\/rant_feeling_upset_and_angry_are_my_feelings\/","author_link_karma":1,"author_comment_karma":0,"score":0,"author_created_utc":1620236342,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"Accomplished_Cell890"},{"id":"n5l6de","author_name":"Fuzzy_Assistance_940","title":"Statistically How Am I Doing?

It's not FAANG-level compensation (\\~175K total comp, 10 YOE), but it's still pretty good IMO.  Ideally, I'll jump to a FAANG at some point in the future.  \n\nAny suggestions?   \n\n\nI'm conflicted because 6 months this year is guaranteed while option 2 does not necessarily guarantee severance.  I know this coming year the job market will be redhot as well, so this may be the time to make the jump to a FAANG","created_utc":1620226152,"name":"t3_n5hoiu","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n5hoiu\/take_6_month_severance_this_year_or\/","author_link_karma":26,"author_comment_karma":2,"score":1,"author_created_utc":1588598650,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"DataDev88"},{"id":"n5hbhi","author_name":"Ok-Use","title":"When applying for a job in tech, do you match with the all the responsibilities described in JD?","body":" \n\nHi, sometimes I know few things well, beginner in few things and don't know few things.\n\nIs it necessary to match 100% responsibilities described in JD?\n\nI  have seen some companies which have ridiculously high expectations with  a gigantic set of responsibilities for the experience they are looking  for.\n\nAnother way to look at this is, if someone knows everything then there would be very little scope to grow.\n\nHow's been your experience with this?

Initially I thought about getting another 1099 job because I have the bandwidth for it but then I feel like maybe I'm stretching myself too thin and going in the wrong direction. So another thought I had was to go on these sites that offer developers for hire and vet them myself and then turn around and apply for jobs that allow third party applicants. The developer would then be handed over as a consultant to work on the project for the client. There would be no project management on my side. They would simply be a supplemental resource added to a client project. I would build a higher hourly rate and take a cut off the top of it.\n\nWhat am I missing here? This sounds kind of easy especially since I can talk the lingo of tech because I am a developer. It feels like this would scale better than continuing to do 1099 work myself.

This is my first job, gonna complete an year next month, right out of university - I did my internship here too. I'm working in a split model, where I offer technical support, and handle tickets for the better part of three days, and then I develop tools to support this team in the remaining two. Most of my active development deals with AngularJS and Java 8\/Spring.\n\nI wasn't interested in the support part at all, but I decided to continue with the job because I was afraid of the job market during the pandemic. I have continued to dislike it, but I have learnt how to better manage my time due to it. I also decided to think of it as the \"[eating my own dog food](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eating_your_own_dog_food)\".\n\nLately, I've gotten extremely frustrated because of the kind of code I'm exposed to. This team completely makes internal products, so we have next to no \"good code\". I have worked with better code than this in my second year of university. It ranges from ridiculous architectural designs, to unit tests that are written purely for the sake of it (think mocks an input and verifies that the input is mocked), and just zero handling of technical debt whatsoever.\n\nI have toyed with the idea of shifting to a different team that does work on consumer-facing products, considering I love the firm I'm at but that seems to be unlikely because our support team is currently in the middle of a resource crunch. What do I do now? Should I consider a new job? Has anyone else been in the same position here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'm also helping out interns who joined us this year. A common thing I've heard from the seniors is that \"its fine if they can't code well, its the easiest part of the job\".

Next Comes Vetting. Some questions","body":"Here's the short version of where I am in a hiring process. Skip to the tldr for the relevant question in bold:\n\nApplied for a job I wasn't qualified for (by accident), surprisingly, they still wanted to interview me. \n\nI did well in the first interview, was asked to do a second one with the team I'd be working with. That also went well. \n\nHad a 15 minute zoom call with the hiring manager (from the first interview), he wants to hire me, but (as described above) I'm not qualified for the position I applied for, but he wants to hire me for a position that's being created currently (already submitted to hr, they're doing approval before its posted). Told me it SHOULD take 1-2 weeks, but knowing hr, make that a month. \n\nHe told me I might consider doing a temp position in the mean time, but only if Hr could guarantee a smooth transition to the full time position. After about a week, hr could not give him the assurances he wanted, so he took the temp thing off the table and said we'd wait for the full time position.\n\nGot an update friday, they're negotiating the salary with hr now. Got another update this morning: position passed the first step of the approval process, he expects the job to (hopefully) \"post\" this week. He'll then move my application to that newly created position where he'll then tell hr he wants to hire me for that position. \n\n**I then asked what step comes next. He said hr will do their vetting of me, then they'll formally extend me the offer. He said the vetting will be normal stuff like checking references and my education. I have the bachelor's degree in computer science that is required for this entry level position, but I'm worried about my gpa. While i didn't see anything about gpa requirements, my college gpa was pretty shit (under a 3.0) because I switched majors yata yata yata. I've heard from a friend who's a software engineer at an insurance company, that she's had people get hired by the hiring manager, and then upon hr reviewing their application, denied the hire because of their gpa. I don't know how typical that is though. Couple questions then. First, how common is it for people to check your gpa (rather than just verify that you do in fact possess the required degree). Of the 4-5 places i've gotten interviews with the last year (fuck covid man, so many places are in a hiring freeze, if not outright laying people off), only one has requested my transcripts. Obviously I didn't get that job. And my second question, how common is it for places to then reject you if your gpa isn't above a certain threshold? I mean its not like its beneath a 2.0 or anything. its just not above 3.0. If i were to just give them my gpa for the last 2.5 years (5 semester) when i formally switched majors to computer science, my gpa is a 3.06. I think that's a lot more relevant to my skills than to look at my long gpa history when I was in a completely unrelated major.**\n\ndon't sugar coat it for me. This is the first time since i graduated last may that a company was actually interested in hiring me. Its a large university hiring for biomedical research they do. I'd hate to finally have a tentative offer only to have hr give the thumbs down. If my hiring manager (whom i've built a rapport with) is emphatic enough, could he sway them? \n\nThanks as always guys","created_utc":1620190383,"name":"t3_n57on7","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n57on7\/tentatively_offered_a_job_next_comes_vetting_some\/","author_link_karma":15884,"author_comment_karma":13941,"score":5,"author_created_utc":1502931390,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":1,"author":"Dotaproffessional"},{"id":"n56vae","author_name":"BeneficialPage8","title":"Job Advice","body":"Looking for a new job with a newly accredited AWS certification.

I also have a lot of AI experience through clubs using Python but I am not really a big fan of working with ML\/AI, still worth mentioning since I believe Django has a decent market share for backend.\n\nI am trying to make myself as attractive a candidate as possible through bolstering my personal portfolio.

For my second coop work term (Jan 2019), I only had 4 months of work experience, did like 50 applications, got 7-8 interviews and multiple offers. Now with that coop work term experience, I did almost 500 applications, over 10-12 interviews and no offer so far. I have done a lot of mock interviews, did 130 leetcode problems, had referrals, and had really good interviews but it seems like it is almost impossible to get an internship now. My friends who work at FAANG and with whom I practiced Mock, told me that the best way to approach a problem is to give them a suboptimal solution, then work with your interviewer to give an optimal solution, and even if you can't, if you share your thought process, they will take you in (one of my friend couldn't solve a faang problem but talked out his thought process and got the job at that same company). Seems like it is no longer the case. Interviewers want an optimal solution at the first try, and if I work with them, I just get rejected. I recently had an interview with SAP where they gave me 2 problems, i gave them optimal for the one and suboptimal for the second one and my interviewer told me I did really well, and I was really good at communicating my thought process, yet I got rejected.\n\nI really am feeling extremely burnt out and tired. if this is the norm, how can I even break into the industry? My high gpa that I worked really hard for, my interview prep that I spent hours after hours with my friends, spending time on my resume, countless mock interviews with coop office, paid service and with my friends, all are just going to waste. I am not only tired and concerned that maybe I should not be in the field in the first place. My other engineering friends even in this job market didn't have to go through that many interviews, and some coop programs (especially civil, mining and geotechnical) have almost 100% placement rate (meaning almost everyone who was in the coop program secured a work term this summer)\n\nI don't know, I chose software engineering because I really loved making small web and mobile apps, and always wanted to know how video games work, but it is really burning me out right now with all this interview prep and the disappointment I am getting after getting rejected even though I felt I did really well. It's endless cycle of rejections. I really want some advice as to what should I be doing next? Switching to some other engineering field? Go to grad school? Just give up? I am also really concerned as to whether I even have a chance to break into the career if this is the stage of internship interview, then new grad is almost next to impossible.\n\nAlso just to clarify, I am applying to everything, not just big name companies.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to code or do many 'technical' projects while on these teams and don't have any internship experience, so I'm considering myself as having 'zero-experience' although that's not completely true. I would like to switch roles to software engineering as I think this position better aligns with my interests and provides an opportunity to gain more useful and tangible skills.

[I saw this older post from the FAQ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/6e0dm4\/are_remote_entry_level_positions_rare\/) about finding entry level remote positions, and how rare it is. Now that we've been working from home for the last year I imagine (or hope) that there would be more opportunities for entry level remote work? If that's the case, any advice on where to look? If not remote, what would be the best listings to find entry-level positions?\n2. It will be easiest for me to pivot internally but am interested in exploring other companies. I'm not sure if being at Microsoft is a better help considering my role but, is there anything you think I could do to better my chances of switching companies (beyond \"doing side projects\")?\n3. I'm currently going through CTCI and attempting a couple LeetCode problems a day (studying Java). My coding experience is limited to Java and C which I studied in school. I know that lots of companies use more modern languages such as React, TypeScript, etc. Is it necessary for me to learn these to standout as 'relevant' (such as taking a bootcamp course, or doing a side project in these languages)?  I know \"anything helps\" but 'm trying to optimize my studying since I have a full-time job.\n\nI may need some help deciding on whether to pivot companies or try to move internally (and then pivot) but would like to start here.

For reasons I don't want to get into, I decided that's not the path I want to take, I want to just do programming full-time. I do a little bit of SQL and Python at work, but not enough to satisfy me, or tell interviewers that I did proper software development in those languages, mostly bug fixes and scripting.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't have any real internships, I just volunteered on-and-off for about a year and a half on a website my friend made, it was C#, MS SQL, and Bootstrap. I wrote maybe like 10 web pages of varying complexity, with a lot of guidance from my friend. My friend stopped doing the website several months ago and I can't really carry it on, I don't have the permission or expertise, as he pretty much told me what to write and only I understood some (but not all) of it, though towards the end I was getting more independent. \n\nThe C# stack my friend used is pretty old, I really don't see many jobs requiring any of the front-end stuff we used; it's all react\/angular and typescript\/javascript now from what I'm seeing. In the few technical interviews I've made it to, they're surprised\/disappointed I don't know REST, MVC, or Javascript. The jobs I'm applying for I can usually do fine in the interviews and pass the (easy) coding assessment, I just don't think I tick the boxes for recruiters or hiring managers because my stack isn't really common anymore.\n\nAs all my C# experience sorta ended several months ago, I'm really rusty on remembering how certain things worked and my friend really isn't available to help me with that stuff.

I don't really care if I'm front-end or back-end, I just want a job and obviously the least amount of extra work I have to do after working 40+ hours a week would be nice. Are there other things I should prioritize learning instead?

I had posted this:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/dflwh8\/salary_negotiation_question\/\n\nSo after I posted this I was pretty persistent about my promotion with my manager.  Because I was designing the system rewrite from the ground up, I believed I satisfied the SWE III requirements.\n\nMy manager didn't really agree, which was really disappointing, and he seemed to be ambivalent about the whole situation.  He didn't understand that my promotion had to be put in before a certain date and missed it.  This was January 2020.\n\nAt that point I escalated it two levels up and had a one on one with the manager of all software engineering for my company.  He was definitely more receptive but was also trying to make the point that I was \"silo'ed\" and needed to do more stuff to get my work noticed.\n\nCoincidentally a month later we had a huge project come in with an incredibly aggressive timeline.  I was able to shift gears quickly and help complete the project, being a fundamental part of it.  This brought us up into March of 2020. \n\nThen COVID hit and I was told that I was SOL and come back in 3-6 months.  That sucked a lot especially since I had busted my ass for a huge company win.  I basically went on cruise control for the next several months, and kept inquiring about my promotion once the 3 month mark had passed.  I started looking for new employment during the summer, just passively and when I had time.  I had probably a dozen interviews over the past year to varying levels of success, some I got really close to closing.\n\nMy manager kept checking and the answer was always no.  As fall and winter rolled around I started nagging more about it.  It was pretty rough, on one end you have corporate saying \"there is no hiring freeze\" but then your manager saying \"all adjustments are on hold.\"  \n\nI had to sit through multiple town halls where they paraded marquees of all the people who did get promotions.  It felt like everyone was getting a promotion BUT ME.  At this point my manager had done a complete 180 and was pretty angry I had been neglected.  During my 2020 performance review I got the highest possible rating.\n\nDespite all this, the corp still tried to say no to my promotion.  This brings us to March 2021.  Upon hearing their refusal again I got more aggressive with my job search.  There were some murmurings that my promotion was going through but it was still taking forever and I was given no ETA.\n\nAfter taking a hackerrank from a company and probably getting what I would consider a C- to D+ on it (finished 4\/5 of the problems, most without all test cases fulfilled) I was able to secure an offer of 85k.  I told my employer I was going to leave if they weren't able to get my promotion and more than the offer by Friday.\n\nI was contacted the next day by the manager of software engineering and asked for my range, which I said was 90-100.  He offered me my promotion and 80 on the spot which I turned down, and was confused by.  Pretty much said give me 90-100 or I'm walking.\n\n24 hours later I had secured the promotion to level 3 and a new salary of 90k a year.  It's amazing how fast these things can turn around when you threaten to walk.  I'm pretty happy now, and I didn't want to leave the company I work for because it has great perks and an awesome work life balance.\n\nThanks for reading!","created_utc":1620142439,"name":"t3_n4r9hi","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n4r9hi\/salary_negotiation_update\/","author_link_karma":18,"author_comment_karma":6,"score":39,"author_created_utc":1570647635,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":1,"author":"cscarta2019"},{"id":"n4qyw9","author_name":"Dracyth","title":"Defense contracting or government employment?","body":"I've been with the federal government for one year, fresh out of school with a 3.7 GPA at a B-tier state school.

I did everything as good as I could and people were impressed, but they did not take me because they said that the project had no future, since it was too different.\nFirst job: was hired as a ML developer in the testing department and was the only Machine Learning developer in the firm.

After the summer, I was offered the opportunity to co-op part-time while finishing up my last year of school. I graduate in just a couple of weeks now.\n* In February, I asked my boss about a potential full-time position after I graduate. After some back and forth, he basically said that quarterly results would depend on whether or not a position would be available. However, I would be given the option to extend my co-op until August to see if any more positions open up then.\n* In April, I bring up the question again. He says that at the moment he can't tell me anything. \n* Yesterday I asked him if my next steps at this company were to continue the co-op or if any positions have opened since I graduate soon. I have not gotten a response as of the writing of this post.\n\nWhile I understand that the bottom line ultimately affects the availability of positions, this company has also been hiring for similar positions while I've been co-op'ing for them, so I find the 'quarterly results' reasoning to be a bit questionable.\n\nThat being said, I can tell that my boss has definitely made an attempt to get me a full-time position since he has generally been impressed with my work. I have a feeling that he couldn't tell me anything in April because he was in the middle of discussing it with the company.\n\nAs for the lack of response from yesterday's email, I think it's most likely because he thinks that I'm going to leave if he tells me there isn't a position now. \n\nI haven't had trouble landing interviews, and I know that it's only a matter of time before I land a position somewhere.

I graduated a year ago in May 2020 and getting to for a famous entertainment\/tech company seems like a dream come true. This internship pays me 1\/3rd less than what I\u2019m being paid right now. Here are some thoughts I had about this scenario: \n\nIf I leave my current company and go for Disney, I\u2019m going for something... \n\n1. I have a chance for something that seems like a lifetime! It\u2019s like you rather go for something and say you did it rather than regretting later that you should have done it \ud83d\ude2d \n2. My dream company is Disney \n3. It might open opportunities for me because I work for Disney at a certain period \n4. And I\u2019m looking for a job now anyway trying to get out of my current job! \n5. It\u2019s 6 months and the job isn\u2019t secure \n\nIf I decline the offer from Disney,\n\n1. I don\u2019t like my job that I\u2019m currently at and I\u2019ll keep thinking about declining that offer I had from my dream company that I had a chance to! \n2. I have a full time job now vs 6 months at Disney.\n3. My associates I work with now are amazing which I can make new friends at Disney so I\u2019m not too worried about that. \n4. The pay is way more here than in Disney \n5. Can work and still make money while looking for a new job rather than a deadline if I were at Disney \n\nI am so excited about this opportunity but the thought of leaving my current full time job for \u201cjust a 6 month internship\u201d, which makes me so overwhelmed! \n\nI started this job last December 2020, and my internship begins in August 2021! I had an internship with Disney back in August 2020 but it got canceled due to COVID - 19.  I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m risking for something that isn\u2019t secure when I have something already secured. And I know my parents wouldn\u2019t be too happy with that as well. I want to ask for time off but 6 months seems like a lot of time. \n\nI\u2019m 23 and I live with my parents. I\u2019m saving a lot of money now but my current job requires a lot of relocation in the future for higher positions. The situation at home is getting unbearable which is why I\u2019m always out all the time until I have to come home.\n\nSo it really feels like I\u2019d be wasting this opportunity if I I don\u2019t take it. And this internship is a big change for me where I feel like I can\u2019t say no. But I feel like if I leave my full time position for something that\u2019s temporary - I would feel very uptight about it. \n\nI\u2019m afraid I may be making a huge mistake for my future and feel so indecisive as to the pathway I should take.

I'm also graduating in a month, so luckily enough, I wouldn't have to job hunt after that.\n\nHowever, in the long run, Support isn't what I would like to do. Moreover, my mentor at the company says that, after a year of working in support, I would be able to switch to a team of my liking, depending on my skills, ofcourse.\n\nAnd here's where I'm stuck.

I have some knowledge of iOS app development, so that seems like a possible alley too.\n\nTo give you a clear picture, here is my list of preference, and how much I know I'm each:\n\n1. Full Stack\/Web Dev - Good with front end (just, good); okay with backend, need to be a lot better; can learn database, it's been more that 2 years since I typed a query\n\n2. iOS - Only learning a little but of Swift, still not good, but will be soon\n\n3.

What can I do to help him or the situation?","body":"TLDR; husband is depressed and overwhelmed and stopped working again. But we are in debt for his startup. What can I do?\n\n\\---\n\nMy husband has been doing startups for over 8 years. He has been as an executive within several startup companies in the first few years, then he started to do his own startups one after another. He failed at most of it. One of them is however still alive but he got a fight with his former partner so he left that company.\n\nLast year he got really depressed and not working for half of year. This year, he got another idea and found another guy who he found really happy to work with as business partners so they started a new company. He was super excited and felt happy again. He's been meeting people for several months and I would say he's actually doing very well at impressing people. But recently he started to be depressed again. I think he tends to get tired or overwhelmed by the things he doesn't like to do (exp, real management work, financial, etc), and he keeps having new ideas he wants to do and gets distracted. Also he borrowed some money so I think he's also very anxious about finance. Anyway, recently since he's depressed, he basically stopped working, instead, he watches TV and playing video games most of the time.\n\nI don't know what to do. I tried to cheer him up or ignore his emotions and just focusing my own stuffs, but it didn't help. I tried to talk to him a long time ago (this kind of situation is not the first time, it happens to him a lot) and he just got more depressed or angry, or he went to work the rest of that day but return to play games the next day...I wasn't anxious when he borrowed the money, because I thought it's normal in the beginning phase, but now I am really worried. One day, he said he wanted to go to restaurants, but I said we are in debts so we should save any little pennies. But he disagreed and still went out.\n\nI'm not just worrying about finance, I'm more worried about him. With his serial entrepreneurship history, I think a lot of companies will avoid hiring him if someday he wants to go back to be an employee. Also because he was either CTO or CEO, so a lot of senior developer positions will just overlook him. The last reason I'm worried is because, it looks like if he fails this time or abandons it again, he will think his life is completely over and it will be very hard for him to get back to his feet again.","created_utc":1620072242,"name":"t3_n45u9n","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n45u9n\/im_worried_about_my_husband_whos_doing_a_startup\/","author_link_karma":1,"author_comment_karma":2,"score":6,"author_created_utc":1620069244,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"throwaway-foobar"},{"id":"n45m4c","author_name":"tomathoe","title":"Help me decide between two offers?","body":"Offer One: \n\n* 93k total comp \n\n* C#, angular, js, html, css.\n\n* glassdoor reviews are trash. many talk about about the CEO being a douche, people randomly getting fired, unsafe covid practices, etc.\n\nOffer Two:\n\n* 100k total comp \n\n* java, springboot, jsp.\n\n* glassdoor reviews are positive when it comes to the CEO and WLB. \n\nI am leaning towards offer #2 because the comp is higher and WLB seems better.

A little background about me... I graduated from a MS in Math last May. I have extensive coursework in math\/stats\/CS\/ML, did a computation-heavy thesis (simulations in Python, not ML) which led to a publication as first author, and taught undergrad calculus. My university was a no-name state university in a rural area with few connections to tech and I don't have much of a network. I have no industry experience\/internships -- I intended to do a PhD but realized it wasn't for me.\n\nDue to health issues I've been taking time off after graduating. I've sharpened my technical skills and completed a few projects in the last few months and have started applying for jobs. I think my background and interests are most suited to a DS role; however, these roles seem to be highly contested by PhDs and people with several YoE. My math background should put me ahead of many candidates (e.g. non-quantitative BS + MSDS), but I feel my lack of a PhD or previous experience prevents me from being a strong candidate. Also, because of how poorly-defined DS roles are, I get the sense a lot of companies don't know what they're looking for, and the interviews can test you on anything.\n\nI've heard that starting as a analyst or SWE is a better route into DS\/ML. I'm not really interested in the dashboarding and SQL duties that an analyst role entails. I've learned some web dev skills (Django, JS\/React, etc.) to deploy ML models and think a SWE (web dev) role could be fitting. I'd have to practice LC like hell, though.\n\n**Given my background should I apply to DS or SWE positions to optimize my chance of landing a job?** I'm more aligned with DS, but it is insanely competitive at entry level, and my callback rate has been low.

One as a teller and another in the call center and some landscaping work. I just want something more for myself and I don\u2019t want my age to be a factor as to yeah I should have this and that figured out, etc. \n\nI started school at my local community college in the fall of 2019, I finished up my last 2 gen Ed\u2019s, college algebra and csc 111. The following spring I took precalc 1 and csc 112 and ended up failing those classes because the pandemic started and zoom classes just wasn\u2019t doing it for me (yes I know that\u2019s a bad excuse and I should of passed). So fast forward to now, I will be taking precalc 1 & 2 this summer.\n\nMy goal is to take all the lower level CS classes at my community college and transfer them back to the university I first attended. At that point I will have to finish my upper level courses, electives and another math class (calc 2 I think it is).\n\nAt my community college, I have 7 classes left to take:\nComputer science 2\nDatabase management systems \nData structures and algorithms \nDiscrete mathematics \nCalc 1  \nPrecalc 1 & 2\n\nAll the classes above except precalc 1 & 2 are transferable to university.\n\nOkay so I guess that\u2019s a lot of background info...but my question is it worth going back to school at this age?

He keeps pushing me to work on this platform when he is of no help at all (his idea of helping is asking me for a design change when I hardly know what I'm doing) and is deviating from the internship agreement where I was supposed to be learning ml. I did try to express my unhappiness (quite poorly, I must admit) but nothing has changed. Also to note this a research team, and my internship allowance is paid for by another entity and not the company itself. I'm not an employee there.\n\nEdit: it was the 12th week into the internship that I had my first taste of ml, but was subsequently told to get right back to developing the platform. Also it's just strange that they are asking me to build the platform even before the ml model has been developed when the platform is supposed to be fore the model (I'm guessing it has something to do with my supervisors deliverables that's why he's pushing me to do it).","created_utc":1620033817,"name":"t3_n3rvyc","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n3rvyc\/my_supervisor_is_incompetent_in_the_work_he\/","author_link_karma":283,"author_comment_karma":495,"score":3,"author_created_utc":1514140669,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"badkitty93"},{"id":"n3ri8m","author_name":"pelle82","title":"What alternative careers are there for web developers?","body":"I  work as a web developer for an agency in UK.

But the caveat of this switch is maintaining a salary that helps out my fam for atleast now (willing to relocate anywhere I just help them financially). Wondering if it's doable and if so if you guys have advice.\n\n**Long Form Explanation Below:**\n\n1. I work at a semiconductor foundry as a materials engineer. I'm the guy trynna make sure the supply meets demand however, I want to switch over to CS because I don't like the location and I am decent at coding.\n2. With my background I didn't know which direction to go through so I went on free code camp and just went the web dev route. Thought why not.\n3. I want to leverage my previous technical experience so I was wondering if you all wanted to help me find my place in the Computer Science world. I already know python due to using for research before. However, the data science route seemed to be the most stringent on degrees and certifications. That's why I started to pick up web dev. Seemed the most fluid and I can knock out javascript and a couple projects by the end of the year.\n4. My only caveat with not leverging my current resume is that I do have a salary requirement. I am right now helping my family out and paying for their bills along with mine for now since they got screwed by the pandemic. It won't be for long but I would need to maintain my salary of 89k atleast to do so. Is that doable if I switch? I can leetcode very very well. I am learning the whole algorithms and data structures aspect but, my math background kinda helps out a lot (I dual majored in math in college). This whole thing got brought up because my friend at Capital One landed about that much starting off in Texas. But I don't know if he was a fluke.

Contemplating a career-shift to Psychology! Am I crazy?","body":"So, a bit of context.\n\nI've been in tech for a bit less than 4 years now. Initially, I was working with a lot of technologies like .NET\/Android\/Deployement as an intern\/Jr Developer. But since mid-2018 I've been mostly working in Front-end. In these 4 years, I've worked at 3 different companies (a small tech service company, a big product based e-commerce firm, and a couple years-old decently funded startup). So, it's safe to say that I've seen it all.  \n\n\nBack in high-school I had a huge interest in CS and always aced the CS exams and that's the reason I got a CSE degree (from a below-average school with average grades). But that's not the case now. Since the past 2 years, I'm constantly doubting if CS is really the right career for me. To be honest, the only reason I'm in tech is because it pays well. But, there's no gurantee that 10 years from now, there would still be such high salaries for software engineers. Currently the demand-supply ration is skewed towards engineers (for mid and senior positions). But, with 10 year olds learning to code in school, It's hard to envision what the future will be.\n\n  \nI'd love to study CS concepts even if I wasn't paid to do it. But working in the industry, it just induces so much anxiety to me on a daily basis. One reason for that is that I'm just not good enough and I'm probably mediocre at best (possiblly low-iq or I'm just not wired that way). But even if that were true, I see a lot of mediocre guys who are living a stress-free life.\n\n  \nThe reason for my anxiety is that there's so much to wrap your head around and it's hard to keep up if you want to stay in the industry. Due to living in constant hell, I'm considering a career-shift in psychology due to the following reasons:\n\n1. It would help me understand myself better and figure out the issues I'm going through\n2. I've always been intersted in how the brain functions what causes addictions.\n3. It woud give me some time to heal my brain\n4. Psychology degrees are not as demanding as CS (from what I've heard). This could be a chance to explore other interests and figure out what I really want to do with my life.\n\n  \nPlan is to go for a master's degree and then probably go into a specalised field where I could use both, my CS and Psych degree or work my way towards a Phd.\n\nI don't know if I'm delusional or just straight up crazy. But, life's too short.  I don't want to be 80 and have regrets that I just wasted my life doing something I wasn't enjoying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr;**\n\nWorkign as a software engineer in the industry is mentally taxing.

Pay is what the average intern makes in 2020 ($25\/hr), and I am part time. I like the job I guess, but I don't have any work experience in CS related fields besides this one, so what do I know about whether I really like it or not lol. I've been here for 2 months, by the end of month 3 I am apparently supposed to either get fired or be offered a full time position there (I am like 90% sure I'm getting a full time offering fwiw). No idea what the full time salary would be, but I imagine its probably around $36\/hr? Just based off vague salary discussions with my friend who works there lol\n\nI feel like I have so little experience, and so I feel a desire to reach out and just acquire as many work experiences as possible. To me, working somewhere new often seems like an important thing to do since I'm young and trying to dip my feet in the water you know? But my friend says its too soon and I should at least get a full year with this company, saying that it looks bad if I were to work somewhere for less than a year. However, don't internships carry the connotation of being a work thing that is understood to not have to be a year+ endeavour? So I was thinking maybe I could get away with only working there for 3-4 whatever months, and then snagging a new job that hopefully teaches new things and experiences I wouldn't normally learn from working at this specific company. I have to acknowledge though, I am so new to a lot of software engineering that if I worked at this company for a full year I know I would learn plenty of software development...\n\nI made a bullet list of reasons I want to and don't want to leave. I was wondering if anyone here could graciously offer their advice\/suggestion on what I should do? **Should I try to find a new job after working at an internship for 3-4 months, or stay with the company for a full time SW Eng. position because its too short of a time to dip out?**\n\nReasons I want to leave:\n* I feel a strong urge to get many different work experiences while I'm young\n* I want to work abroad badly. I'd stay with this job if they let me work remote 100% of the time temporarily, like for a 6 month span so that I could live abroad, but I highly doubt that they'd let me do that even if covid is still going on\n* Not 100% sure, but I think I could find a job with better pay than this company without much difficulty. I just say that because I think its a small enough company and the nature of the company + my experiences so far makes it seem like the kind of company that compensates for paying employees less by giving them greater work freedom\/control over their actual programming and promising better wlb.\n\nReasons I don't:\n* This company has incredible wlb, definitely better than almost all other places\n* I actually work with a long time college friend here who helped me get the job, I would definitely miss working with him but you know, if its better for my future career prospects I'm not gonna stay at one company forever just to work with a friend","created_utc":1619979040,"name":"t3_n3c7oi","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n3c7oi\/should_i_find_a_new_job_after_my_internship\/","author_link_karma":1065,"author_comment_karma":493,"score":1,"author_created_utc":1618768303,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"perceivedpleasure"},{"id":"n3c4x2","author_name":"Nevadaguy22","title":"New grad looking for helpful resources","body":"I'm graduating in less than 2 weeks and I'm trying to find my first entry level SWE job.

When I raised certain concerns about the ability to integrate a new technology into multiple projects that all currently have different build library dependencies and asked about a compromise solution that has been brought up before, I was told that I need to show more respect to the time that was put in to the current proposed solution and that they felt they were only hearing excuses for not wanting to use a new technology (note that I am not the only one to raise these questions before this happened).\n2. When a discussion about this technology was held with a wider group of people that are involved in projects that would be incorporating this new technology at some point (some relatively soon and other a bit later), another person brought up the issue about the build library dependencies (and other issues) and suggested the same compromise solution I did in the previous meeting and I made mention of a task that we had planned for testing that possible issue (this was the outcome of the previous mentioned meeting). Just me bring this up made the same person from the previous meeting tell me that it was an inappropriate setting to bring this up (which I though was odd as that task directly relates to the question that was asked) and that he feared that what I am doing is trying to spread unfair fear and doubt about this technology (other people have brought up other \/ similar concerns but maybe this person thinks they are only doing that because of me or something).\n\nIf people want to disagree with my opinions or even concerns that I had, I have no problem with that, I am not a stranger to being in the minority when it comes to certain opinions on how to proceed with things but the outcomes of these disagreements are always based on data in some form and not accusing other people of lying or making things up to get their way.

Also note that there is nobody to help me label the images or to create datasets, I spend my time building datasets and implementing machine learning pipelines for this system. 50% of my time, I write new features for the code base I make, and the other 50% I test and make sure everything works (physically on the machine \/ hardware setup) without glitches. There were times when I had to literally go and solder connections between different microprocessors in different modules of this system. I had to setup the system infrastructure (Nvidia GPU Compute server + Network based control and integration different electronic subsystems) and Software Architecture from absolute scratch.\n\nNow the CEO (an asshole) keeps pushing new features one after the other like a feature creep, he doesn't care what I do, he doesn't understand shit about code. Nobody at this startup codes. Recently, he has stopped caring about this project like there are no meetings, or so regrading this major project. He gives a big fuck to the smallest things like why is there dust on the robots? (LOL). So recently, This Boomer CEO is like can you teach me how to code so he can do my job(lol wtf?) .

After reading a couple of blog posts on employee experience at FAANG(all major tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple) and in other companies like Stripe, Lyft, Razorpay,etc, I have noticed something which I think might be crucial to career growth.\n\nSo I was reading about the procedure at Google, where there is promotion committee. You submit a report on how your contributions to Google helped it and why you should be promoted. Now this committee has never seen your work before and decides whether you should be promoted based on the application. But not everything is quantifiable, like how someone helped his teammates or made documentation for legacy project, etc. These things do not really have well defined metrics. So I believe there are many who work at FAANG but are not promoted easily. They are stuck at the same level for quit a few years.\n\nOn the other hand, companies like Stripe, or startups, etc, although may not provide similar benefits like FAANG, but due to their relatively smaller teams provide better communication among members. This does not mean easy promotion but this also does not mean that individual contributions are not noticeable.\n\nSo my doubt is, if I work at a big tech company for say 4-5 years but with no or just one promotion, then decide to quit and look for job at some other company, is the absence of promotion going to hurt my chances to get a job even though I used to work at the big tech company?\n\nOr if I work at startup, get a few promotions, and then look for job elsewhere, is that better?\n\nNow I am not saying big companies don't promote. One could argue that if one is competent enough company will promote that person. It is just that, since I haven't yet experienced working at a company, I don't know if the competent thing really plays that big of a role in real world or does show business has its role to play too.","created_utc":1619930184,"name":"t3_n2z5jh","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n2z5jh\/how_does_promotion_in_one_company_play_a_role_in\/","author_link_karma":22,"author_comment_karma":11,"score":12,"author_created_utc":1616824013,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"ExtensionAd770"},{"id":"n2yw5o","author_name":"oxamide96","title":"Is Georgia Tech the only online computer science graduate school worth considering?","body":"Given that it is online, very cheap compared to others, and from a top-tier university, it is seeming like a no-brainer to me.

I quit because it was far away from my dreams and I have never been interested in any degree other than STEM degrees. \nSo I quit and started studying. I got medicated for my ADHD, learnt how to be disciplined for the first time in my life.

This is a question\/rant at myself.\n\nI have 3 semesters left (including this one) before graduating. Since college started, I've been trying to land an internship. I spread myself too thin trying to learn a lot of skills needed by the internships I find. I finally managed to interview once and I passed a technical interview but I sucked at the \"management\" interview (the one where they ask you behavioural questions) so I was rejected (they didn't tell me the reason, I just assumed that it's the management interview because it came after the technical one).\n\nIt's frustrating. Every internship requires a different set of skills (at least the ones in my country) and I always feel like my skills and projects aren't enough. Right now, my resume has many skills but I'm not really good in most of them, if I had to use them I will need to review and learn more about them.\n\nMeanwhile, I sort of neglected studying college subjects, telling myself I'll learn them later, but I now regret it. Maybe if I focused on studying the core CS subjects and did a decent project in each of them, I would have more opportunities when I graduate (e.g., be ready to do a master's).\n\nBut I'm still not sure if I should focus the time I have left solely on that or if I should still try to pursue internships. I think initially my desire to find an internship was a dumb one. I think it was along the lines of \"I want to be like Mark Zuckerberg\" or something. I thought I was special just because I started programming at 10 but boy was I wrong. Because of my humongous ego, I made a lot of bad decisions. I kept comparing myself to my colleagues who started interning or freelancing, one of them even worked as a full-fledged SWE in multiple companies!\n\nAnother reason of why I was rushing things so much is because of my anxiety that my chances of finding a job after I graduate will be very low without an internship. A lot of the companies I've seen are either looking for interns or senior devs.\n\nSo right now, I'm confused. I want to know if my fear is justified and if there's a rational reason people pursue internships during college. Right now, the only thing I can think of is money and experience. I need both but more importantly I need knowledge. I don't want to call myself an engineer if I don't have good grasp on these topics (I'm talking about OS, databases, distributed systems, even compilers).\n\n**TL;DR** I wasted a lot of time trying to land an internship but never did. Now I have 2.5 semesters left and I want to know if there's a merit in pursuing an internship or if I should just focus on college.\n\n**Edit** Some details about me:\n\n* I'm from Egypt\n* 2.7 GPA\n* I don't mind working in non-FAANG, in fact I've seen better working environments than FAANG\n* I would prefer living and working in a different country, if my job affords me to\n* I will probably need to work a while after graduating because I can't afford a Master's unless it's a scholarship or something","created_utc":1619893358,"name":"t3_n2o3ac","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n2o3ac\/are_internships_during_college_worth_pursuing\/","author_link_karma":273,"author_comment_karma":162,"score":2,"author_created_utc":1517927729,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"LuggageMan"},{"id":"n2o2h3","author_name":"ThePika007","title":"Move from Desktop Development to Web technologies","body":"I have done my masters in Software Engineer and since then i have been working in C# technology on desktop application.

Looking for suggestions on whether to take my career path towards MLE vs SWE vs PM\n\nHi! To provide some context, I'm currently an NLP applied scientist. I chose this job because I wanted to get into ML -- however, working with almost all PhDs my imposter syndrome is going through the roof. Also, I've never been very strong in math, I somehow got through college and my masters taking no math classes lol, but my current job assumes a strong basis in linear algebra. I am working in research but I don't like it -- I find it difficult to write papers and come up with new solutions to existing problems. \n\nWhy MLE: I think ML problems are super interesting, but my current AS role is very research focused.  I want to move out of this to hopefully something further away and closer to prod (i.e. what I think is the MLE role). Would my lack of math background be my Achille's heel here as well?\n\nWhy SWE: I did pass HC at Google for SWE a year ago when I was fresh out of college (though I chose not to go b\/c of the opportunities in ML) and made it into some other companies, so I think that my interviewing skills for SWE are not too bad. If I will have imposter syndrome forever as long as I'm in ML, going to SWE may not be a bad idea. Another plus is that I enjoy coding.\n\nWhy PM: Honestly not too sure of what the day-to-day of a PM looks like. However, I've actually grew up interested in humanities since I was a child until the middle of college (was always an aspiring writer\/journalist), so I think that public speaking and writing are some of my bigger strengths I have that I am unable to use as an engineer. Though I enjoy it, I do not necessarily think coding needs to be part of my job (though I do want to stay in tech) and I think that my past experience in ML and my strengths in writing\/speaking may be a plus.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!","created_utc":1619887031,"name":"t3_n2lylp","permalink":"\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/n2lylp\/need_advice_mle_vs_swe_vs_pm\/","author_link_karma":1,"author_comment_karma":1,"score":2,"author_created_utc":1597294554,"rule_1":0,"rule_2":0,"author":"Visible-Touch7131"},{"id":"n2lj0u","author_name":"This-is-it-2021","title":"Got my first Junior Software dev job, and I hate it here. HELP!","body":"At 30 years old, I recently made the switch to a career in tech. Completed a bootcamp and landed my first junior software dev role a month ago, during my interview I asked about onboarding and training, I was told there would be training.\n\nI got hired at a small start up with a dev team consisting of 3 other people: 1 software architect and 2 other junior devs. The company\u2019s goal is to build a complex social media platform from scratch within 4 months. This first job has been absolute hell. \n\nMy onboarding process was to code a calculator in 4 days using a language and library I have never used before. My code for the calculator was never reviewed lol but the software architect believes that was enough training to now build strong working features for this platform. The problem is the SA has created a toxic environment where questions are answered with sarcasm and condescending tones. There is no structure, no documentation, the SA has no interest and no time to mentor me or spend time going over expectations. The SA is building the platform how he wants so all the code structure lives in his head and he doesn\u2019t particularly care to take time and explain anything to us. I understand he\u2019s in a shitty position where he has to build this huge platform singlehandedly with 3 Junior devs who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\n\nHe\u2019s been in the industry for 20 years and somehow expects us Junior devs to be able to pick up on his code quickly and churn out tickets in these sprints. Some of the tickets are beyond my scope of knowledge or skill. Whenever we have company meetings he always says \u201cI encourage my devs to ask questions\u201d and when I do ask questions it\u2019s met with hostility and impatience, and some rude comments about how annoying I am.\n\nHe spends a lot of time trolling me or the 2 other Junior devs when we take long to complete a ticket or he straight up tries to humiliate me and other juniors during our dev meetings if we make mistakes. He has literally given me an eye roll emoji as feedback. If I try and stand up for myself and explain I am new and still learning, it makes him troll even harder. I don\u2019t feel I am being given the grace to be a Junior dev and to make mistakes without fear of consequence and to learn in a safe environment. I feel like I\u2019m being set up for failure rather than success. I am not looking to be spoon-fed or have my hand held but this has been 4 weeks of insanity. I\u2019m tired of feeling like an incompetent dev, because of the lack of support and structure.\n\nI don\u2019t have a HR department and this is really taking a toll on my mental health. I am stressed all of the time, my anxiety is at an all time high, I can\u2019t ask for help without fear of being judged and ridiculed. I am constantly made to feel stupid. After speaking with peers I realize this is not a normal experience for a Junior dev. I\u2019m trying to stick it out so it doesn\u2019t look bad on my resume but I don\u2019t think I can last much longer in this demoralizing environment. \n\n I don\u2019t know if this is a \u201cgrass is greener on the other side\u201d moment. Any advice is welcome and appreciated. Sorry for the long rant. \n\nTLDR: I\u2019m a junior dev working at a start up with one senior architect who has no interest in explaining anything.

This sub is bigger, and I feel I'll get more advice here than in a more focused sub.\n\nI graduated two years ago, no job applications put out, but I've been trying to force myself to get the hang of web and app development; basically because it's like a foundation for security. I assumed if I want to secure apps, it's best I first know how to build them, but I have no flare for web & mobile app development anymore. It's like I'm forcing myself to do something I'm not interested in. I used to like development a decade ago, but somewhere along the line the passion for it died. I can read code and understand it to an extent and research what I don't, but I don't have that drive to build any sort of web or app-store type mobile app. \n\nInstead of wasting years on a skill I'm not interested in, I'm thinking of diving into the pool I'm truly interested in; security. To be specific, the technical side of it. I'm interested in pentesting, injections, building and understanding scripts\/malwares\/ITSec-tools, cryptography (love maths), and bug hunting. \n\n- What other technical paths\/titles can I pursue in the security field? I'm not really interested in the theories of information & cyber security, but I will read up on theories that I need to. But from going through the security subs, I saw majority of the field rarely works with code. They do so mostly to create tools only. \n\n- Another thing that holds me from going into the general cyber\/network security space and kept me trying to master app and web development is freelancing. I'm not really one that enjoys office weekdays 9-5 working. That's more reason why I like penetration testing. I can work from home or as a contractor. So I would like job roles that can allow me freelance or work part time and\/or remotely.\n\nBasically, I'm tired of forcing myself to get the hang of web and app development; front end, back end, frameworks, etc. I'm tired of all that - it's annoying just to type and think about. Maybe because of how crowded and diluted the field is, to me. Either way, no desire comes from those topics. I want to transition into something still technical, but not a front-end\/back-end based development type job. I loved my cryptography course in school, although hard, it was a challenge I enjoyed. I know I'll love everything technical about cyber & network security.

Looking to move into a different part of the company focused on either AI or emerging tech or products\/services. I have 3 leads\/interviews and wanted to get your thoughts on the pros\/cons. Assume salary is same for all the positions and they are all internal transfers. Also, all are manager positions with direct reports.\n\n1. Manage a team of data scientists, software engineers, systems analysts, and business analysts spread over 3 countries to optimize and scale an AI and ML based program to reduce operating costs of the company. So in other words, automate and digitize internal processes and even customer facing troubleshooting (currently done by techs). Team is highly technical, competent, and experienced but lacks direction, role definition, and structure.\n2. Manage a team of business analysts, project managers, and program managers to identify emerging disruptive technologies in smart building and smart cities space for M&A or strategic partnership opportunities. Work is primarily focused on identification and evaluation of technologies and companies so it is pseudo technical with some business analysis.
