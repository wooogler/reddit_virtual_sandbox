    "body":"I am a fresh grad that is struggling to get a job. I applied to 100+ jobs with 2 interviews and both rejected. I recently got contacted by Synergistic IT. It seems like they are a boot camp + staffing firm and their program sounds a bit too good to be true. They train you for 5 months then get you Java and AWS certificates and guarantee you a job at a salary from 80k to 120k. The only downside is that I have to pay 10k upfront and 15k after they get me a job. This all seems a bit too good to be true and I am not sure if I am being scammed or not. Can anyone that has done their training or know anything about them tell me what their honest reviews of them are? I would really appreciate any input, thank you so much.",

I just made it to the final round for a different company in Dallas and they've been great about expediting the process since I do have this other offer but the final interview would be a few days after the offer expiring. I've been told by my recruiter that I'd be looking at a base salary that's pretty much $15k higher than my current offer. While I'm confident that I'll do just fine in the final interview, I'm seeking some input from others as how to tread this situation.\n\nShould I ask for an extension for the first offer and not say anything about the new (potential) offer? I don't believe they will be able to match it as I already got the maximum salary for the position I was offered. I'm obviously trying to prepare for the worst and don't want to end up without an offer and nothing to fall back on. Another option would be to accept the current offer and then renege but I feel like that's sort of looked down upon?\n\nThanks!",

    "body":"Hi, I am a 2nd-year undergraduate student. I have to choose my major 2 or 3 months later.\n\nIn advance, sorry for not sufficient knowledge on technical domains and the Reddit platform. This is my first post on it.\n\nMy interest includes robotics algorithms (mapping, localization, motion planning, and so on), computer vision, machine learning, low-level programming, autonomous driving systems. I would like to work in the robotics industry as a software engineer or research engineer. To get job opportunities in these competitive areas, I plan to get a Master's degree or Ph.D. in a related area. I recently have got an internship (almost equals to a part-time job) as a computer vision engineer, which attracts me so much. So, I am eager to get deeper into these areas.\n\nBecause of my broad interest and probably vague understanding of these domains, however, I have trouble with deciding whether I will major in Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science.\n\nThe same kinds of questions are already posted, but courses of CS and ME are a little bit different from ones in general. For your better understanding of my situation, I give a brief explanation about departments in my university.\n\nThe department of Mechanical Engineering in the university where I learn provides so many courses about mechanics (heat, fluid, material, mechanisms), control (classical & modern), and mechanical designs based on CAD, but not enough ones about robotics software, especially about the algorithm area. In lab classes, they deal with more heat systems like engines, less intelligent robots, deep learning, or software (not zero).\n\nThe department of Computer Science provides a deep understanding of computer systems, algorithms, low-level programming, machine learning, compiler, and logic. Especially, since I like low-level programming and computer system, these kinds of classes strongly attract me. However, they learn nothing about engineering concepts such as control, signal processing, and robotics algorithms. In addition, they learn mathematics from so theoretical point of view, which does not seem to fit me. I like math, especially optimization and geometry, but classes like \"definition -> proof -> definition -> proof -> ...\" are boring for me. Historically, CS in my university derived from Math and belongs to the School of Science, not to the School of Engineering, so it is natural that professors studying pure discrete mathematics and pure logic in CS. In my view, though a CS degree is said to be good for jobs related to software, it is not necessarily true for robotics software.\n\nIn summary, it is a problem like \"Hardware side with so much mechanics and design or Software side with computer systems and a little bit too theoretical mathematics\".\n\nI hope to get some advice from those who are related to the robotics industry or academia.\n\nThanks for reading and answering, in advance.",

    "title":"Is going from Software Engineer to working in Game Development viable?",
    "body":"I've been working in my first software job for a few months now, and mostly enjoying it. We do government contracting so the work is pretty boring, but I get to work remote and make a good amount so I'm happy. Still, I've always thought it would be a lot of fun to work on games, and I'd be interested in branching out into that area at some point. You hear a lot of horror stories about the industry, so I was hoping to hear from people who have actually worked in game dev to see what it really looks like. It seems like you generally make less working in games than you would elsewhere, but that's not super important to me. Is it possible to get to the mid 100's range at the senior level? Are there a lot of opportunities for remote work?\n\nSecondarily, what can I do to improve my chances of getting into the field? Is having a few years of experience as a Software Engineer helpful, or should I focus more on having some solid games to show off? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",

    "body":"I have two offers for a java engineer I am trying to choose between and having a hard time deciding.  The pay is very similar and I like the people at both companies.  These would be greenfield applications.  First company is a small bank.  It is a small organization and they are using all the latest tech.  I think the learning security part would be cool as well, but worried about the work potentially becoming routine after a couple of years.  Second is a consulting company.  It would be a salaried position - B2B job, where the company contracts with a larger organization, goes onsite with the consulting companies staff members, spins up the project from the entire lifecycle and leaves.  The contracts would usually take  6 months to a few years to complete.  Both are backend heavy.    \n\nI'm leaning towards consulting mostly because of the variety.  Wondering if there were pros\/cons of either in these types of jobs (or maybe it would be too company specific for an opinion).",

    "body":"I worked at my last company for 5 years or so. It was one of those Kool-Aid drinking places where everyone is \"family\" and all that nonsense. During that time I had a bunch of managers, but my last one hated me from the get-go for some reason and my life a living hell. Right before the pandemic he called me all sorts of names, I went to his skip level, huge mess. I was ready to get out, and then the pandemic hit and suddenly jobs were hard to come by.\n\nThen with the pandemic the company laid off 1\/2 of their staff and it ruined what was left of the culture. Nobody trusted each other, everyone talked shit behind everyone's back, micromanagement, people constantly getting yelled at, coworkers that were friends turning on each other. It basically got to the point where I opened my laptop and wondered \"how am I going to get yelled at today?\"\n\nLong story short, I left that nightmare and started a new remote job. People from my old job are stalking my LinkedIn. I even had someone who still works there who I once considered a friend email me, tell me my boss talked shit on me for over 2 years in 1 on 1's (and still does), and that I was replaced by my boss's friend. I don't need old gossip in my life (and not sure what the point is to even rub my nose in this shit), so needless to say we don't speak anymore.\n\nSo long story short, after years of emotional abuse in the workplace I am having a bit of a hard time trusting my new coworkers. I keep waiting for my new boss to jump down my throat, or my coworkers to gossip about me, even though there's no inclination that either will happen. After years of passive aggressive code reviews, I'm trying not to project that tone on new people, but I can't help it. \n\nOther than good old therapy, do you have any work-place related tips on how to mentally \"start fresh\" with a new group of people? Has anyone else had a similar experience?",

I\u2019ve only ever taken long weekends off - mostly because COVID hit after being there for only a year.\n\nI had plans for 2 trips in 2020. First one was a personal week long vacation at a resort in Asia and then I found out a close friend was getting married...in Europe. My boss OK\u2019d this in 2019 - mostly because we didn\u2019t have much going on. Which I was super grateful for!\n\nThen COVID hit, everything was pushed out to the following year (2021). My friends wedding date was up in the air due to travel restrictions and the resort we booked cancelled our trip.\n\nAnd now - places are opening up in the US and my company is super busy. We\u2019re a very small manufacturing company and I do a lot here to keep things moving. We went from having no jobs going on for a few months to having numerous projects. My boss made a joke a couple months ago about how happy he was about the resort cancelling the trip and all I did was laugh because at the time no one knew where things would be. I didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nJust last week, my friend announced the wedding is officially back on for this fall. And even though my personal vacation is still cancelled due to the resort - my friends decided to choose a different location since were all vaccinated now. And I want to go...\n\nWe\u2019re understaffed and since I\u2019m doing multiple jobs, no one can really do my part. And no one at this company ever takes vacation time. \n\nMy friends and family say it\u2019s not my fault they can\u2019t find 3 new hires to relieve the extra duties I\u2019m doing and keep piling more work - just ask off.\n\nI just want other peoples perspective",

    "title":"Really need advice on whether or not to change jobs (really really LONG story)",
    "body":"Warning: Long Wall(s) of text\n\nI'll start by describing where I am now: I have 5 years experience. I have agreed via email to take a new job and have been sent the final contract to sign. I was sent the final contract yesterday. I have not signed it.\n\nNow, for a lot of background: Last September I was in the interview process with this same company. It is quite a big company, probably top 5 in my country (Asian). I initially reached out to them to apply. I got the offer, however, I turned them down because the salary increase wasn't really that much for jumping jobs, about a 20% increase. I do like my current job (100% WFH, this new one is not) so it wasn't worth it.\n\nSoon after I turned them down, my project at my current job ended due to unforeseen reasons. So in December I reached out to them and asked if the role was still available, they said no, but they will let me know next spring if\/when they have openings. So they did. I got an email in March. By  this time I still didn't actually have a project at work, basically having done nothing for 5 months. So I said yes. I tried to negotiate a few things with them but they would not budge on anything--no extra vacation days, not a single extra dollar in salary. Nothing. But whatever, I really wanted this job. I went through 1 more in-person interview with them. They did wonder why I was interested in the job again since I initially turned them down and I just told them the truth.\n\nThings took some time, and I finally agreed to the official offer letter in mid April. \\*\\*2 big differences\\*\\* comparing this offer and the one from last year--this is a 2 year contract offer, and last year's was permanent employment. This one also gives me a 28% raise compared to 20% last time. I wasn't thrilled about just a 2 yr contract, but well whatever.\n\n Then holy shit, literally the day I was set to tell my current job that I will be leaving at the end of May--I got a raise. Out of nowhere. I never asked for it or hinted to anyone. A 25% raise. When I got the initial email from my director, I thought I was getting fired. Now the 2 salaries are nearly identical--just a 3% difference between them. I did not tell the new job though, because I didn't want them to feel like I was stringing them along, especially since I turned down their offer last year. Then \\*after\\* that, \\*I\\* reached back out to them. So I said to myself, \"ok fine. You really have to just accept this. Very bad timing, but that's life. Stay true to your word, you accepted so it's the right thing to do.\" So I told my current job I will be resigning at the end of May, and I refused their raise. Now our 2 companies HRs are talking to get all visa stuff worked out for visa transfer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo then yesterday I finally got the final contract. And there are some things that are different, or were not included in the initial offer. For example, there is no mention of my bonus. Also the contract states that employees are not allowed to discuss salaries with anyone besides management. And it says something I (unfortunately) overlooked initially--the company can, at their sole discretion, extend the probation period indefinitely. It also states (not included in original contract) that in the event of termination, they can give me payment in lieu of advance notice. This is pretty bad for me because I am an international employee, so if I get fired my visa expires and I have 1 week maximum to pack all my stuff and leave the country--a country where I have mostly built my life the last 5 years.\n\nSo honestly at this point I just feel like this company is extremely stiff and rigid. In our first round of salary negotiations last year, they refused to budge at all. Then again during March they also refused to grant me a single thing I requested--they just said \"XYZ is standard for our international employees, we can't change it.\" It really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. And now, finally I get the final contract and my bonus is written out. I requested that they remove  their ability to extend the probation period, and they once again said they cannot remove that language, it is standard in all contracts.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from just refusing to sign is I want to keep my reputation. I feel like going back on them a 2nd time will destroy my local reputation and recruiters that they or others may know will think badly of me, and news will get around. Other than that, honestly, a 3% salary raise is not at all worth all this hassle. \n\nShould I try to stay at my current job (I am about 90% sure they would let me stay), or just suck up the missteps I've already made? Thanks for reading until the end.",

There's some mornings where I'll spend time crying because I'm just burned out and stressed; I've also started losing weight and my sleep schedule is really poor.

It would be a type of consulting, working for clients to deliver solutions but I would just be strictly on the developing team.\nAt my current company, been here for over 3 years now, I have been talking with them about moving into an open position in the software engineering department. After they said I had great interviews they gave me a vague timeline of maybe a few weeks to several months for when I could transition due to plans and such. I currently work for them doing some developing but mostly enhancements to 3rd party software purchased. I also have my hobby projects outside of work to try and keep up my skills as losing them is one of my fears with not doing this \u201cfull time\u201d currently. I also have a good relationship here with my bosses and coworkers, there isn\u2019t many people I don\u2019t mind working with.\n\nMy question is, do I take the new offer or hold out hope at my current company?",

    "title":"Learning Curves and Onboarding frustrations seem never-ending | Frontend",
    "body":"Hey everyone. Just for context, I'm a man and come from an ethnic minority, outside the US.\n\nI started programming shortly after College around 7 years ago, doing Java during my first job. Projects were boring all the time (desktop apps), and I was interested in doing web dev, so I decided to apply to a Frontend position and got hired in 2015 in a digital agency, where I've had the chance to work on a variety of projects using several of the most popular JS frameworks. It was there where I really learned the software development cycle, versioning, testing, among other stuff.\n\nThe first two years I used to engage in long learning curves whenever I started a new project (we do mostly outsourced maintenance of existing projects). I would spend hours reading documentation, testing, googling, and debugging during ramp-up phases. And I kinda hoped this curve would get shorter with time as I got more experienced. But the truth is that it never did.\n\nBecause of how diverse and complex FE projects can be technology-wise, every time that I have to switch to a new team or project, I feel like I am starting from scratch. Like day 1. There can be a new framework with hundreds of new dependencies that I've never seen in my life or a strange integration of js libraries that somehow somebody managed to put together to build a set of web forms that could've been easily implemented in a different approach.\n\nAnd it's so frustrating because I have to be asking tons of questions all the time, onboarding sessions are never enough and mentorship is nonexistent most of the time. I get stuck easily and it takes me forever to catch up. At a personal level, it makes me feel constantly incompetent and forever inexperienced until eventually, I manage to fully understand everything.\n\nI know code maintenance can be hell. And I know every project and every company is different. But in my case, I haven't had the luck to grow as much as I wanted during these years as a FE developer. Maybe maintenance doesn't make you grow as much. Maybe FE is actually a huge mess. Or maybe I have the wrong impression of how experience translates into learning curve times. But the truth is that it can be very overwhelming.\n\nHas anybody here gone through something similar?\n\nAny tips to speed up learning curves?\n\nThank you",

It's essentially my dream job because I get to work on something that I've been using for a couple of years now, but I'm feeling dumb and it's taking a toll on me mentally.\n\nI'm aware of imposter syndrome, and know that everyone experiences it. In fact, a senior engineer was telling me today that he still goes to our staff engineer every now and then and asks the same question he asked before (I try to avoid this to show that I'm learning and write things down).\n\nHowever, I can't help but feel dumb and useless when my team and I have a meeting discussing technical subjects I've never used\/have very little knowledge of, and stay silent the whole time because I don't even know what kind of question to ask, and I get increasingly reluctant to ask questions since we're all remote and don't want to be pinging my coworkers all day preventing them from doing their work. Some days I look at code and literally freeze up because I don't even know where to begin. \n\nMy coworkers are all really friendly, so it isn't a case of them showing toxic behavior like \"you should know this\" or anything like that (no matter how many times I create the scenario in my head that it secretly is). In fact, they've told me they like some of the ideas that I've implemented into our product to improve the user experience. \n\nHow do I get myself out of this mental state and fix this? I spend time outside of work each day learning whatever I don't understand that's discussed, but I don't want it to lead to burnout and impact my productivity and risk losing my job.",

    "body":"TLDR: first engineering job is toxic and I feel isolated and depressed. Got stuck doing shitty work and not learning. Working with senior dev who drives good engineers away and management has no intention to address it. Should I quit and focus on my mental health and interviewing? Or will that hurt my second job hunt a lot \ud83e\udd14 \n\nHi all. I\u2019ve been in my first engineering job for about 10 months and I\u2019ve been seriously contemplating quitting for about a month. It started off as a good experience because I had a great senior engineer mentor on my team but once she left I realized that she shielded me from working with the senior developer who everyone dislikes. She left during a reorg where both my supportive manager and coworkers that I like got moved to a different team and I was left working with people who are all doing their own things. The senior developer is the only one I get to work with and his code is bad, the whole team depends on him, and I got stuck doing shit work for months (moving an app to production) so I basically just spend all day trying to get his code to run on my computer and he\u2019s constantly changing it so I have to constantly meet with him. All of the code stuff I\u2019m doing is shitty configuration stuff and it\u2019s never ending. I\u2019m not learning or building and everyday I have to say \u201cstill working on the same thing\u201d in scrum. The senior dev is not friendly, very condescending, mansplained the terminal to me, and basically just does what he wants since he\u2019s been here forever. Adding on to all of that, I started my first job during the pandemic and throughout everything that\u2019s been going on with BLM, Stop asian hate, etc. no one on my team talks about what\u2019s going on. Add on to that that I\u2019m the only woman of color on a team of 20 men and I\u2019ve started hating and resenting my job to the point where I have crying breakdowns everyday. I\u2019ve also expressed my frustrations to my manager months ago and asked to get put on a different project but nothing has happened. I hate the company culture and a bunch of people have left my team as well. I\u2019ve given up on pushing for change here and I\u2019ve started job hunting. I\u2019m trying to hold out longer but part of me is wondering if I should just quit and focus on my mental health and interviewing. I have about 3-4 months of savings saved up as well. I\u2019m mostly concerned about losing negotiating power or having to job hunt\/explain my situation in interviews. I\u2019m also concerned about not having my first job tenure be a whole year & the idea of potentially not finding a job for months. Any thoughts? I\u2019m trying to hold out but my mental health is worse than it\u2019s ever been. \n\nAdvice would be much appreciated especially from people who have found a second eng job during Covid!",

    "body":"I've been feeling increasingly uneasy about my career as I go over my mid thirties. I don't think I'll ever enjoy managing people just to manage, but I do enjoy being a team leader and staying technical. Over the past 2 years I've been shadowing local dentists (9 month gap during pandemic) and really enjoyed it. I'm thinking of using my savings to fund my way through dental school, as the older dentists I shadowed had extreme work life balance, high salary, and job stability. They all typical work 32 hours over 4 days, no call, rare emergency overtime, and seem to get more desirable with age.\n\nThe cs folks I work with over 40 tend to take 2 paths. The lucky successful ones (10% of people or less) get m7 mbas and move into the upper echelons, making great money with terrible hours. The remaining 90% of people on my path tend to settle into middle management, face lay offs, lack autonomy, face wage stagnation, and generally seem unhappy.\n\nI applied to a competitive pre dental program with over 90% acceptance rate to dental schools but I'm getting cold feet as everyone I know is telling me it's not worth it (5 years long, 300k tuition plus lost wage). I'm also worried in the future dentistry will go cities l corporate and I'll be a slave to production.\n\nAm I wrong in thinking ageism will hurt me in my current career without a masters degree? Am I looking at dentistry with rose tinted glasses? Any older math\/cs folks regret staying in the career after 40?",

    "body":"Hello Everyone!\n\nOk, I'll cut to the chase here, I'm a senior year fashion design student starting to get curious about software engineering. \n\nMy primary reasons for career hopping, \n\n1. I like money.\n\n2. Fashion isn't exciting and there's no room for meaningful innovation. Besides which consumers are simply not interested in fashion, like yeah sure everyone wants a Louis Vuitton or whatever but there's no value for craftsmanship or design, only 'hype'. The pandemic has forced the industry into an existential crisis and it seems like a sinking ship to me.\n\n3. I want to be part of a meaningful community that doesn't have its head up it's a\\*\\*, tech\/coding\/UX\/UI seems like a nice bunch of people... but I don't know that yet.\n\n5. I don't want to live in NY\/Cali.\n\nI know people keep saying it's a trendy field and everyone is career-hopping into it but nonetheless, I have a few questions:\n\n\n1. Is it worth it? Will it stay relevant? Is the money good? Is the work culture good (or at least not as toxic as fashion)?\n\n2. Do I need another degree? I would rather not get another degree or Bootcamp. I'd rather be self-taught or a certificate. Is that a legitimate route to go or will I be wasting my time?\n\n3. Are there any transferable skills between Fashion Design and software? I can make tech packs and spec sheets, 3D model a dress, draft patterns and textile prints, cut and sew a garment and photograph to sell.. but how do these skills transfer to something like software development? \n\n4. What does it take to get a well-paying job? The people I know in software keep boasting about 110k straight out of college, now that's rare obliviously, what kind of starting salary is reasonable and how does it scale with experience?",

    "body":"Before I ask you to share yours, here's mine (very short) story: I've been at it for 15+ years, started in college by founding a company and creating several of my own IPs (desktop and mobile apps), then switched to having several corporate web development jobs and now want to try myself in business again, however this time I don't want to code, even if it's a software business.\n\nI would find it very interesting to hear the stories of successful former software engineers who founded or co-founded a business and are now operating in a non-technical role.\n\nIn particular, answers to these questions would be very valuable and would help give the answers some structure:\n\n* What business you ended up starting?\n* How did you learn about the field? How long did that take?\n* Was there any catalyst for you to begin on this path?\n* How did you transition from a job to a business?\n* How did you find co-founders (if any)?\n* How did you find customers?\n* How did you get starting capital or was it all savings?\n* How did you hunt for talent (first key employees)?\n* How was your first year compared to expectations?\n* How long did it take to get to a point where you are better off financially and mentally in this new role?\n* What advice would you give yourself if you were just starting out in this business?\n\nThank you to all sharing their stories! I hope they'll inspire and motivate the rest of us.",

    "body":"Hey everyone. I'm a (formerly) lead developer based in the Rust Belt. Have about 12 years experience, skill wise I have had my hands all over the place. My last company went belly up due to the pandemic and earlier this year I started interviewing.\n\nWith remote jobs popping off, a whole new world was opened up for me with job opportunities. I got 5 offers since January. Some gave me close or near my low Rust Belt salary, or the benefits weren't great so I turned them down. Then I got an offer from a mid sized West Coast company (remote).\n\nThe job was for a mid level developer role and their salary was amazing for me, so I took it. But then I took the job and found out that the job itself is way beneath me skills wise.... and I haven't even wrote a single line of code in the 2 months I've been there. So here are my pros and cons:\n\nCons:\n\n- Haven't wrote any code, worried I will stagnate skills wise over time.\n\n- They mislead me, so not exactly hyped about that\n\n- Company is going through a transitionary period, a good number of people have left and been backfilled\n\nPros:\n\n- Pay is WAY more than I can get locally. For reference my friend works in my city as a senior dev and gets $40k less than I do for a tough dev job, while I tweak XML files and other easy stuff. Pay is also more than I got with other remote offers\n\n- Great benefits (unlimited PTO with 20 days minimum encouraged, employee perks, don't have to commute)\n\n- I like my coworkers and they like me\n\n- Low stress. No micromanagement, no one cares what schedule you work, job is a breeze, no panic attacks come deadline time. And best of all, NO DAILY STANDUPS OR SCRUM SHIT!!!\n\nSo I am thinking about just sticking it out for a year. After all the mental stress put on by the pandemic, I feel like I could use a year to work a low stress job and remove myself from the rat race, at least for awhile. However, I am worried that I will stagnate and not interview well in a year. I have no problem getting offers now, and I figure that down the line I can work on my Github and stuff again and get back up to speed.\n\nWhat do you think? Is it worth the risk this far into my career?",

    "body":"Hello, I was hired at the end of March into a ml\/ai risk assessment microservice tech team for a financial institution. I have zero experience in the entire field, I have zero experience in tech in general.  I used to be a chef for a living. I was hired after I finished a coding bootcamp. \n\nThis is my first tech job and the company is aware of this. I have had 6 1on1s with my boss but I feel like I'm not asking the appropriate questions. He hasn't mentioned anything about it but I feel like I'm going to be expected to ask the job related questions now but I fear I still don't really know what it is I'm supposed to be doing. I was told to learn the test automation and be able to do the automation for when we do production release and I've attempted it but I always end up making the test fail and communication with the people in charge of this hasn't really been available and to boot, i think one of the two is on vacation or sick leave at the moment. I'm expected to do a run next Friday.\n\nI've been tasked to learn and I update on my learning. I went to a bootcamp and learned the MERN stack but this company deals with their own proprietary stack so every time I try to learn something I just say .. \"well I learned this and I can see the similarity of this with what is being used in our codebase\" and it seems to be a reasonable explanation to my inability to understand the code thoroughly but I don't know how much longer I can explain that way. \n\nI feel like there's  not much mentorship but I don't know if a month and a half is what they expect to be enough to start on asking more work specific questions and not finding similarities on what I was learning and the codebase that exists already.\n\nSo to my question, what sort of questions can I ask my manager to communicate that I want to be able to understand the codebase but I need some more guidance than what I am receiving now? Basically like 1 to 2 people talking to me a per week and tell me to update my access requests and they will connect with me again later when that's done. When I do get pass that they are busy and can't talk to me again and I'm just left to watching pluralsight videos all day. I'm not complaining, I just feel like I'm still not really learning what I need to learn specifically related to the job and that they will think I will not be good enough for this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the rant.

I love React and in total I have about 3 years of professional React experience.\n\nI bought the JetBrains Hyperskill Java course and while I think it is good for theory, I think personally it is a bad resource for a beginner who doesn't know the right questions to ask. It isn't cutting it for my development.\n\nI'm not in a situation where I must learn Java or I'll get fired, but my motivation to learn it is just not there so I am polling the room on how I can improve my circumstance.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Are there jobs out there that are front-end exclusive that pay $90k+? (My preferred salary - I believe my skills are strong enough to warrant this, but please sound off if you think this is high for my expectations - also NYC area preferably remote). \n\n1a. If these jobs exist, are they rare? (I'm fortunate to have had good references for my previous positions so I don't know this answer from experience.)\n\n2. What resources, even if paid, do you personally think are great for learning Java? I need something else besides Hyperskill and Pluralsight videos but I refuse to do another bootcamp.\n\n3. Am I being a little punk? Or is Java not as bad as I'm making it out to be? Keep in mind my undergrad was in political science but I'm not the weakest in math, but coming from JavaScript, this is just not my cup of tea.\n\nAll opinions welcomed and very appreciated!",

    "body":"I have 3 YOE as a Big Data Engineer at a finance company. I would be joining an MS program in the coming Fall in the US. I am interested in working in the ML domain after graduation. Currently, I have 2 options: the MCDS program at CMU and the MS CS at UCSD. So I have the following 3 questions related to the university and post-grad outcomes:\n\n1. While I heard getting opportunities at FAANG for an ML position are quite difficult, will it help if I take up the specialized Data Science program at CMU? There is also an AI specialization at UCSD. But I am not sure how helpful that would be while looking for an ML position, since the degree still is MS CS.\n2. Is there any compensation difference between people graduating from top-tier universities vs other schools? (or between CMU grad vs UCSD grads, to be specific)\n3. I already have 3 YOE, will I be considered for a new-grad position if I wish to switch to ML from Big Data?\n\nA little background: In my 3 yrs at my current company, I tried multiple times to switch to an ML position, but unsuccessfully. The recruiters that contacted me always offered a data engineer position. Whenever I expressed an interest in working for the ML team, they mentioned I wasn't a good fit. So, it makes me wonder if the situation would still be the same after an MS?",

Whatever I choose would be my first internship experience. \n\nThe crux of the issue is that while the first offer aligns well with my interests, it is with a smaller and less well known company (\\~250 employees). Still has seemingly robust intern program, and there is a good chance I could land a job there after.\n\nThe offer at MITRE involves a larger intern program and company in general, but I do not have as much knowledge about cybersecurity. The subject matter still sounds interesting, and I've been advised that just the name would help me when applying for jobs even though its not in the exact field I was looking into.\n\nAny insight as to which would be a more valuable experience in my position would be much appreciated.

I've been trying to get internship in sophomore year but during Covid a lot of companies canceled the internships so there wasn't any luck.\n\nCollege wasn't exactly helpful because they had to deal with more than half students who didn't manage to find an internship. \n\nManaged to get accepted to the internship but the found out that it's isn't suitable for college requirements. \n\nI'm mostly good at Java and React Native. So there weren't a lot of positions suited for me.\nI've been applying to internships that was available to me. I get passed at CV screening and even do good at the interviews but sometimes I get really anxious at technical questions that I almost forget everything only after the interview I realize  that I could have done so much better answering those questions since then I've been studying questions about algorithms more. \n\nI also get take home assigments but sometimes it's either clashes the college assignment deadline or I have to learn new language and framework to do the assigments. Once I have given assigment to the algorithm that didn't exist (at least when I tried to find mathematical formula of it in scholar.google.com). Other time I managed to complete the assigment and build a Springboot backend but the company replied that I didn't do the requirements that wasn't listed in their task. \n\nPerhaps I wasn't exactly dedicated to the programming as my peers were, since I was also busy with my second hobby? \n\nPrevious semester I've had to take 7 classes (In Lithuania you can't select how many classes per semester you should take) so I didn't have time to built my portfolio though I have college assignments in github but I don't think that's enough. \n\nCurrently I just feel hopelessness and tired. Though I will be applying to more companies before I would have to take an academic leave perhaps then I would have time to make portfolio.\n\nSo far I applied in LinkedIn, Glassdoor and other lithuanian websites that dedicated for internships. \n\nI would like to hear suggestions on where else I could apply to and what else I could work on.\n\nI'd be happy to get an internship that will be accepted by college even the internship will be unpaid and have to learn new language.",

    "body":"Whenever I apply for startups, I typically only look at startups with Series A funding or above to filter out seed startups.  What I realized is that regardless of funding, it does not stop them from having the most unpredictable hiring practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne startup promised me they would consider me for fully remote and that location is not issue for them.  Well, the boomer cofounders decided that they will not be a WFH company, and that they want people in the office at least 4 days a week in the Bay Area.  I decided no thanks, and withdrew my application.\n\n\n\n\n\n6 months ago, I applied for a backend engineering position at one startup.  The recruiter interview went well, then started talking with the hiring manager.  He literally told me that he has zero intention of hiring me for the role in the first minute of the interview, and asked me if I would be willing to interview with them a few months into the future when data-related roles open up.  6 months later, the only job postings this company has is a few account manager jobs.\n\n\n\n\nAnother startup had a lengthy technical interview process.  I did great, but they rejected me because of \"lack of fit\".  Whatever that means, but I typically do well with other companies that have more behavioral interviews.\n\n\n\nWith these hiring practices, it seems like startups will never be able to compete with bigger companies in terms of hiring talent.  There is a lot of people who are willing to work at startups if it meant not doing hundreds of leetcode problems.  I personally would take a very small paycut at my next job if this was possible and if I could work on interesting projects.\n\n\n\n\nStartups with old-fashioned views of WFH will never attract quality engineers if they can't offer WFH to their engineers when they are paying below market value.\n\n\n\n\n\nStartups have the opportunity to attract a lot of talent, but their hiring practices prevent it.",

It feels weird to just sit tight and not tell anyone that you will be leaving, and I feel a bit guilty by waiting to let my managers know until it gets closer to put in my two weeks near the above mentioned start date at the new company. \n\nFor the past two months not a lot of work has been going around, but now I am being put on a new project, furthering my guilt because I know I will be leaving in the next few weeks.  \n\nI have been at my current company (Big non-tech F500) for \\~10 months with it being my first software dev job out of college. The new company is paying me roughly 25% more, more interesting work, plus other perks, and doesn't require me to relocate for work.\n\nOverall I am extremely happy about this move to the new company, although I really do regret not being able to finish at least a year out in my current company as it is my first dev job. \n\nI hear some stories where people give advanced notices greater than 2-weeks and then being let go before that, but also I feel guilty by just holding on while they invest more time in me. \n\nShould I go ahead and just let my current managers know now? Or just hang tight and put in my notice closer towards the start date at the new company and continue on with this last project as if everything is normal?",

    "body":"I'm a resident physician.  I graduated med school last year and will be finishing my first year of residency this summer.\n\nI don't love medicine and the specialty I chose is not going to set me up with a ton of opportunities.  The job market outlook right now is - \"if you're open to moving almost anywhere in the country you'll find a job.  If not, do a 2nd or 3rd fellowship\".  Chances are I'll also be restricted to academia and its salaries.  I'll be making ~60k for the next 3 years and will probably be looking at 150k-200k in 4-5 years, then low 200s several years after that.   Certainly not something to scoff at, but also not the \"doctor money\" some people expect.  Medicine also comes with insurance that will cut into my salary.\n\nI have become increasingly interested in technology and computer programming over the past 5 years.  So much so that I'm considering leaving to become a software engineer.\n\nWould this be absolutely insane?  It wouldn't take much to beat my work satisfaction right now and I already sit in front of a computer all day.\n\nI think my main concerns about making the switch are my ability to make a salary in the same ballpark while having similar benefits (4-6 weeks paid vacation, health insurance) and not being too late to the game to be able to succeed and move up the career ladder.  I'm in my early 30s.\n\nConcerns about staying in medicine are my relative lack of opportunities, the need to move several times in the next several years, and the fact that I just don't like it all that much anymore.   Switching specialities could fix some of this but I think I'd like software engineering more than I'd like any other specialty.\n\nThanks!",

    "body":"Been feeling a little stressed lately, so I thought I'd ask this. Just a general disclaimer first, I'm not discouraging anyone from getting into this field. I'm a young sprout with small experience in this field just venting his frustrations, that's all.\n\nI've been in an IT\/Production Support role for two years. It's been a slog,(long hours, only made worse by the pandemic), coupled with repetitive work. I took night classes and courses to be able to land a job in what I THOUGHT I wanted to do, Software Development.  \n\n\nWell now I left my old IT job and landed this Cloud Development job...and it's more of the same frustrations I had previously. Tight deadlines, long work hours, no one is invested in your career development, hours spent learning a company's business logic to apply numbers to...in other words, another grind. I LIKE working on my personal projects like web apps and games, but I go into work and that love just shuts off completely.   \n\n\nIDK how I should be feeling about this; just wanted to see if anyone has felt anything similar, or if it got better? Maybe it's just the companies\/positions I'm working in? Admittedly, Covid HAS made work culture worse in the companies I work for. I don't have a problem asking for help, but that gets difficult when everyone's busy and I don't have a human being to sit next to. Kind of wanted to hear anyone's thoughts, if it isn't a bother.\n\nI'm juggling the thought of taking a lesser-paying, less stressful job elsewhere, then work on personal projects on my off time. At this point, money isn't an objective for me, sanity is. I just didn't know what kind of reputation it would leave if I just 'took off' from CS jobs for a while.",

I know that short employment times are a terrible thing, but is the fact that I'm still in university a good excuse here? They're not internships, but... ah, I don't know.

The tasks assigned to me by my supervisor feel so out of my league. I had to submit some pretty lousy work and it's making me feel extremely guilty. Just now I had to tell him I really couldn't do one of the tasks he gave to me and I felt like I just hit a new low. \n\nI should be learning and helping out the main team but at this point I feel like I am really slowing them down. A lot of the program I had to write here are done in languages that I have no prior experience with so I had to spend a lot of time just looking up the basics of the programming language itself. I have been skipping lunch these few days just so I can spend more time working but in the end I still end up with some shitty work instead.\n\nSorry for the wall of text that I'm not even sure belongs on this subreddit or not, but I really needed to vent a bit.",

    "body":"Hey guys,\n\nI hope everyone is having a splendid day. I come to you all in need of some feedback and advice in regards to what you believe I may have been doing wrong in my job search process. I graduated last year in August, and have been looking for jobs since September.\n\nFortunately, I was able to secure a few interviews in which I felt that I did well as an Entry Level candidate however, after a few days of each of them, I would wake up to rejection emails suggesting that I did not have enough work experience or, an email directly from the interviewer suggesting that they found a candidate who had at least 1-2 years of experience more than me. \n\nI did two internships during the summer after my sophomore and junior year (2nd went on for 6 months until Covid hit and I got laid off - FML) however, they had a hiring freeze throughout 2020 and I received a rejection that went along the lines of the context I mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\nThroughout the past few months, I've just been depressed after receiving countless rejections, however, I did prepare myself for it, as the times are very difficult due to covid, but the impact of rejections was inevitable as it took a toll on my mental health. \n\nThis past week, I gathered myself and have been putting in the maximum effort towards job search in hopes of success. I have been working in a startup part-time to maintain my visa status as I am an international student which I feel has provided me some valuable experience that I can now bring into my resume. \n\nYesterday, I was considering exploring different paths\/fields with my Computer Science knowledge and experience such as Salesforce Development and Data Analysis but I am a little misguided in regards to them and would appreciate any guidance that anyone may have.\n\nI would also be grateful if you had any feedback or recommendations in regards to how I should up my game in job search and practicing interview questions on leetcode. I am a small Liberal Arts College grad who's looking for any sort of opportunity. Harsh feedback is welcome as well. Thank you for your time!\n\nTL;DR: 2020 Grad still unemployed seeking guidance in job search and exploring other paths.",

I was thinking about telling the new company that and seeing if they would throw in a signing bonus. Does that sound reasonable? And if so how much should I ask for?",

    "body":"Hi everyone,\n\nI currently have a predicament. I can undertake either \n\n1. 1 x unpaid 4 month internship subject (jul-oct), and 1 x paid 3 month internship (dec-feb) or...\n2. 1 x 6 month paid internship (jul-dec)\n3. 3 month internship (dec-feb)\n\nOption 1 is a subject offered by the university and is likely to be undertaken at a startup. Since it's offered by the university, it is legally able to be an unpaid internship. I will likely have to work 3 x per week for 4 months, whilst concurrently completing 3 subjects. After this subject, I will likely have another internship secured over the summer holidays (in Aus) at a reputable company.\n\nOption 2 is basically working full time for 6 months at another reputable company, therefore it will be difficult to study on the side and I will need to defer university by 6 months.\n\nOption 3 is just the 3 month internship from option 1 - is one internship sufficient\/competitive?\n\nWhich would be preferable and increase my chances of getting a good full time job? \n\nIs it worth deferring my graduation for experience?\n\nThank you!",

I have a few projects in my portfolio, but if I'm going to be completely honest I feel as though my skill level is very much internship level. Nevertheless, I hate my job and the CS job hunt for internships has been  rough. I'm getting desperate as I want to quit my job and get into the field soon. So I have put together a few options and I would like to get some opinions as to which course of action I should take:\n\n1. Programming Bootcamp (will have to be remote due to my location)- Pros: Networking, certification, refine my skills, access to teachers for questions, they will likely improve my chances of getting hired at a high paying job. Cons: Expensive, lengthy, no guarantee of job quickly, I will have to put up with my current job for about another year.\n2. Unpaid Internship- Pros: Networking, experience with interviews, work experience to put on a resume, real experience with programming within an organization, access to higher level devs for questions, I could possibly graduate to a paid position? Cons: Unpaid, no guarantee of graduating to paid position, experience on resume still may not be enough for future job hunt.\n\nWhat do, frens?",

I also get excellent benefits and healthcare. This offer sounds great except for the fact that it is a rotational program and it requires me to relocated to Kennesaw, GA first and then Charlotte, NC or Seattle, WA. The job is an application development in C++ and C#, or implement REST based APIs in a service-based architecture. This doesn\u2019t sound bad, but I currently work as a software engineer\/(mobile developer) at a small company in Tampa, FL. I love my current job because I get to work as the main mobile developer\/engineer which it amazing giving that is my first job and mobile development is the field that I always wanted to be in since before graduating from college. This job gives me a lot of freedom, so much that for the past 4 months I been working remotely from Puerto Rico and my boss is pretty easy going with how I organize my daily work schedule. Unfortunately, my currently salary is below average even for a job located in FL. My salary is 55k, but I have been living very comfortably because I don\u2019t need to pay rent in Puerto Rico and the cost of living here is significantly lower than in Tampa, FL. My dilemma is, should I take this new job offer and leave my current job? I made a cost analysis of all the expenses I would inquire if I accept this new job offer and my net gains after all expenses is only like $400 more than what I\u2019m currently making\/saving on a monthly basis. All my family and friends are either in Puerto Rico or Tampa so GA would be apart from all of them and I not sure the extra money is worth moving apart from all of them, but I don\u2019t know if I should let this opportunity slip away since the salary is so high. Should I mention the offer to my current employer and ask if they would at least give me a 10k increase on my salary? I have only been working for my current employer for four months so I\u2019m relatively new. Also, is me not taking this job offer limiting my chances of getting an even higher salary in the future? Should I stick to mobile development if I'm enjoying it so much? What is the best course of action for someone in my position?",

The TC is pretty good for a Canadian new grad position and it is a company I would enjoy working for and has good learning and growth opportunities. \n\nHowever, the TC does not compare to that of high tier US tech companies, and is also less than that which the US offices for this company offers.

I've been feeling very much like I needed to go elsewhere for a while but I haven't had a good push as the job pays OK and offers great benefits (but with 0 upward mobility).\n\nHowever, last week I had a medical incident and at this point I'm not sure if I'll be able to safely drive as much (if at all), even going up and down stairs can be a challenge. I'm on medical leave from work while waiting on specialists and referrals etc. but I'm coming from an IT job that involved a large amount of walking.

The one I see most advertised\/recommended is App Authority, but there's literally no way to schedule a talk with admissions (which seems really suspicious). They claim you pay nothing upfront until you \"find a job\" making $50k+, but they don't specify that it's a software engineer job.

What are other things I can learn on my own that will actually help me get a job? Things that might not be taught in a comp sci program. I just really need guidance.",

Just talking to her I could tell she was quick, conscientious, and would learn fast, but she doesn't know current frameworks in depth. (For reference, she learned COBOL in college.) She's also looking for flexible or part-time hours, so that she can be home for her kids. She'd be happy to do a trial period or internship first. \n\nI think there are a lot of companies that would like to hire people like this - not FAANG perhaps, but smaller companies who would want someone smart and with life experience, and are willing to train a new employee in their specific technologies.

The pay would be $50\/hour, and is about 30% more than I make now. I want to take it, but my gut is telling me no. \n\nTo start off, I think the firm outsourced to India which isn't bad, but the recruiter or HR rep don't understand verbal english. So phone conversations go nowhere. The second red flag was when the recruiter lied about me getting the position and started asking for my social. I reached out straight to my interviewer and he said he didn't make a decision yet. Also when I asked the recruiter if I'd have insurance, can take time off, he said yes to all of it. Yet the paperwork from HR listed my position as a computer programmer (all docusign btw, no workday for onboarding) without insurance. \n\nI told them when I have proof from Walmart I got the position I'll fill out the paperwork. Finally this week a person who is english proficient reached out and sent an email screenshot of Walmart confirming to move forward with me. I reached out to the interviewer from Walmart to discuss long term career expectations to make sure this purely a 6 month contract and we chat tomorrow. \n\nSo I feel trapped between a rock and a hard place. I would love the opportunity and experience working somewhere like Walmart could offer (it's supply chain tech), however I am STRESSED about having anything to do with Saicon. There are SO many red flags I'm questioning if it's even worth the risk. Has anyone heard or worked with Saicon? What would you do in my position or if you've been in a similar experience would you advise?",

    "title":"Counter Offer Advice",
    "body":"Hello,\n\nFirst Reddit post in a long time!\n\nStory time: I am an engineering student, I have an associates in manufacturing engineering. Currently going for my bachelors. I have been a machinist for 5 years, minus 6 months where I was a tooling engineer before being demoted due to the pandemic. Shortly after I followed a coworker to a different company as it was made clear that my engineering position was being eliminated even after business picked up.\n\nI recently was reached out to by a friend who's small shop was looking for another manufacturing engineer. The place offered me the position with no raise (I am paid very well for a machinist, I produce excellent results), and the benefits are not as good seeing as it is a much smaller shop then the one I work at. However, the way I see it is that engineering experience will help my engineering career in the long run compared to more machining experience. (It's not really a field that can be peaked, but I feel like anything else I learn would only be useful if I stayed being a machinist).\n\nSo with that job offer in hand, I gave my notice at my current job. Immediately upon doing so I was told to talk to the plant manager and explain the situation. I did so, while explaining that the company had treated me excellently, and that I was not leaving due to an increase in pay but rather more suitable work experience.\n\nI was made a counter offer which will be given to me in writing on monday that states something to the following effect: I will become an associate manufacturing engineer, the company will reimburse the next 2 years of my tuition and upon completion I will be promoted to manufacturing engineer. However the duties of associate manufacturing engineer will not start for a few months while they free someone up to operate my machines.\n\nIn the machining\/manufacturing world, it's completely normal for things to take a bit because skilled labor is hard to come by (especially now, given the current job market). I also did not find any reason to doubt the legitimacy of his want for me to fill this position. There is a lifetime employee\/engineer retiring in a year or 2, and the other engineers have purchased tooling that has made me want to bang my head into a wall, causing real issues in the shop. I was a tooling engineer at one point, so there have been times I have told them things weren't going to work before even producing parts. (so far, I've won that argument every time after they try it anyways.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my question with that all out of the way is: should I consider the counter offer? I have always heard they are bad to accept. However I do enjoy my current company, I just want to start my engineering career and start to leave my machining one behind. If I were to accept the counter offer, what sorts of things should I look for in the written offer to be safe?",

I became incredibly depressed and basically couldn't be bothered to finish my classes even though I basically just had to open and take the final ( I was so miserable and shameful of myself I thought I deserved to fail even if I could pass).

I miraculously went back and my financial aid was miraculously given back as well at the sympathy of a counselor. I started to feel better around the fall, and somehow luckily I got a job around December at a very reputable company for xx engineering with a great program. The thing is the mental health issues left me barely scraping by as I wasn't properly able to be productive and got basically all D's in all my classes which was fine for graduating I suppose, but I'm nearing the end of spring semester and the classes I have exams for I could cram and take, but my very very last cs class in circuitry was asynchronous and I basically didn't even look at it doing half the assignments, missed all quizzes and lab attendance grade, and the final is in a week. I'm confident in my ability to do well on the final tbh, but even then it looks like I won't be able to pass the class.\n\nMy job is set to start in mid June, and I don't think I'll ever be lucky enough to receive an offer as amazing as this job in the current job climate and in general. It's basically 100k salary w amazing benefits and opportunities at a top 50 company. I can't take this class in the summer as it's not offered either. I emailed the professor recently and he said he's a little sympathetic but unless I get a doctor's note for some assignments, he is being strict with all his deadlines and giving 0's a minute late grading policy. I really don't know what to do and I've heard of people taking jobs and not saying anything which tbh seems possible in this case, but I also am afraid of the risks of that backfiring and sorta disappointed having done the work for 2 majors and not getting a degree. I really haven't told anyone about this as my peers are so happy for me, but graduation is in a few weeks (luckily optional so I don't have to tell family) and it's eating at me inside. Only in the last few weeks I've started to get my shit together from the support of a few incredible supportive people to recover my other classes but this one class seems unsalvageable.\n\nWhat should I even do? My friends family and relatives are all expecting me to graduate with this job. Should I just start the job and not look back? Or do I tell my company, lose the opportunity, and take another semester in the fall to graduate (if my university even lets me attend again after failing so many classes). It's so stupid that I did this to myself especially when looking back all I had to do was the bare minimum, but I also can't forget how debilitating the shame and depression that I went through lead me here. If I start my job too, I think I'm really confident that I will do really well. I have no idea what to do I just need to hear opinions.",

I started my career as a .Net developer circa 2011. I worked primarily as a PHP developer for a few years after that. I was voluntold to be a full stack developer at a job about 6 years back where I picked up JavaScript and started working on SPAs and so on.\n\nI'm definitely at the point where I **should** be a competent senior developer. I find that I am always just beneath the capabilities of the role. At the same time, I am very much not a junior developer.\n\n----\n\n**So**, what do I mean beneath the role? I find that I am consistently just beneath the mark in areas here, and related to these:\n\n* Time to grok a new technology or component of code.\n\n  * Sometimes thing instantly click but it feels like I am working twice or three times as hard as to what I see other developers express.\n\n* Sprint Velocity is nearly always a few points from the mark.\n\n* How to question. When in almost any situation (technical and not) I struggle to come up with relevant questions.\n\n  * I think this is in part related to my ability to articulate my thoughts concisely? Definitely a soft skill that compounds other issues. \n\n----\n\nWhat are some ways that you have, or are, leveling up your skill set in these weird in between phase?\n\nI try to watch conference talks, keep my eye here for threads, other subreddits, try to ask questions to my peers at work, and that sort of thing.\n\n--\n\nEDIT: Hopefully that's a bit more concise and actionable.

    "title":"What (entry-level) jobs do I even qualify for with my mish-mash of software and analysis experience?",
    "body":"I'm a recent graduate from a CS program in Canada looking to land my first full-time job in software development. My problem mainly stems from the fact that I feel that I don't really have the skills that most companies are looking for due to some off-kilter experience.\n\nAs for why that is: I actually did a dual degree in Computer Science and Engineering Physics (EP first, then started CS in 3rd year). This was partially because EP has few job prospects unless you're going into research or are gung-ho about space (which I am not), and partially because I wanted to get an internship through the CS department's internship program (which worked out, thankfully). Throughout these degrees, my accumulated experience amounts to 3 summers of research writing data analysis code for radar and satellite data (with 2 papers published with co-author credits) and a 16-month internship writing image analysis code for a university group that was half research group and half startup company (its weird). As for projects, I was focused on my classes, so my projects mainly stem from them: a Python simulator to recreate the results of a networking paper, a mechanical device for rotating tiny samples in a vacuum chamber (for the EP degree's final-year project), and other small things that recruiters likely wouldn't care about like a dead-simple stepper motor driver.\n\nAs a result, I don't seem to mesh well with most entry-level software development positions. I don't have any web-dev experience, whether front, back, or full-stack (despite the image analysis code being made for a web-app; I just didn't write much non-analysis stuff for the backend codebase, which was mostly Python, Django, and an abuse of ElasticSearch as a database). Embedded and IOT stuff seem interesting to me, but they seem to require hardcore C\/C++ experience that I don't have plus a bunch of other weird skills that I've not have encountered before. Cloud and database stuff is also interesting, but they similarly have high requirements that I can't really meet. It seems that all I could really do is data analysis, but I'd much rather be a software developer and not be pigeonholed into just analysis, even with substantial coding involved.\n\nAnd so, I haven't applied to as many places as I should have so far. I've gotten 1 interview, but only because a friend of a friend (\/my supervisor for my internship) gave me a referral to a popular local company with Master's level AI people also applying to it. I just don't know what positions I qualify for or should apply to. I don't know how I can convince recruiters and companies that I could easily learn and do embedded, or cloud, or web development with what is largely analysis experience. I don't know how I can spin my mish-mash of experience into a full-time software development position.\n\n(And, for posterity, [my current resume](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/TSLvJWt), though critiques are not the point of this post compared to the worries I mentioned above.)",

    "body":"I have a bachelor's In CS. Graduated 3 years ago. I fell in love ML that I did my thesis on that topic. Felt frustrated during the process as I had many questions I cannot answer that were specific to my problem. My professor suggested I do an MS in CS with a focus on ML. Had to work right after grad because can't afford to enroll myself yet. During my working years, I met a really smart group of people who believed that an MS is a waste of time and money if you wanna work for businesses. These group had lots of connections which brought me lots of part time data science related gigs = $$$. With that money I've saved, I'm planning to study part time(I already applied and got accepted to the best uni that offers this degree in my country and under the ML lab of a great supervisor) and work full time. I can't quit my job because I need to support my family financially.\n\nI think I need more time in school aka MS degree because in my work as a data scientist for a startup, Ive been in situations where I failed to understand what to change in a ready made tool so it will work for my client's specific problem. These are open source tools for deep learning. I don't know if experience alone can fix this under the hood problem.\n\nI also did not understand the material perfectly well in theory classes back in college. I believe a formal training will sharpen my skills in reading ML papers and implement them to code. Plus, I got rejected from a machine learning research scientist position I applied because someone with an MS degree was preferred by the company. \n\nOther than that realization in my limitation of understanding, I don't know other possible motivations to get an MS in CS with ML focus degree. Hoping you could give my some guidance. Thank you. \n\n\n\nP. S\nI'm from a third world country where AI\/ML is not yet booming.",

I'm going to be an undergrad junior in the fall, but I can't take upper levels til next winter because I only started CS coursework last Fall (premed freshman year). I have an internship with cybersecurity at a non-tech company (with a tech internship program)  this summer, but I got to final interview with a FAANG company earlier this year (but bombed it because I got a question on binary trees, at which point I hadn't even learned about pointers or linked lists). After that rejection, I kept looking for other positions but didn't hear back at all (so maybe the FAANG interview process was a fluke). Outside of classwork and a computational bio internship, I don't have any experience with software dev, and I have no clue what Dev\/Ops or Full Stack or Front\/Back end even means (though I think I could just google that lol). I just feel like a tiny fish in a huge pond.\n\nI know C++ a good amount (that's what my classes are taught in) and at my current job I use Python. I learned Java in high school and I can use R for statistical programming. What additional skills should I develop? Are there are any project ideas that I could take on over the summer (couple hours on weekends\/after work)  that will make my resume stand out and my portfolio less barren? I want the internship search to be different next summer, and I want to go in feeling confident that I'll breeze past the initial resume reviews. If it matters, my CS gpa atm is pretty good, but I've heard gpa doesn't really matter for internships but I really don't know lol.",

    "body":"I have nowhere else to rant so I wanted to post here to get people's opinion. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this way knowing how lucky I am to have a job and a company that has treated me well but oh well.  Over the past 2-3 months, I've started to feel very upset and angry at my work due to small little things adding up to a point I can't just ignore and I want to share with everyone to see if anyone else has experienced these. I feel like I'm being a soft azz beach but I just can't tell why it upsets me so much.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. In our team calls where we are discussing new features and details, I feel like I don't get the chance to say what I want to say. One senior starts talking about something, UX jumps in to point flaws and then it just becomes a back and forth back and forth between these two with others jumping in and cutting each other off to speak and I'm just not like that. Ill politely raise my hand and wait until my manager calls but because these guys keep going back and forth and my manager doesn't shut them up, it gets to the end of the meeting and I either forgot what I wanted to say or no more time and the meeting ends with my opinions and thoughts not expressed. Like there have been times I wanna unmute and just yell \"CAN EVERYONE PLEASE SHUT UP AND LET ME SPEAK!\" but that's obviously unprofessional and I hate cutting people off mid conversation to assert my point. It happened several times and I just feel like nobody gives a shit about what I need to say. The seniors dominate the conversation and UX guy can't just shut the up for a God damn second and keeps pushing back while I sit there politely waiting for my turn. At the beginning I just ignored it and said it's fine but it happened so much that now I just feel like crying and feel useless to the company cause nobody apparently cares about what I want to say. The couple times I have had the chance to express my views regardless how dumb they are, I appreciated just being acknowledged and being told that it's not a good idea or it's a great idea. I'm not always right but I literally just want to be acknowledged and heard when I have something.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. One time some guy from another team was having trouble with something he was working on and it was connected to something I worked on before. I help him troubleshoot and spend my entire day looking beyond our code and into the packages we are using (went beyond our codebase, a deeper rooted issue). Once I found out why, I was excited since it took me the whole damn day. He's much more senior than I am so I was really excited to report to him the problem. Once I did, he was just like \"oh that's wrong it shouldn't be like that\" end of conversation. No thank you, no appreciation for debugging for him, no F'ING NOTHING! I was so deflated cause I literally could have denied to help him but because he's much more senior and has way more experience, I felt rude rejecting his request although I had my own work.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n 3. Manager assigned me a feature that I should work on. I was super excited and he helped give me get started. I start digging into it, researching it, spending my personal time outside work cause I was just that invested. Mid way through, he tells me he will look into it too. He ends up hijacking it and finishing it using some of the work I had done ... Again I felt upset. Why do all that when you were gonna end up working and finishing it. Wtf??? Was I taking too long? Could you have not just directed me to get it done the way you wanted?   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways these are some examples that come to mind and I've gotten to a point where I just drag myself to work. I can't tell if it's valid to feel upset and hurt cause the company has been otherwise treating me well and my manager most of the times is cool and understanding but I can't help understand why I'm so frustrated and upset when I do work. Everyone else in the company seems to be at harmony. Nobody else seems to have trouble with one another. Why do I feel the outlier? Why do I feel so upset and angry at people? I'm so confused .... I cannot reason my emotions. I shouldn't feel this way I have work at a time many people don't and I'm getting paid well but why am I so upset and frustrated with people??",

    "body":"I've always seen people here posting about how burnt out they get applying for jobs over the course of a month, etc, etc. Before I used to just chuckle to myself, now I understand the burn out.\n\nOver the last 3 weeks I've begun to hunt for a junior developer position to get out of my database engineering role (we all know how terribly dry databases are). \n\nI've applied to over 100 positions on Indeed (I only focus on the ones I can apply directly through indeed with), and I have had pretty decent success getting HR screenings, hiring manager interviews, and finally this week the technical interviews.\n\nThis process though is so draining. You commit so much time to these interviews (usually 20-30 mins just for HR screening), and often times you just get ghosted. You have to put on your most friendly face and attitude while interviewing just to make it to the 2nd or 3rd round to either get ghosted, or get a rejection.\n\nHonestly if I don't receive well enough offers within the next week or two I may just call it quits for now. I don't think I have it in me to restart the entire process with 5-10 companies again. \n\nFor those of you out there going through similar situation trying to just get your first job, hang in there and just keep grinding away at applying and interviewing. I know it's mentally exhausting and tiring but hang in there.",

Initially I thought about getting another 1099 job because I have the bandwidth for it but then I feel like maybe I'm stretching myself too thin and going in the wrong direction. So another thought I had was to go on these sites that offer developers for hire and vet them myself and then turn around and apply for jobs that allow third party applicants. The developer would then be handed over as a consultant to work on the project for the client. There would be no project management on my side. They would simply be a supplemental resource added to a client project. I would build a higher hourly rate and take a cut off the top of it.\n\nWhat am I missing here? This sounds kind of easy especially since I can talk the lingo of tech because I am a developer. It feels like this would scale better than continuing to do 1099 work myself. I'm just not familiar with all of the processes and procedures of subcontracting a 1099 person to another client. it doesn't appear like there is a lot of information online about this from what I have seen.

    "title":"How do I handle the feeling that I'm not learning much at my current position?",
    "body":"I work at a large firm, and the pay is decent, though about just over half of what my friends make. This is my first job, gonna complete an year next month, right out of university - I did my internship here too. I'm working in a split model, where I offer technical support, and handle tickets for the better part of three days, and then I develop tools to support this team in the remaining two. Most of my active development deals with AngularJS and Java 8\/Spring.\n\nI wasn't interested in the support part at all, but I decided to continue with the job because I was afraid of the job market during the pandemic. I have continued to dislike it, but I have learnt how to better manage my time due to it. I also decided to think of it as the \"[eating my own dog food](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eating_your_own_dog_food)\".\n\nLately, I've gotten extremely frustrated because of the kind of code I'm exposed to. This team completely makes internal products, so we have next to no \"good code\". I have worked with better code than this in my second year of university. It ranges from ridiculous architectural designs, to unit tests that are written purely for the sake of it (think mocks an input and verifies that the input is mocked), and just zero handling of technical debt whatsoever.\n\nI have toyed with the idea of shifting to a different team that does work on consumer-facing products, considering I love the firm I'm at but that seems to be unlikely because our support team is currently in the middle of a resource crunch. What do I do now? Should I consider a new job? Has anyone else been in the same position here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'm also helping out interns who joined us this year. A common thing I've heard from the seniors is that \"its fine if they can't code well, its the easiest part of the job\". This has particularly irked me because I kinda agree with it, but this is clearly where the bad code stems from.",

I'm not gonna be helping applying all that but I just want to help her with a list of options or choices because I really wanna help her get off the ground. We live in the Orange County, California area and so far any LinkedIn, Indeed, or glassdoor searches have yielded pretty much nothing. I'm at a complete lost now on where to look and I've been hitting up connections anywhere I could. Could anyone please advise on what I can do and where can I look specifically?",

    "title":"Tentatively Offered a Job. Next Comes Vetting. Some questions",
    "body":"Here's the short version of where I am in a hiring process. Skip to the tldr for the relevant question in bold:\n\nApplied for a job I wasn't qualified for (by accident), surprisingly, they still wanted to interview me. \n\nI did well in the first interview, was asked to do a second one with the team I'd be working with. That also went well. \n\nHad a 15 minute zoom call with the hiring manager (from the first interview), he wants to hire me, but (as described above) I'm not qualified for the position I applied for, but he wants to hire me for a position that's being created currently (already submitted to hr, they're doing approval before its posted). Told me it SHOULD take 1-2 weeks, but knowing hr, make that a month. \n\nHe told me I might consider doing a temp position in the mean time, but only if Hr could guarantee a smooth transition to the full time position. After about a week, hr could not give him the assurances he wanted, so he took the temp thing off the table and said we'd wait for the full time position.\n\nGot an update friday, they're negotiating the salary with hr now. Got another update this morning: position passed the first step of the approval process, he expects the job to (hopefully) \"post\" this week. He'll then move my application to that newly created position where he'll then tell hr he wants to hire me for that position. \n\n**I then asked what step comes next. He said hr will do their vetting of me, then they'll formally extend me the offer. He said the vetting will be normal stuff like checking references and my education. I have the bachelor's degree in computer science that is required for this entry level position, but I'm worried about my gpa. While i didn't see anything about gpa requirements, my college gpa was pretty shit (under a 3.0) because I switched majors yata yata yata. I've heard from a friend who's a software engineer at an insurance company, that she's had people get hired by the hiring manager, and then upon hr reviewing their application, denied the hire because of their gpa. I don't know how typical that is though. Couple questions then. First, how common is it for people to check your gpa (rather than just verify that you do in fact possess the required degree). Of the 4-5 places i've gotten interviews with the last year (fuck covid man, so many places are in a hiring freeze, if not outright laying people off), only one has requested my transcripts. Obviously I didn't get that job. And my second question, how common is it for places to then reject you if your gpa isn't above a certain threshold? I mean its not like its beneath a 2.0 or anything. its just not above 3.0. If i were to just give them my gpa for the last 2.5 years (5 semester) when i formally switched majors to computer science, my gpa is a 3.06. I think that's a lot more relevant to my skills than to look at my long gpa history when I was in a completely unrelated major.**\n\ndon't sugar coat it for me. This is the first time since i graduated last may that a company was actually interested in hiring me. Its a large university hiring for biomedical research they do. I'd hate to finally have a tentative offer only to have hr give the thumbs down. If my hiring manager (whom i've built a rapport with) is emphatic enough, could he sway them? \n\nThanks as always guys",

    "body":"Hello everyone!\n\nI am graduating from a Computer Science degree in 2023. I have been fortunate enough to work a summer internship as a full-stack developer utilizing React and Node.JS (typescript for both) as well as a year long internship working as a system developer using Java (no frameworks AFAIK). I also have a lot of AI experience through clubs using Python but I am not really a big fan of working with ML\/AI, still worth mentioning since I believe Django has a decent market share for backend.\n\nI am trying to make myself as attractive a candidate as possible through bolstering my personal portfolio. I have two projects on it thus far, both of which have used React and Node.JS. I am hoping to have a couple more full stack side projects by the time I graduate, on top of having my AWS certifications and enhancing my side projects with their services. \n\nI was wondering if you guys think it would be worth creating projects in C#\/Java since currently I am hoping to work primarily in backend as this is the field I have found most compelling so far. Those two languages obviously dominate the backend job market currently but it seems like overkill to use these for projects that aren't of enterprise scale, in addition to having a higher learning curve than other languages and frameworks. I really like working with Node.JS and am quite comfortable throwing servers together with Express. I also have demonstrable work experience with Java thanks to my current internship even though it is not in a traditional web development setting. Ultimately, do you guys think it would be worth it to teach myself Java or C# for the backend of future side projects or would it be better to gain more experience with Node.JS? If so, should I bolster my Java knowledge or jump into C# which seems to be a much more developer friendly experience? Job market seems evenly split in my area.\n\nTL;DR, upcoming CS graduate can't decide if I should continue making side projects with Node.JS or branch off and learn Java\/C# to prepare me for enterprise jobs",

I know SCRUM master is often a full-time job, but he said he doesn't expect me to do much more than go to the same meetings I'm going to now, like retro, standup, etc.  This is what he's been doing in the same position, so I believe him.\n\nIf I say yes, it'll come with a pay bump, although he hasn't given me a number yet. I'd also get to go to a SCRUM master training course, and I have no doubt he'd be very supportive.  I've been filling in for him from time to time, and I enjoy it.\n\nMy main goal is to grow my SW career, and this seems like it could be a good way to develop soft skills that will benefit me there. But I wouldn't want it to pull me away or detract from my primary focus of software engineering. I do, however, see how they could be complementary.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

I probably dont fundamentally understand how this works, but how are you able to make $Y amount off of the stocks you are given each year? Dont you have to sell the stock to make money? If you are given a certain amount of stocks when you join, how are you able to keep generating that $Y amount of money each year if you have to sell the stocks to get the money?\n\nAnd how often do people actually get the liquid cash from these stocks? Are you actually cashing in $Y throughout the year? Or is it just sitting there gaining money over time depending on how the company is doing, but no one really touches it until they leave the company\/retire?\n\nI know absolutely nothing about stocks btw if that isnt obvious, so please bear with me.",

    "body":"I don't know how to say it, I go to UBC (top 3 cs\/ce school in Canada) Computer Engineering, have almost perfect major GPA (4.0 major, 3.3 cgpa, rough Canadian GPA to us gpa conversion, Dean's honor list, and according to my advisor I would be top 5% of my faculty this year based on my academic performance this semester), have 1 year of coop work experience in web and mobile app dev, have projects, and yet here I am, not securing anything. For my second coop work term (Jan 2019), I only had 4 months of work experience, did like 50 applications, got 7-8 interviews and multiple offers. Now with that coop work term experience, I did almost 500 applications, over 10-12 interviews and no offer so far. I have done a lot of mock interviews, did 130 leetcode problems, had referrals, and had really good interviews but it seems like it is almost impossible to get an internship now. My friends who work at FAANG and with whom I practiced Mock, told me that the best way to approach a problem is to give them a suboptimal solution, then work with your interviewer to give an optimal solution, and even if you can't, if you share your thought process, they will take you in (one of my friend couldn't solve a faang problem but talked out his thought process and got the job at that same company). Seems like it is no longer the case. Interviewers want an optimal solution at the first try, and if I work with them, I just get rejected. I recently had an interview with SAP where they gave me 2 problems, i gave them optimal for the one and suboptimal for the second one and my interviewer told me I did really well, and I was really good at communicating my thought process, yet I got rejected.\n\nI really am feeling extremely burnt out and tired. if this is the norm, how can I even break into the industry? My high gpa that I worked really hard for, my interview prep that I spent hours after hours with my friends, spending time on my resume, countless mock interviews with coop office, paid service and with my friends, all are just going to waste. I am not only tired and concerned that maybe I should not be in the field in the first place. My other engineering friends even in this job market didn't have to go through that many interviews, and some coop programs (especially civil, mining and geotechnical) have almost 100% placement rate (meaning almost everyone who was in the coop program secured a work term this summer)\n\nI don't know, I chose software engineering because I really loved making small web and mobile apps, and always wanted to know how video games work, but it is really burning me out right now with all this interview prep and the disappointment I am getting after getting rejected even though I felt I did really well. It's endless cycle of rejections. I really want some advice as to what should I be doing next? Switching to some other engineering field? Go to grad school? Just give up? I am also really concerned as to whether I even have a chance to break into the career if this is the stage of internship interview, then new grad is almost next to impossible.\n\nAlso just to clarify, I am applying to everything, not just big name companies. Most of them are local with a few in other Canadian provinces and a few to US companies. \n\nThanks",

    "body":"I got fired from a startup in just under 2 months. To be honest I'm relieved. I think I got put on a performance improvement plan on my third week, and the feedback I got from my manager didn't always make sense. I didn't have framework experience although my manager thought he heard I did in the interview, so my output was low while I was learning things and this was brought up on week 3. Not sure if framework experience was a hiring requirement but it seems most devs they hire have it. I started working harder and my performance improved, yet I was told \"I don't think you understand what's happening at the company\" after I crushed a sprint they claimed I wasn't expected to finish. I asked for very little help during this sprint which is why I'm confused he'd bring up my understanding. When performance wasn't an issue they brought up miscommunications (which had almost no impact) without commending my performance improvement, and on my first slow week after improving they fired me lol. I'm pretty sure my manager made up his mind on week 3.\n\nMoving forward, do you think I should bother including this job on my resume at all? I took a year-long personal break from my career prior to joining this company, so I'm both anxious to fill that gap but not so worried about an extra 2 months off. I don't know if 2 months of experience outweighs the negatives of being fired in the eyes of recruiters and interviewers.\n\nTo be honest I've had performance issues after a year at a big tech company before this, but I've been working through what I think my problems are and I think I still belong as a dev, even if at a non IT company.",

    "body":"Hi all, thanks for reading and helping me out. I've been at Microsoft  for 2.5 years as a PM for a couple teams. I've been working here since graduation and have an EE degree with a minor in CS. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to code or do many 'technical' projects while on these teams and don't have any internship experience, so I'm considering myself as having 'zero-experience' although that's not completely true. I would like to switch roles to software engineering as I think this position better aligns with my interests and provides an opportunity to gain more useful and tangible skills. I have a couple questions I hope folks could help me with:\n\n1. [I saw this older post from the FAQ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/6e0dm4\/are_remote_entry_level_positions_rare\/) about finding entry level remote positions, and how rare it is. Now that we've been working from home for the last year I imagine (or hope) that there would be more opportunities for entry level remote work? If that's the case, any advice on where to look? If not remote, what would be the best listings to find entry-level positions?\n2. It will be easiest for me to pivot internally but am interested in exploring other companies. I'm not sure if being at Microsoft is a better help considering my role but, is there anything you think I could do to better my chances of switching companies (beyond \"doing side projects\")?\n3. I'm currently going through CTCI and attempting a couple LeetCode problems a day (studying Java). My coding experience is limited to Java and C which I studied in school. I know that lots of companies use more modern languages such as React, TypeScript, etc. Is it necessary for me to learn these to standout as 'relevant' (such as taking a bootcamp course, or doing a side project in these languages)?  I know \"anything helps\" but 'm trying to optimize my studying since I have a full-time job.\n\nI may need some help deciding on whether to pivot companies or try to move internally (and then pivot) but would like to start here.

For reasons I don't want to get into, I decided that's not the path I want to take, I want to just do programming full-time. I do a little bit of SQL and Python at work, but not enough to satisfy me, or tell interviewers that I did proper software development in those languages, mostly bug fixes and scripting.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't have any real internships, I just volunteered on-and-off for about a year and a half on a website my friend made, it was C#, MS SQL, and Bootstrap. I wrote maybe like 10 web pages of varying complexity, with a lot of guidance from my friend. My friend stopped doing the website several months ago and I can't really carry it on, I don't have the permission or expertise, as he pretty much told me what to write and only I understood some (but not all) of it, though towards the end I was getting more independent. \n\nThe C# stack my friend used is pretty old, I really don't see many jobs requiring any of the front-end stuff we used; it's all react\/angular and typescript\/javascript now from what I'm seeing. In the few technical interviews I've made it to, they're surprised\/disappointed I don't know REST, MVC, or Javascript. The jobs I'm applying for I can usually do fine in the interviews and pass the (easy) coding assessment, I just don't think I tick the boxes for recruiters or hiring managers because my stack isn't really common anymore.\n\nAs all my C# experience sorta ended several months ago, I'm really rusty on remembering how certain things worked and my friend really isn't available to help me with that stuff. Unfortunately for me, this seems like the best life line I have on my resume to hop over to software development.\n\nAre there any options I have other than just spending all my free time forcing myself to learn javascript\/typescript\/angular\/rest, or will the right opportunity come along eventually? I don't really care if I'm front-end or back-end, I just want a job and obviously the least amount of extra work I have to do after working 40+ hours a week would be nice. Are there other things I should prioritize learning instead? And just as a note, I'm not trying to get into a FAANG here, just any old job would be cool.\n\n**tl;dr - Only real experience other than my cs degree was some volunteering on a website where I was guided through everything by a more senior dev. The site used an older stack that didn't use javascript\/typescript\/react\/angular\/REST\/etc. so I was wondering if I had to learn those to get an entry-level job. What do I need to do?**",

You people are working yourselves and others up over something that doesn't actually matter.\n\nI've been in the industry for 10 years now. I don't have a college degree and I never went to a bootcamp. I've had about 6 jobs in the industry so far. I've been everything from a junior dev, to a mid dev, to a senior dev, to a team lead. I've worked for small mom and pop companies and I've worked for F500 companies. I've never used leetcode before.

What I do care about when hiring people is their personality and their ability to solve **actual** problems that actual businesses have gone through.\n\nMy point is, leetcode isn't the end all be all to getting a job in the industry. 90% of companies could not care less about it. Focus more on being an easy person to work with and work on actual interesting personal projects and I guarantee you'll get a job faster than someone who's spending 100% of their time doing problems on leetcode that they'll never have to use in the real world.",

    "body":"Before covid (Summer 2019?) I had posted this:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/dflwh8\/salary_negotiation_question\/\n\nSo after I posted this I was pretty persistent about my promotion with my manager.  Because I was designing the system rewrite from the ground up, I believed I satisfied the SWE III requirements.\n\nMy manager didn't really agree, which was really disappointing, and he seemed to be ambivalent about the whole situation.  He didn't understand that my promotion had to be put in before a certain date and missed it.  This was January 2020.\n\nAt that point I escalated it two levels up and had a one on one with the manager of all software engineering for my company.  He was definitely more receptive but was also trying to make the point that I was \"silo'ed\" and needed to do more stuff to get my work noticed.\n\nCoincidentally a month later we had a huge project come in with an incredibly aggressive timeline.  I was able to shift gears quickly and help complete the project, being a fundamental part of it.  This brought us up into March of 2020. \n\nThen COVID hit and I was told that I was SOL and come back in 3-6 months.  That sucked a lot especially since I had busted my ass for a huge company win.  I basically went on cruise control for the next several months, and kept inquiring about my promotion once the 3 month mark had passed.  I started looking for new employment during the summer, just passively and when I had time.  I had probably a dozen interviews over the past year to varying levels of success, some I got really close to closing.\n\nMy manager kept checking and the answer was always no.  As fall and winter rolled around I started nagging more about it.  It was pretty rough, on one end you have corporate saying \"there is no hiring freeze\" but then your manager saying \"all adjustments are on hold.\"  \n\nI had to sit through multiple town halls where they paraded marquees of all the people who did get promotions.  It felt like everyone was getting a promotion BUT ME.  At this point my manager had done a complete 180 and was pretty angry I had been neglected.  During my 2020 performance review I got the highest possible rating.\n\nDespite all this, the corp still tried to say no to my promotion.  This brings us to March 2021.  Upon hearing their refusal again I got more aggressive with my job search.  There were some murmurings that my promotion was going through but it was still taking forever and I was given no ETA.\n\nAfter taking a hackerrank from a company and probably getting what I would consider a C- to D+ on it (finished 4\/5 of the problems, most without all test cases fulfilled) I was able to secure an offer of 85k.  I told my employer I was going to leave if they weren't able to get my promotion and more than the offer by Friday.\n\nI was contacted the next day by the manager of software engineering and asked for my range, which I said was 90-100.  He offered me my promotion and 80 on the spot which I turned down, and was confused by.  Pretty much said give me 90-100 or I'm walking.\n\n24 hours later I had secured the promotion to level 3 and a new salary of 90k a year.  It's amazing how fast these things can turn around when you threaten to walk.  I'm pretty happy now, and I didn't want to leave the company I work for because it has great perks and an awesome work life balance.\n\nThanks for reading!",

He says that at the moment he can't tell me anything. \n* Yesterday I asked him if my next steps at this company were to continue the co-op or if any positions have opened since I graduate soon. I have not gotten a response as of the writing of this post.\n\nWhile I understand that the bottom line ultimately affects the availability of positions, this company has also been hiring for similar positions while I've been co-op'ing for them, so I find the 'quarterly results' reasoning to be a bit questionable.\n\nThat being said, I can tell that my boss has definitely made an attempt to get me a full-time position since he has generally been impressed with my work. I have a feeling that he couldn't tell me anything in April because he was in the middle of discussing it with the company.\n\nAs for the lack of response from yesterday's email, I think it's most likely because he thinks that I'm going to leave if he tells me there isn't a position now. \n\nI haven't had trouble landing interviews, and I know that it's only a matter of time before I land a position somewhere. Money is a little tight, but I will be able to manage for the time being. So, should I give my two weeks' notice?",

    "body":"In my country employers usually give a salary range so wide that it is not informative. In the first phone call they usually try to know what would you expect. A strategy I'm using as of recently is to not to put red lines at this stage so that I get to hear an offer. This shows me if the employer is paying according to market, which in turn tells me about expected employee rotation and overall satisfaction.\n\nFor this one position the range went from junior salaries to senior salaries. I'm clearly in the senior category, and was offered a high junior salary. This is lower than any of the other offers I got this year, and only a bit higher than what I earned in my junior times.\nShould I try to negotiate given the situation? Or just look elsewhere? For me it is a big red flag that they even tried.\n\nEDIT: On the other hand, it is (almost) 100% remote and the commuting would be short. They also said they review salaries every year (which I don't really believe, in my experience that never happens)",

I graduated a year ago in May 2020 and getting to for a famous entertainment\/tech company seems like a dream come true. This internship pays me 1\/3rd less than what I\u2019m being paid right now. Here are some thoughts I had about this scenario: \n\nIf I leave my current company and go for Disney, I\u2019m going for something... \n\n1. I have a chance for something that seems like a lifetime! It\u2019s like you rather go for something and say you did it rather than regretting later that you should have done it \ud83d\ude2d \n2. My dream company is Disney \n3. It might open opportunities for me because I work for Disney at a certain period \n4. And I\u2019m looking for a job now anyway trying to get out of my current job! \n5. It\u2019s 6 months and the job isn\u2019t secure \n\nIf I decline the offer from Disney,\n\n1. I don\u2019t like my job that I\u2019m currently at and I\u2019ll keep thinking about declining that offer I had from my dream company that I had a chance to! \n2. I have a full time job now vs 6 months at Disney.\n3. My associates I work with now are amazing which I can make new friends at Disney so I\u2019m not too worried about that. \n4. The pay is way more here than in Disney \n5. Can work and still make money while looking for a new job rather than a deadline if I were at Disney \n\nI am so excited about this opportunity but the thought of leaving my current full time job for \u201cjust a 6 month internship\u201d, which makes me so overwhelmed! \n\nI started this job last December 2020, and my internship begins in August 2021! I had an internship with Disney back in August 2020 but it got canceled due to COVID - 19.  I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m risking for something that isn\u2019t secure when I have something already secured. And I know my parents wouldn\u2019t be too happy with that as well. I want to ask for time off but 6 months seems like a lot of time. \n\nI\u2019m 23 and I live with my parents. I\u2019m saving a lot of money now but my current job requires a lot of relocation in the future for higher positions. The situation at home is getting unbearable which is why I\u2019m always out all the time until I have to come home.\n\nSo it really feels like I\u2019d be wasting this opportunity if I I don\u2019t take it. And this internship is a big change for me where I feel like I can\u2019t say no. But I feel like if I leave my full time position for something that\u2019s temporary - I would feel very uptight about it. \n\nI\u2019m afraid I may be making a huge mistake for my future and feel so indecisive as to the pathway I should take. If someone has some good advice, I would love to hear it and would greatly appreciate your input!",

I developed a web app that manages a very detailed database of soccer match data and wanted to share\/market what I've built to help me land my next job, so I was wondering the best way to share this project.  It's not really possible to deploy the project since the app is for manipulating a database (running scrape jobs, resolving data anomalies, etc.) not for an end-user, so I think its more appropriate to demonstrate the functionality in an article or video format.\n\nGiven this, I was considering various options like\n\n* Publishing a LinkedIn article\n* Making a YouTube video and sharing in professional networks\n* Creating a \"showcase\" website that demonstrates functionality. (Perhaps just a page in a personal website?)\n\nBut I wasn't necessarily satisfied with any of these options, because most of these networks have a high volume of posts and I'm not sure something that's not flashy would get much traction.\n\nIf any one has any suggestions or any personal experience marketing their projects it would be extremely helpful!",

It's a big company most of you have heard of, but I'll keep their name quiet.\n\nMy expectations for this internship were to maybe debug some code, write small scripts (I work for an automation team), and do small things to start. I wrote maybe half of a working script before I got assigned a major project. \n\nWhile I'm grateful for the experience this gives me, I still feel like maybe I was overworked? Overestimated? I'm to build a web app from front-to-back, that helps us automate some internal workflows. I was assigned this entirely to myself, the intern, and had freedom to choose the tech stack. I was given some repos and libraries to reference, as they were similar\/needed to what I was tasked to build. Then, off I go to build an entire web app.\n\nI was interviewed for Python automation, but now I'm building a fullstack web app from scratch. I'm spending most of my time writing React code, which I had 0 knowledge of going into this. I was hoping for more Python work, as I would like to go into Data Science in the future, and Python is heavily needed for that, but I'm stuck writing JavaScript.\n\nTo be fair, I have learned a ton. Enough to produce a pretty usable app, but there's a lot of fault and bugs that I'm sure are due to my lack of experience. I'm constantly rewriting my code, my manager doesn't look over my code too often, and I'm kinda just this free-roaming fullstack web developer with little guidance.

    "title":"Moving From a Support Role to a Development Role?",
    "body":"I've just got a full-time job as a Technical Support Engineer for B2B product start-up, and the role sounds amazing. I'm also graduating in a month, so luckily enough, I wouldn't have to job hunt after that.\n\nHowever, in the long run, Support isn't what I would like to do. Moreover, my mentor at the company says that, after a year of working in support, I would be able to switch to a team of my liking, depending on my skills, ofcourse.\n\nAnd here's where I'm stuck. I do know that I want to go for a development role, rather that marketing, or Customer relations, etc. But what sort of developer? Full Stack Engineer is something I'm currently eyeing. My final year project is based on NLP, so ML\/AI also sounds great, but I hear that freshers or people with just a year of experience aren't preferred for it. I have some knowledge of iOS app development, so that seems like a possible alley too.\n\nTo give you a clear picture, here is my list of preference, and how much I know I'm each:\n\n1. Full Stack\/Web Dev - Good with front end (just, good); okay with backend, need to be a lot better; can learn database, it's been more that 2 years since I typed a query\n\n2. iOS - Only learning a little but of Swift, still not good, but will be soon\n\n3. ML\/AI - decent exposure through a research project (yet to be published), however, it doesn't interest me as much as the previous two\n\nI'd say it's almost a tie between 1 and 2\n\nNow, coming to the long route; let's say I'm not able to move to a Dev role at my present company after a year, for whatever reason. What should my next plan be? How can I move to a Dev role, from a support role.\n\nAnd if anyone can give me tips on how to learn, or what to learn to be good at the mentioned fields, please do help me out\n\nCheers :)",

    "body":"TLDR; husband is depressed and overwhelmed and stopped working again. But we are in debt for his startup. What can I do?\n\n\\---\n\nMy husband has been doing startups for over 8 years. He has been as an executive within several startup companies in the first few years, then he started to do his own startups one after another. He failed at most of it. One of them is however still alive but he got a fight with his former partner so he left that company.\n\nLast year he got really depressed and not working for half of year. This year, he got another idea and found another guy who he found really happy to work with as business partners so they started a new company. He was super excited and felt happy again. He's been meeting people for several months and I would say he's actually doing very well at impressing people. But recently he started to be depressed again. I think he tends to get tired or overwhelmed by the things he doesn't like to do (exp, real management work, financial, etc), and he keeps having new ideas he wants to do and gets distracted. Also he borrowed some money so I think he's also very anxious about finance. Anyway, recently since he's depressed, he basically stopped working, instead, he watches TV and playing video games most of the time.\n\nI don't know what to do. I tried to cheer him up or ignore his emotions and just focusing my own stuffs, but it didn't help. I tried to talk to him a long time ago (this kind of situation is not the first time, it happens to him a lot) and he just got more depressed or angry, or he went to work the rest of that day but return to play games the next day...I wasn't anxious when he borrowed the money, because I thought it's normal in the beginning phase, but now I am really worried. One day, he said he wanted to go to restaurants, but I said we are in debts so we should save any little pennies. But he disagreed and still went out.\n\nI'm not just worrying about finance, I'm more worried about him. With his serial entrepreneurship history, I think a lot of companies will avoid hiring him if someday he wants to go back to be an employee. Also because he was either CTO or CEO, so a lot of senior developer positions will just overlook him. The last reason I'm worried is because, it looks like if he fails this time or abandons it again, he will think his life is completely over and it will be very hard for him to get back to his feet again.",

I would have to do 2 more years paying tuition and wasting time or I could do what I enjoy doing and live the life that I want. I\u2019m asking for advice because my friends aren\u2019t that helpful and I\u2019m getting mixed opinions, because if I drop out then I might regret not getting a degree and that I\u2019m still young, and if I stay I\u2019m just wasting my time.\n\nThis is a big decision so I would just like to see what you guys would do in my situation, also I feel like my parents would not be cool with me dropping out. \n\nTL;DR: Don\u2019t wanna do CS full-time after Uni and I already have businesses started up and creating really good income, is it worth to stay and just finish the degree?",

Ultimately I'd like to spend most of my time practicing meditation and creating music.\n\nAccordingly I don't like the idea of working a fulltime job. Rather I'd like to be self-employed and work 4-5 focused hours every day of the year. I'm willing to live frugally and remain single for the time being. I'm disciplined and have blocked any distractions out of my life. It's not that I'm lazy and don't want to work, it's just that my priorities are Buddhism and to a lesser extend music.\n\nLast year I decided to learn fullstack development and have so far acquired the following skills:\n\n* HTML, CSS, JS, Tailwind\n* React, Redux, React Native\n* NodeJS + Express + MongoDB\n* Passport + other auth stuff\n\nMy plan is to start by continually publishing web and mobile apps, especially apps which I would use myself as a musician. I do have a couple of ideas which don't yet exist on the market. I think these might possibly become another stream of passive income, in case people actually start using them. In case nobody starts using them I hope to have a pretty good portfolio, thus being somewhat employable.\n\nWorking part-time is something I could definitely see myself doing, but I don't know how realistic getting such a position is.\n\nFreelancing is another avenue which I'd like to pursue both as a fullstack developer and a musician. \n\nI'd highly appreciate any advice on how to approach all of this.\n\nMay you be happy :)",

    "body":"I know Im going to get backlash for this but I believe that being able to communicate your interests to your manager is very important- a common theme this sub struggles in.\n\nI was recently hired for an embedded team (Team A) couple of months ago. Due to some conflicts I was loaned to a full stack team (Team B)  approx 6mo - 1 year.  During team selection, I interviewed with the Team B manager who said they have a lot of funding and they can keep me long term if I wanted to stay. Because this was over the phone 1-on-1 I am not sure if this was agreed upon between both managers. The culture doesnt seem toxic but I cant tell..\n\nFast forward to 3 months later... The hiring manager from Team A calls me and says I am able to move over to their team. Great! I thought- Then... they state I have 2 options move to the embedded test team or lab operations team for couple months of training then transition to the embedded development team. Both test and lab teams dont interest me (sounds like combination of SDET and devops but not really) and I am losing hope in those roles. Also the tech stack and process isnt as modern for the embedded team compared to the full stack team.\n\nI have a meeting with my hiring manager from Team A this week. I plan to let them know I want to stay with the dev team. My only concern is promotions. The dev team is remote for me while the others are in the bay area or east coast. Without an on-site manager in my area I feel like this will be an uphill battle for promotions. At any rate if I go to embedded team I will likely leave as Im no longer interested in that career path. Only thing holding me back for 1 year is the hiring and relocation bonuses...\n\nYOE: \\~1 embedded. 0.5 full stack\n\nBSEE background and graduating grad school for MSCS this fall.   \n\n\nTLDR: Hired as embedded swe. Temp loaned to full stack team for 6months - 1 year with loaned manager saying I could potentially stay. Budgeting (?) conflicts resolved and I would be transferred to embedded team which I lost interest in. Not sure how to talk to hiring manager to let them know I want to stay. I just want to be transparent with my interests.",

    "body":"I am interviewing at Slalom for an AWS associate consultant position. I also currently have an offer from Reef technology for a junior software developer position.   \nI am trying to figure out which job would help me excel in my career. I just graduated from a bootcamp so this would be my first SWE job.   \nThe Slalom position offers a lot of training in AWS cloud and I've read a lot of great reviews on glassdoor. It's their first launch of an AWS cloud residency program that runs for 2-years where I would be trained on the AWS cloud platform. For the junior software developer position at Reef, I'll primarily be working front-end and I have the opportunity to work permanently remote. The glassdoor reviews for Reef aren't that great but they are coming from other types of jobs like valets, drivers, and kitchen cooks. I've met the team I'd be working for at Reef and they seem great. They were a smaller startup that recently got acquired by Reef a couple of months ago.  \nA developer friend advised me to go for the Reef job because it's more of a typical SWE job and I guess being a consultant isn't really that glamorous in the cs world? I'd love to hear others' opinions on being an AWS cloud tech consultant vs a typical junior software developer and which job I should take if I do end up getting an offer Slalom.",

    "body":"Hi all. A little background about me... I graduated from a MS in Math last May. I have extensive coursework in math\/stats\/CS\/ML, did a computation-heavy thesis (simulations in Python, not ML) which led to a publication as first author, and taught undergrad calculus. My university was a no-name state university in a rural area with few connections to tech and I don't have much of a network. I have no industry experience\/internships -- I intended to do a PhD but realized it wasn't for me.\n\nDue to health issues I've been taking time off after graduating. I've sharpened my technical skills and completed a few projects in the last few months and have started applying for jobs. I think my background and interests are most suited to a DS role; however, these roles seem to be highly contested by PhDs and people with several YoE. My math background should put me ahead of many candidates (e.g. non-quantitative BS + MSDS), but I feel my lack of a PhD or previous experience prevents me from being a strong candidate. Also, because of how poorly-defined DS roles are, I get the sense a lot of companies don't know what they're looking for, and the interviews can test you on anything.\n\nI've heard that starting as a analyst or SWE is a better route into DS\/ML. I'm not really interested in the dashboarding and SQL duties that an analyst role entails. I've learned some web dev skills (Django, JS\/React, etc.) to deploy ML models and think a SWE (web dev) role could be fitting. I'd have to practice LC like hell, though.\n\n**Given my background should I apply to DS or SWE positions to optimize my chance of landing a job?** I'm more aligned with DS, but it is insanely competitive at entry level, and my callback rate has been low. Alternatively, I have *some* SWE skills and the barrier to entry is lower.",

    "body":"Hi,\n\nI always loved doing my own frontend projects, so I build up a small portfolio and landed a job as frontend developer for a web agency. However, I hated my job so much that I'm switching to backend now.\n\nThe thing is, while doing your own frontend portfolio projects you are developer, client and designer all at the same time. That means you can get as creative as you want. You want a website with a poop emoji as cursor? You can do it. Nobody dictates how something should look, act or behave. You are completely free. Kinda like an artist.\n\nHowever, working as frontend developer felt like the exact opposite. Your only task is to translate the ideas of your designer and his clients into code. Your website has to be a perfect copy of a template somebody else has made. It's was depressing and I simply couldn't stand it anymore.  Maybe it sounds a bit arrogant, but I'm not a google translator where you can input a design and who translates it into code and then displays the result in the browser.\n\nHow do you feel about it and what are your experiences?",

    "body":"Hi! First time posting here. I'm a junior dev with high expectations for my career. My current goals are to cover the gaps of my knowledge and experience regarding software development: containers, containers management, DevOps, get solid on cloud computing, etc. Besides, I want to become a software architecture \/ software engineer, knowing how to plan and execute projects from end-to-end. \n\nThat said, I received an offer to work at a company paying me 50% more than what I receive today. The technical interviewer said I'd be working with Java, Spring, Docker, Kubernetes and Mendix (low-code). Regarding Java and Spring, okay that seems pretty regular stuff. Docker and Kubernetes are techs I want to learn, yay! What I'd dread, though, would be to work with visual coding, drag and drop kind of things, and that's what I fear about Mendix \/ low-code. I don't know much about it and neither about what's the extent of it in the project.\n\nWhat you guys think? What do you know about Mendix? I'm somewhat insecure, but my current job is not great either as I'm using a visual platform for developing chatbots. The only good part is doing Lambda integrations in AWS and using DynamoDB a little here and there, but not great by any stretch.\n\nCheers!",

Since then I\u2019ve at 2 different banks. One as a teller and another in the call center and some landscaping work. I just want something more for myself and I don\u2019t want my age to be a factor as to yeah I should have this and that figured out, etc. \n\nI started school at my local community college in the fall of 2019, I finished up my last 2 gen Ed\u2019s, college algebra and csc 111. The following spring I took precalc 1 and csc 112 and ended up failing those classes because the pandemic started and zoom classes just wasn\u2019t doing it for me (yes I know that\u2019s a bad excuse and I should of passed). So fast forward to now, I will be taking precalc 1 & 2 this summer.\n\nMy goal is to take all the lower level CS classes at my community college and transfer them back to the university I first attended. At that point I will have to finish my upper level courses, electives and another math class (calc 2 I think it is).\n\nAt my community college, I have 7 classes left to take:\nComputer science 2\nDatabase management systems \nData structures and algorithms \nDiscrete mathematics \nCalc 1  \nPrecalc 1 & 2\n\nAll the classes above except precalc 1 & 2 are transferable to university.\n\nOkay so I guess that\u2019s a lot of background info...but my question is it worth going back to school at this age? I would like to be a software engineer. A lot of ppl have counted me out unfortunately. I want to prove them wrong as well as prove to myself I can do this. Also Idk if information science & technology could be an option as well because the CS math courses are kinda scary and I\u2019m not a math wiz or anything. IS&T and CS at the university I plan to attend have the same lower level courses. \n\nOkay I\u2019m done rambling. Thank you",

I think I have a knack for it and really enjoy it. \n\nI was considering joining a boot camp but decided on taking a couple of Udemy courses prior to committing to something so expensive. \nI\u2019m currently taking this Udemy course on [Web Development](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/course\/the-ultimate-fullstack-web-development-bootcamp\/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=Webindex_Catchall_la.EN_cc.CA&utm_term=_._ag_119831896715_._ad_504641403594_._kw__._de_m_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-423967289464_._li_1002287_._pd__._&matchtype=b&gclid=CjwKCAjwm7mEBhBsEiwA_of-TK2vG3HRPOHcjO879FBTiIGmr7y0IoJw6xgtyS60xJ3JfE2Hye_z3hoCUHQQAvD_BwE) and was going to later take a course in Data Science to gauge what I have a preference for.\n\nJudging by the course contents, is the web development course enough to get an entry level job? It has some projects included in the course and I was also thinking of making a couple of personal projects afterwards as well to help if necessary. If that\u2019s not enough, what should I look at for next steps? \n\nI\u2019m also wondering what field in software development I might fit best in - I really enjoyed the problem solving aspect in the course I took (it was mainly implementing data structures and algorithms from scratch), but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not what jobs are actually like. From my limited knowledge, I think something back-end or data science would be more technical and might suit me better, but I\u2019d love some opinions from people more knowledgeable.

When I do get stuck, they can't help and Im just left furiously Googling the answer to things which has been working out okay so far. He asked me to read a paper on a particular algorithm and after I made a presentation on it I had some questions like in what instance would you use this over traditional CNNs and he couldn't even answer. \n\nThe internship is a year long so it's not a suck it up and get it over with type situation, and I'm currently not in a position to be able to leave the internship. I'm firstly slightly resentful that I was baited and switched when I had other opportunities in ml that I turned down to join his project. And secondly, I feel like I'm not learning anything from this supervisor. He keeps pushing me to work on this platform when he is of no help at all (his idea of helping is asking me for a design change when I hardly know what I'm doing) and is deviating from the internship agreement where I was supposed to be learning ml. I did try to express my unhappiness (quite poorly, I must admit) but nothing has changed. Also to note this a research team, and my internship allowance is paid for by another entity and not the company itself. I'm not an employee there.\n\nEdit: it was the 12th week into the internship that I had my first taste of ml, but was subsequently told to get right back to developing the platform. Also it's just strange that they are asking me to build the platform even before the ml model has been developed when the platform is supposed to be fore the model (I'm guessing it has something to do with my supervisors deliverables that's why he's pushing me to do it).",

We host meetings and I am navigating every line of code and when they pass the project over to me I write everything and try explain my logic. \n\nThey are nice people and I understand it\u2019s not entirely familiar with them but I feel it\u2019s unfair to be lumped with all the work and not only that they are insisting we mob program the whole project as they are not confident enough to add components to our app. So far the only thing they have contributed was a copy and pasted line of code.\n\nWe are currently learning agile methodologies and it\u2019s hard to apply that to the project when one person is doing everything.

    "body":"English is not my native language. Please excuse any grammatical errors.\n\nI have roughly 1 year of experience with node.js development. I primarily worked with NoSQL databases like MongoDB and DynamoDB and I know a bit of docker and basic ci\/cd integration as well. I was wondering if I should dive deeper into being a backend dev should I focus on node and learn more of its frameworks (meteor, sails, koa, etc.) Or should I know know multiple backend languages or should I learn react or any other FE framework and become a fullstack dev? Which career path has a better future outlook? \n\nI know that as long as I'm good in my field I'll do great and all that. I'm concerned about this because I'll start school this September in Canada and I am from a south Asian country so I am not very familiar with the western job market situation and I have seen a lot of people applying to 100s of jobs over months and hardly getting any interviews so this has somewhat added to my anxiety.\n\nThank you for any and all suggestions.",

I want to leverage my previous technical experience so I was wondering if you all wanted to help me find my place in the Computer Science world. I already know python due to using for research before. However, the data science route seemed to be the most stringent on degrees and certifications. That's why I started to pick up web dev. Seemed the most fluid and I can knock out javascript and a couple projects by the end of the year.\n4. My only caveat with not leverging my current resume is that I do have a salary requirement. I am right now helping my family out and paying for their bills along with mine for now since they got screwed by the pandemic. It won't be for long but I would need to maintain my salary of 89k atleast to do so. Is that doable if I switch? I can leetcode very very well. I am learning the whole algorithms and data structures aspect but, my math background kinda helps out a lot (I dual majored in math in college).

A two year contract seems reasonable since they would want a return on their investment. The problem it seems like employment can be inconsistent. I've seen people say they've been put on projects that only last a couple moths. Afterwards it seems like they would have to wait until Revature finds a new position for them once their current is over and finding a job on your own with a company they're not affiliated with would violate the contract. If that's the case, Revature doesn't seem worth it since there's a possibility I could be in a completely new state, out of work, and at the mercy of my employment company. Do I have this right?

    "body":"Hey guys!\n\nA senior software developer with around 5 years of experience here (27yrs)\n\nI have hard time choosing between staying in my current company and taking on a new role.\n\nLet me provide you with some background.\n\nI'm around 1.6 years in my current company, couple of months ago I asked about a raise and it took very long time for them to sort this out (like 2-3 months). Since I wasn't aware whether I'm getting the raise or not  (when inquiring I was only told that it's in progress, I sort of felt like I'm not getting it) I began searching for something new. \n\nI applied for couple of companies, got couple much better offers and told my manager look, I got these much better offers what raise can you offer me to stay - this was very lucrative since they offered me 30% raise. The offers I got were still better by around 20% but since I like my current job, maybe it's a bit boring but I'm working only couple hours a day realistically with no stress and flexibile working hours, I stayed.\n\nBut then there was this one company that I was in recruitment process with and just for kicks, because I got the raise already, I told them I want a LOT of money - we're talking around 50% more than my current role with a raise. \n\nIt's worth mentioning that I work in Europe where I'm already earning the top 2% salary in my country.\n\nIt seems they weren't really discouraged by that and I got the offer.\n\nNow I'm faced with a really tough decision - whether to stay in my comfortable current role which already pays a lot ,with no stress and working couple of hours a day or change for this new one.\n\nThe new role has couple of cons though\n\n* the working hours are not that flexible (8-16) I prefer working a bit earlier (7-15)\n* more work - I'm assuming I will have to start working like a regular human being 8 hours a day\n* more responsibility since I would assume ownership of their app and will be the only person working on it\n* changing jobs is always stressful since there will be new people which might not be reasonable (the guys I spoke during the interview were pokay though)\n\nI feel I'm already a bit spoiled by the current role and it might be healthy for me to start working more :D \n\nBut whenever I think about the cons I also think about money which would allow me to buy a house in my country every year :D",

I am not overenthusiastic about having a clean code or using the best design pattern etc. I am not interested in learning new technologies or nerding out about a new tech stack.I have also noticed that in B \/ A- level companies, there is undue pressure on developers to meet deadlines, perform R&D, produce a result and at the end of the day, fight the fire if something goes wrong. I get too overwhelmed by all the code reviews, GIT merges, build failures, dealing with scrum, story points, deadlines, product issues, etc.\n\nOne thing I do enjoy is writing automated and integration tests. Figure out how things can break, and automating that. I feel like I know what needs to be done, there are no surprises or unknowns and it being lower-level work, there are no scrum master and product owner constantly on my tail for status updates. As long as I provide agreed-upon test coverage, everyone leaves me alone.\n\nI am not expecting a mega-level salary by fully transitioning to SDET but just curious how is \/ will be the job market for it if I ever get laid off or want to switch companies.",

    "title":"Working as a Software Engineer gives me constant anxiety. Contemplating a career-shift to Psychology! Am I crazy?",
    "body":"So, a bit of context.\n\nI've been in tech for a bit less than 4 years now. Initially, I was working with a lot of technologies like .NET\/Android\/Deployement as an intern\/Jr Developer. But since mid-2018 I've been mostly working in Front-end. In these 4 years, I've worked at 3 different companies (a small tech service company, a big product based e-commerce firm, and a couple years-old decently funded startup). So, it's safe to say that I've seen it all.  \n\n\nBack in high-school I had a huge interest in CS and always aced the CS exams and that's the reason I got a CSE degree (from a below-average school with average grades). But that's not the case now. Since the past 2 years, I'm constantly doubting if CS is really the right career for me. To be honest, the only reason I'm in tech is because it pays well. But, there's no gurantee that 10 years from now, there would still be such high salaries for software engineers. Currently the demand-supply ration is skewed towards engineers (for mid and senior positions). But, with 10 year olds learning to code in school, It's hard to envision what the future will be.\n\n  \nI'd love to study CS concepts even if I wasn't paid to do it. But working in the industry, it just induces so much anxiety to me on a daily basis. One reason for that is that I'm just not good enough and I'm probably mediocre at best (possiblly low-iq or I'm just not wired that way). But even if that were true, I see a lot of mediocre guys who are living a stress-free life.\n\n  \nThe reason for my anxiety is that there's so much to wrap your head around and it's hard to keep up if you want to stay in the industry. Due to living in constant hell, I'm considering a career-shift in psychology due to the following reasons:\n\n1. It would help me understand myself better and figure out the issues I'm going through\n2. I've always been intersted in how the brain functions what causes addictions.\n3. It woud give me some time to heal my brain\n4. Psychology degrees are not as demanding as CS (from what I've heard). This could be a chance to explore other interests and figure out what I really want to do with my life.\n\n  \nPlan is to go for a master's degree and then probably go into a specalised field where I could use both, my CS and Psych degree or work my way towards a Phd.\n\nI don't know if I'm delusional or just straight up crazy. But, life's too short.  I don't want to be 80 and have regrets that I just wasted my life doing something I wasn't enjoying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr;**\n\nWorkign as a software engineer in the industry is mentally taxing. Considering going to Uni for a master's in psychology.",

    "body":"I am a 24 year old software engineer intern for a small R&D company. Pay is what the average intern makes in 2020 ($25\/hr), and I am part time. I like the job I guess, but I don't have any work experience in CS related fields besides this one, so what do I know about whether I really like it or not lol. I've been here for 2 months, by the end of month 3 I am apparently supposed to either get fired or be offered a full time position there (I am like 90% sure I'm getting a full time offering fwiw). No idea what the full time salary would be, but I imagine its probably around $36\/hr? Just based off vague salary discussions with my friend who works there lol\n\nI feel like I have so little experience, and so I feel a desire to reach out and just acquire as many work experiences as possible. To me, working somewhere new often seems like an important thing to do since I'm young and trying to dip my feet in the water you know? But my friend says its too soon and I should at least get a full year with this company, saying that it looks bad if I were to work somewhere for less than a year. However, don't internships carry the connotation of being a work thing that is understood to not have to be a year+ endeavour? So I was thinking maybe I could get away with only working there for 3-4 whatever months, and then snagging a new job that hopefully teaches new things and experiences I wouldn't normally learn from working at this specific company. I have to acknowledge though, I am so new to a lot of software engineering that if I worked at this company for a full year I know I would learn plenty of software development...\n\nI made a bullet list of reasons I want to and don't want to leave. I was wondering if anyone here could graciously offer their advice\/suggestion on what I should do? **Should I try to find a new job after working at an internship for 3-4 months, or stay with the company for a full time SW Eng. position because its too short of a time to dip out?**\n\nReasons I want to leave:\n* I feel a strong urge to get many different work experiences while I'm young\n* I want to work abroad badly. I'd stay with this job if they let me work remote 100% of the time temporarily, like for a 6 month span so that I could live abroad, but I highly doubt that they'd let me do that even if covid is still going on\n* Not 100% sure, but I think I could find a job with better pay than this company without much difficulty. I just say that because I think its a small enough company and the nature of the company + my experiences so far makes it seem like the kind of company that compensates for paying employees less by giving them greater work freedom\/control over their actual programming and promising better wlb.\n\nReasons I don't:\n* This company has incredible wlb, definitely better than almost all other places\n* I actually work with a long time college friend here who helped me get the job, I would definitely miss working with him but you know, if its better for my future career prospects I'm not gonna stay at one company forever just to work with a friend",

    "body":"A certain co-worker whom I have had virtually no interactions with previous to this most recent project has on 2 separate occasions accused me of ulterior motives and such which include:\n\n1. When I raised certain concerns about the ability to integrate a new technology into multiple projects that all currently have different build library dependencies and asked about a compromise solution that has been brought up before, I was told that I need to show more respect to the time that was put in to the current proposed solution and that they felt they were only hearing excuses for not wanting to use a new technology (note that I am not the only one to raise these questions before this happened).\n2. When a discussion about this technology was held with a wider group of people that are involved in projects that would be incorporating this new technology at some point (some relatively soon and other a bit later), another person brought up the issue about the build library dependencies (and other issues) and suggested the same compromise solution I did in the previous meeting and I made mention of a task that we had planned for testing that possible issue (this was the outcome of the previous mentioned meeting). Just me bring this up made the same person from the previous meeting tell me that it was an inappropriate setting to bring this up (which I though was odd as that task directly relates to the question that was asked) and that he feared that what I am doing is trying to spread unfair fear and doubt about this technology (other people have brought up other \/ similar concerns but maybe this person thinks they are only doing that because of me or something).\n\nIf people want to disagree with my opinions or even concerns that I had, I have no problem with that, I am not a stranger to being in the minority when it comes to certain opinions on how to proceed with things but the outcomes of these disagreements are always based on data in some form and not accusing other people of lying or making things up to get their way. What I have virtually zero tolerance for is some telling me I mean something other than what I am saying. If I thought a piece of technology should not be used, I would say exact that with whatever reasons I have for thinking that way.\n\nNormally I would try to have a one on one with this person to figure out a better way to work together however given that in my limited interactions with this person I have already be accused of some ulterior motive that is deeper than what I am actually say, I would have concerns about a one on one and how this person might\u00a0view\u00a0that\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0completely\u00a0different\u00a0manner.\n\nRight now I really don't want to work with this other person at all as I think this kind of hostile work interaction is completely avoidable and counter-productive to the work we are trying to do (I have only deal with this kind of situation, though not directly, once in my 13+ years as a software engineer) and adding this kind of unnecessary stress in addition to the stress that is inherit with the job is just not worth it for me but because of the dynamics of the teams, I think future interactions are unavoidable. The only thing I can think of is agreeing to work on projects with this person but just holding any feedback I might have as to decisions on how to move forward on those project to myself to avoid derailing any project because of something that might not even be related to the project itself and just doing what tasks are given to me.\n\nHow would you handle this situation?",

    "body":"I'm currently on the job market for data science positions, have about 4 yoe, and I'm shocked at the number of analyst and engineering-related skills that a lot of these listings look for. Don't get me wrong, I think in many ways it's helpful and reasonable to expect data scientists to know SQL, be familiar with spark, *maybe* sagemaker and its equivalents, but so many listings seem to be seeking individuals who are experts as data scientists while also being experts at things like building dashboards, reporting, data lakes, pipelines, system design, engineering-intensive scalable cloud stuff...\n\nAre these listings the equivelant of unrealistic software engineering listings seeking \"rock star programmers\" who do everything under the sun? I'm an expert in selecting, training, and tuning ML algorithms, exploring large datasets, gathering all of the info needed to truly understand what is what and what things mean, finding ways to solve business problems using data science and defining use-cases... I've worked alongside engineers and analysts in the past but I've never been expected to be one, but maybe to have my skills overlap with theirs occasionally.\n\nDo I need to get a bunch of AWS certs for all of their data tools and reporting tools? Is that what's expected these days or is that just what a lot of the more out of touch postings look for?",

I got contacted by a small consultancy company, and after talking with the CEO he offered me a chance to work on a new project developing a WEB application from the ground up, that will offer a new service to their clients.\n\nMy concern is that only me and another intern would be working on the project. The choice of the tech-stack, design, etc. will be left up to us. It feels like quite a lot of responsibility for an intern with not that much experience.\n\nAnother problem is that the CEO will be our supervisor. He isn't a strong programmer and we won't have access to more experienced developers to learn from, ask questions, or get some suggestions. I lack the confidence that we can make the best decisions and handle all the aspects of development by ourselves as interns. On the positive side, if we come up with a viable solution we will have a job there after the internship.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I overthinking this and should just accept this internship position or try to find a place that has a bigger dev team that I could learn from? How important was it for you to communicate and learn from more experienced developers during your internship?\n\nTL;DR - Got offered an internship position in a small company where I won't be able to work with or learn from other, more experienced developers.

    "body":"Hey fellow redditors!\n\nI work in a startup as a Computer vision engineer (just title only lol).. I have to do frontend, backend, integrate software modules with robots, even go make dataset by myself from scratch, integrate custom circuits with the software myself, write unit tests and check if the machine (It's like a prototype for a production line with computer vision, robotics and other automated solutions) is working correctly. \n\nWhen I joined this startup back in August 2020, They literally gave me a shitty accountant's computer and was like good luck. No onboarding, no shit. They were like they want to do X. So I, from scratch had to build up the codebase that we currently have . Also note that there is nobody to help me label the images or to create datasets, I spend my time building datasets and implementing machine learning pipelines for this system. 50% of my time, I write new features for the code base I make, and the other 50% I test and make sure everything works (physically on the machine \/ hardware setup) without glitches. There were times when I had to literally go and solder connections between different microprocessors in different modules of this system. I had to setup the system infrastructure (Nvidia GPU Compute server + Network based control and integration different electronic subsystems) and Software Architecture from absolute scratch.\n\nNow the CEO (an asshole) keeps pushing new features one after the other like a feature creep, he doesn't care what I do, he doesn't understand shit about code. Nobody at this startup codes. Recently, he has stopped caring about this project like there are no meetings, or so regrading this major project. He gives a big fuck to the smallest things like why is there dust on the robots? (LOL). So recently, This Boomer CEO is like can you teach me how to code so he can do my job(lol wtf?) . I genuinely thought he is interested in learning programing. Now he is blackmailing me if I don't teach him with PowerPoint slides he is gonna fire me. How the fuck did I end up at this shit show?. Also the CEO is a moonlighting idiot, he rarely cares about this startup and does his 2nd job all the time. Recently he hired some interns to setup his mining server lol.\n\nOh by the way I get paid 1500$ per month lol (yep in a shitty 3rd world country).\n\nHow can I save my career ? How do I make an exit? How bad is my future gonna look when it says I left a company after 9 months. This is also my first job after college. Please Dear senior CSE, guide me. \n\nThanks.",

I understand a master\u2019s is typically necessary for an advanced career in the field and so, while in the college application process, I\u2019m keeping this in mind. I\u2019m currently debating whether to go to an OOS higher ranked AI\/CS school (places like UIUC, Georgia Tech, UW-Seattle, UC Berkeley) where I can potentially obtain a 5-year master\u2019s and likely would lead to slightly more career opportunities (but where tuition+board would likely be quite high) or to opt to go to my in-state school UVA and then go somewhere else for grad school. UVA certainly has a good CS program but for AI\/ML specifically, it\u2019s a bit lacking. And so, in the context of job placement, salaries, meaningful work (maybe researchy type jobs?), and stuff like that, which might be the better option? (Also there\u2019s a slight chance that I pursue a Ph.D if there\u2019s a certain career I come across that would require that type of degree)\n\nEdit: Obviously the whole 5 year masters thing isn\u2019t guaranteed, but that\u2019s definitely the option I would be going for if I was to go to an OOS school.",

    "body":"Hey everyone!\n\nI am a CS student who will be applying for jobs in tech later this year. After reading a couple of blog posts on employee experience at FAANG(all major tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple) and in other companies like Stripe, Lyft, Razorpay,etc, I have noticed something which I think might be crucial to career growth.\n\nSo I was reading about the procedure at Google, where there is promotion committee. You submit a report on how your contributions to Google helped it and why you should be promoted. Now this committee has never seen your work before and decides whether you should be promoted based on the application. But not everything is quantifiable, like how someone helped his teammates or made documentation for legacy project, etc. These things do not really have well defined metrics. So I believe there are many who work at FAANG but are not promoted easily. They are stuck at the same level for quit a few years.\n\nOn the other hand, companies like Stripe, or startups, etc, although may not provide similar benefits like FAANG, but due to their relatively smaller teams provide better communication among members. This does not mean easy promotion but this also does not mean that individual contributions are not noticeable.\n\nSo my doubt is, if I work at a big tech company for say 4-5 years but with no or just one promotion, then decide to quit and look for job at some other company, is the absence of promotion going to hurt my chances to get a job even though I used to work at the big tech company?\n\nOr if I work at startup, get a few promotions, and then look for job elsewhere, is that better?\n\nNow I am not saying big companies don't promote. One could argue that if one is competent enough company will promote that person. It is just that, since I haven't yet experienced working at a company, I don't know if the competent thing really plays that big of a role in real world or does show business has its role to play too.",

You have access to a wide network given you meet other people who are also in the program. I don't care about the fact that many people have it, recruiters are still impressed by GA Tech, and hiring managers who are too dumb to like another university just because it's a higher price tag and less people pay for it are not worth working for anyways. \n\nBonus question: I am having a hard time choosing between all the specializations.

    "title":"Interested in high school internship at IBM Markham",
    "body":"Hello, I am looking for a summer job and IBM has peaked my interest. I am a senior in high school and my grades have been quite good (so far average is about 94%) and I have some self taught Python experience. My biggest project so far has been making Tetris with PyGame. Will be looking to do some SQL and web development soon. I have also applied and been accepted to Ryerson and York for computer science (thinking of doing the co-op program)\n\nThere are two of the IBM positions I would like to apply for, one being a computer science co-op for high school students and a software developer high school intern.\n\nI am wondering if anyone could give me some insight on if I would be a good qualifier, if they offer pay in these internships and if they are strict on schedules (I would like to take at least a week going camping, but other times I can do on a weekend or something).\n\nHere are the links to the job postings:\n\n[https:\/\/www.peersight.com\/job\/ibm-computer-science-high-school-co-op-summer-in-markham-on?utm\\_campaign=google\\_jobs\\_apply&utm\\_source=google\\_jobs\\_apply&utm\\_medium=organic](https:\/\/www.peersight.com\/job\/ibm-computer-science-high-school-co-op-summer-in-markham-on?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic)\n\n[https:\/\/getcreativejobs.com\/job\/software-developer-high-school-intern\/?utm\\_campaign=google\\_jobs\\_apply&utm\\_source=google\\_jobs\\_apply&utm\\_medium=organic](https:\/\/getcreativejobs.com\/job\/software-developer-high-school-intern\/?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help would be appreciated.

    "body":"I need to make a tough decison and it's devouring my soul faster the longer I ignore it.\n\nI am a 20 year old guy from Turkey and last year I quit studying German Translation and Interpreting, it was my third year studying it. I quit because it was far away from my dreams and I have never been interested in any degree other than STEM degrees. \nSo I quit and started studying. I got medicated for my ADHD, learnt how to be disciplined for the first time in my life. I dreamt every day and worked hard for it but the exam is approaching, only 55 days left and I still can't score high enough to study CS at a decent school.\n\nI have studied so hard and went from being extraordinarily bad at maths to decent. Yet time wasn't enough to do good enough it seems.\n\nI will enter three exams: one is a general exam, other two are special exams for Language and Science\/Maths. \n\nNow I have two choices:\n\nI will either risk everything and keep pushing for a CS degree, I already study 8 hours a day and I will make it 10-12 for the remaining time I have until the exam. If I fail though, this means that I will have wasted a lot of time on science\/maths exam which means that I will do much worse on the general exam and language exam.\n\nOr I will accept the failure and throw my dreams into a trash bin, get realistic and study for the language and general exams so I can  at least go study one of the best language degrees in Turkey and study programming by myself and try to fill my portfolio during my language degree study. \n\nI realize this is a lot of stuff to read and it may be incoherent, I am sorry for that. I am really stressed and I need guidance. \n\nIs not having a major at CS a deal breaker? I am not interested in web stuff. My dream is to work in the AI side of things, Machine Learning and alike. I want to work in companies like Neuralink and other companies that mainly work on research side of things. \n\nI studied programming myself for about 1.5 years as I studied my German degree. I quit studying programming to work full time for the exams. So I am not clueless about programming and I love coding. I love technology, electronics and science but not some damn translation degree that will be irrelevant in 10 years as the technology advances.\n\nThank you for your time, I can provide any details needed if I forgot about some.",

    "title":"Are internships during college worth pursuing?",
    "body":"Hello. This is a question\/rant at myself.\n\nI have 3 semesters left (including this one) before graduating. Since college started, I've been trying to land an internship. I spread myself too thin trying to learn a lot of skills needed by the internships I find. I finally managed to interview once and I passed a technical interview but I sucked at the \"management\" interview (the one where they ask you behavioural questions) so I was rejected (they didn't tell me the reason, I just assumed that it's the management interview because it came after the technical one).\n\nIt's frustrating. Every internship requires a different set of skills (at least the ones in my country) and I always feel like my skills and projects aren't enough. Right now, my resume has many skills but I'm not really good in most of them, if I had to use them I will need to review and learn more about them.\n\nMeanwhile, I sort of neglected studying college subjects, telling myself I'll learn them later, but I now regret it. Maybe if I focused on studying the core CS subjects and did a decent project in each of them, I would have more opportunities when I graduate (e.g., be ready to do a master's).\n\nBut I'm still not sure if I should focus the time I have left solely on that or if I should still try to pursue internships. I think initially my desire to find an internship was a dumb one. I think it was along the lines of \"I want to be like Mark Zuckerberg\" or something. I thought I was special just because I started programming at 10 but boy was I wrong. Because of my humongous ego, I made a lot of bad decisions. I kept comparing myself to my colleagues who started interning or freelancing, one of them even worked as a full-fledged SWE in multiple companies!\n\nAnother reason of why I was rushing things so much is because of my anxiety that my chances of finding a job after I graduate will be very low without an internship. A lot of the companies I've seen are either looking for interns or senior devs.\n\nSo right now, I'm confused. I want to know if my fear is justified and if there's a rational reason people pursue internships during college. Right now, the only thing I can think of is money and experience. I need both but more importantly I need knowledge. I don't want to call myself an engineer if I don't have good grasp on these topics (I'm talking about OS, databases, distributed systems, even compilers).\n\n**TL;DR** I wasted a lot of time trying to land an internship but never did. Now I have 2.5 semesters left and I want to know if there's a merit in pursuing an internship or if I should just focus on college.\n\n**Edit** Some details about me:\n\n* I'm from Egypt\n* 2.7 GPA\n* I don't mind working in non-FAANG, in fact I've seen better working environments than FAANG\n* I would prefer living and working in a different country, if my job affords me to\n* I will probably need to work a while after graduating because I can't afford a Master's unless it's a scholarship or something",

I'm not sure what steps to take here, but hopefully, someone can shed light.\n\nMy approach (please correct me if this is not the right way to tackle it):\n\n1, I believe the smartest thing to do right now is to get a TN by becoming a Canadian Citizen.  AFAIk, you only do TN for as long as you can\u2019t get H1B. Good thing is TN can be extended \u201cindefinitely\u201d in 3-year increments, so as a Canadian, you can still work there as long as it takes to get H1B.  I  think you can work forever in the U.S with a  TN and all you have to do is re-apply every 3 years.\n\n2. Apply for H1B while working as a TN, I think I'm stuck with one employer with H1B and I might not be able to switch jobs during the time period.\n\n3. Get Green card because of H1B\n\n4.

    "body":"I have recently relocated to Belgium via a consulting company (they sponsored my working permit), and I'm feeling stuck because I found out that the whole thing is meme.  \nas a developer with +3 years of experience, I feel like the only 'serious' way to build a career, make real money and feel like really doing something is to either become a freelance\/independent software developer, or simply look for a company (preferably a company that builds ans sells software) that we find interesting, try to get hired by them and stick there for few years.  \n\n\nI can list many reasons why working for consulting company feels like a joke. \n\n* While looking for a client, I had to deal many and many times with very low IQ Hr people working for the supplier (= direct contact with the client) that had no idea what they're doing or what they're talking about, and I had to act cool and prove to them that I'm a good dog so that they forward my CV to the client. \n* My employer lies about my experience and sends a fake CV with more years of experience, so that he gets a better rate.\n* Most of the clients are proposing opportunities using technologies from the dark ages. And it seems like they outsource these roles because it's impossible for them to find someone to agree to get hired as an internal employee, and work on such projects.\n* While working for the client, there's a constant feeling of 'detachment', they expect the external developer to be involved with the team and project, but the truth is that he's merely a tourist there, and he can be laid off in 24 hours for reasons like budget issues or team organization. \n* Indian consulting companies keep taking the rates down, which makes it very hard to negotiate a decent salary raise in the future.   \n\n\nThis is my first time working for a consulting company, because in the past I worked only for companies that build and sell software(as internal developer). So I'm wondering if  it's the case everywhere in Europe when it comes consulting company , or I have to do a better research before accepting a job?",

    "body":"TLDR; Currently an applied scientist in NLP, but I suck at math and do not enjoy research, but I do enjoy writing and public speaking. Looking for suggestions on whether to take my career path towards MLE vs SWE vs PM\n\nHi! To provide some context, I'm currently an NLP applied scientist. I chose this job because I wanted to get into ML -- however, working with almost all PhDs my imposter syndrome is going through the roof. Also, I've never been very strong in math, I somehow got through college and my masters taking no math classes lol, but my current job assumes a strong basis in linear algebra. I am working in research but I don't like it -- I find it difficult to write papers and come up with new solutions to existing problems. \n\nWhy MLE: I think ML problems are super interesting, but my current AS role is very research focused.  I want to move out of this to hopefully something further away and closer to prod (i.e. what I think is the MLE role). Would my lack of math background be my Achille's heel here as well?\n\nWhy SWE: I did pass HC at Google for SWE a year ago when I was fresh out of college (though I chose not to go b\/c of the opportunities in ML) and made it into some other companies, so I think that my interviewing skills for SWE are not too bad. If I will have imposter syndrome forever as long as I'm in ML, going to SWE may not be a bad idea. Another plus is that I enjoy coding.\n\nWhy PM: Honestly not too sure of what the day-to-day of a PM looks like. However, I've actually grew up interested in humanities since I was a child until the middle of college (was always an aspiring writer\/journalist), so I think that public speaking and writing are some of my bigger strengths I have that I am unable to use as an engineer. Though I enjoy it, I do not necessarily think coding needs to be part of my job (though I do want to stay in tech) and I think that my past experience in ML and my strengths in writing\/speaking may be a plus.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

    "title":"Got my first Junior Software dev job, and I hate it here. HELP!",
    "body":"At 30 years old, I recently made the switch to a career in tech. Completed a bootcamp and landed my first junior software dev role a month ago, during my interview I asked about onboarding and training, I was told there would be training.\n\nI got hired at a small start up with a dev team consisting of 3 other people: 1 software architect and 2 other junior devs. The company\u2019s goal is to build a complex social media platform from scratch within 4 months. This first job has been absolute hell. \n\nMy onboarding process was to code a calculator in 4 days using a language and library I have never used before. My code for the calculator was never reviewed lol but the software architect believes that was enough training to now build strong working features for this platform. The problem is the SA has created a toxic environment where questions are answered with sarcasm and condescending tones. There is no structure, no documentation, the SA has no interest and no time to mentor me or spend time going over expectations. The SA is building the platform how he wants so all the code structure lives in his head and he doesn\u2019t particularly care to take time and explain anything to us. I understand he\u2019s in a shitty position where he has to build this huge platform singlehandedly with 3 Junior devs who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\n\nHe\u2019s been in the industry for 20 years and somehow expects us Junior devs to be able to pick up on his code quickly and churn out tickets in these sprints. Some of the tickets are beyond my scope of knowledge or skill. Whenever we have company meetings he always says \u201cI encourage my devs to ask questions\u201d and when I do ask questions it\u2019s met with hostility and impatience, and some rude comments about how annoying I am.\n\nHe spends a lot of time trolling me or the 2 other Junior devs when we take long to complete a ticket or he straight up tries to humiliate me and other juniors during our dev meetings if we make mistakes. He has literally given me an eye roll emoji as feedback. If I try and stand up for myself and explain I am new and still learning, it makes him troll even harder. I don\u2019t feel I am being given the grace to be a Junior dev and to make mistakes without fear of consequence and to learn in a safe environment. I feel like I\u2019m being set up for failure rather than success. I am not looking to be spoon-fed or have my hand held but this has been 4 weeks of insanity. I\u2019m tired of feeling like an incompetent dev, because of the lack of support and structure.\n\nI don\u2019t have a HR department and this is really taking a toll on my mental health. I am stressed all of the time, my anxiety is at an all time high, I can\u2019t ask for help without fear of being judged and ridiculed. I am constantly made to feel stupid. After speaking with peers I realize this is not a normal experience for a Junior dev. I\u2019m trying to stick it out so it doesn\u2019t look bad on my resume but I don\u2019t think I can last much longer in this demoralizing environment. \n\n I don\u2019t know if this is a \u201cgrass is greener on the other side\u201d moment. Any advice is welcome and appreciated. Sorry for the long rant. \n\nTLDR: I\u2019m a junior dev working at a start up with one senior architect who has no interest in explaining anything. I\u2019m lost, stressed and defeated.",

    "body":"First, I'd like to apologize for posting here and not in \/cybersecurity or related. This sub is bigger, and I feel I'll get more advice here than in a more focused sub.\n\nI graduated two years ago, no job applications put out, but I've been trying to force myself to get the hang of web and app development; basically because it's like a foundation for security. I assumed if I want to secure apps, it's best I first know how to build them, but I have no flare for web & mobile app development anymore. It's like I'm forcing myself to do something I'm not interested in. I used to like development a decade ago, but somewhere along the line the passion for it died. I can read code and understand it to an extent and research what I don't, but I don't have that drive to build any sort of web or app-store type mobile app. \n\nInstead of wasting years on a skill I'm not interested in, I'm thinking of diving into the pool I'm truly interested in; security. To be specific, the technical side of it. I'm interested in pentesting, injections, building and understanding scripts\/malwares\/ITSec-tools, cryptography (love maths), and bug hunting. \n\n- What other technical paths\/titles can I pursue in the security field? I'm not really interested in the theories of information & cyber security, but I will read up on theories that I need to. But from going through the security subs, I saw majority of the field rarely works with code. They do so mostly to create tools only. \n\n- Another thing that holds me from going into the general cyber\/network security space and kept me trying to master app and web development is freelancing. I'm not really one that enjoys office weekdays 9-5 working. That's more reason why I like penetration testing. I can work from home or as a contractor. So I would like job roles that can allow me freelance or work part time and\/or remotely.\n\nBasically, I'm tired of forcing myself to get the hang of web and app development; front end, back end, frameworks, etc. I'm tired of all that - it's annoying just to type and think about. Maybe because of how crowded and diluted the field is, to me. Either way, no desire comes from those topics. I want to transition into something still technical, but not a front-end\/back-end based development type job. I loved my cryptography course in school, although hard, it was a challenge I enjoyed. I know I'll love everything technical about cyber & network security. What are my options and paths (especially foundation) please?",

    "body":"I have an offer to start next week as a software engineer for a consultant company who have their client, pay is low -> 60k\/ year and this is the first offer I got in like 4 months of search after graduation with an Master's, international student here, so finding a company that would sponsor was also a factor. \n\nAnyways, Now I have other few interviews in the pipeline, starting this Monday, which I might or might not clear. I do have one company, let's call it 'B' where I cleared all rounds(total of 3) and waiting for the decision this coming week, my question is, if the company agrees to extend an offer hopefully, should I mention them about the offer that I have and try to negotiate for a 70k compensation package. \n\nThe average glassdoor review or new grad salary in company B is 67k, a little background about B, I really like the company and the stack that I am gonna work, but they don't provide sponsorship and I am fine with it. I strongly believe I can work there for a few months and find a job that do provide sponsorship within the end of the year. I say this because, I've been constantly applying, for months now and have fair bit of interview experience, and am financially constrained at this point to not have a job. I am not going to stop applying or interviewing in both the cases of these jobs but just wanted to make I'm thinking straight. Appreciate any help or suggestions, thank you.\n\n\nUpdate (edit) -  Got offer from B and negotiated a starting compensation of 70k+ benefits :D\n\nThank you everyone who replied to my post, really appreciate it.",

    "body":"Hi,\n\nI've joined a AI research team in a big company (transitioning internally) about a year and a half ago, and got quickly promoted to project leader of a software project that is supposed to help our research team. It makes sense from the team point-of-view because I'm the only person who could have taken that role given my experience (more real SWE experience, and also experienced working in research).\n\nRecently a brainstorming with the research team basically oriented the project toward a data processing project, which again makes sense from the team's point of view. However, for me it's depressing, I've joined the team because I'm truly passionate about ML research (although I don't have a PhD), I haven't touched a DL training for almost a year now, and this new orientation makes me think that I won't for a while.\n\nI'm still young (29y) and even tho I understand that I'm the most qualified for this role, I don't think it's the best way I can expend my career (I'm not THAT technically experienced, most of my decisions are just educated guess and take time plan, I don't have any mentoring, I'm mostly managing interns and juniors).\n\nI also don't think so far that this promotion got converted into title \/ financial raise (still not senior, even tho I've always been top contributor, and my colleague who stayed in SWE team already got promoted, and because I didn't get promoted my raise last year were imho pretty low).\n\nI'm thinking about asking for a demotion to get back into research (I do think this team is exceptionally good in AI research, so I would prefer not to move).\n\nIs this a suicidal move career-wise? Is there a better solution?\n\nOur raise process is announced in June, I should get promoted senior there (I'm not sure about how much raise), should I wait for it before doing anything?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated.",

Mostly using asp.net and c# as my chosen career. \n\nAs far as my job history goes I've only ever worked for two companies. My first job I was an intern and eventually was hired as a junior. The team was abusive and had a weird power complex situation going on, so I left after 4 years. Plus the company had been dangling the carrot oh money for a while. \n\nThis lead me to my current venture. I'm working for a marketing company and handling five projects that are core operations for the company. I am handling these ony own. I'm the only developer that works on these projects. There are two other devs working in their own projects as well. There isn't a lot of learning or anyone to help guide me career wise, but the culture is phenomenal. Needless to say, I can't grow like I should on my own. \n\nThis lands me on the phone with HR from a new company. I aced the interviews after a year of being told I wasn't good enough for positions, after having interviews with big companies like Microsoft, after being told I'm still junior level and after 6 years that's really bad. I'm taking a position as a lead software engineer with my new company at a 6 figure salary. Under the guidance of a team of 5 engineers as part of a bigger team of 18 engineers. I'm flabbergasted.\n\nIn the words of Rocky:\n\nLet me tell you something you already know. The world ain\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows. It\u2019s a very mean and nasty place, and I don\u2019t care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain\u2019t about how hard you hit. It\u2019s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That\u2019s how winning is done! Now, if you know what you\u2019re worth, then go out and get what you\u2019re worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain\u2019t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain\u2019t you. You\u2019re better than that!\n\nYou can do it you just have to not give up or settle.",

Last 10 years in a telecom\/tech company mostly focused on critical environments and automation (think data centres, etc.). Looking to move into a different part of the company focused on either AI or emerging tech or products\/services. I have 3 leads\/interviews and wanted to get your thoughts on the pros\/cons. Assume salary is same for all the positions and they are all internal transfers. Also, all are manager positions with direct reports.\n\n1. Manage a team of data scientists, software engineers, systems analysts, and business analysts spread over 3 countries to optimize and scale an AI and ML based program to reduce operating costs of the company. So in other words, automate and digitize internal processes and even customer facing troubleshooting (currently done by techs). Team is highly technical, competent, and experienced but lacks direction, role definition, and structure.\n2. Manage a team of business analysts, project managers, and program managers to identify emerging disruptive technologies in smart building and smart cities space for M&A or strategic partnership opportunities. Work is primarily focused on identification and evaluation of technologies and companies so it is pseudo technical with some business analysis. Team would be built from ground up as it is a very entrepreneurial start up environment. \n3. Manage a team of business analysts and product experts to manage product assurance after launch. So this deals with ensuring that my team works with product owners and analytic teams to develop roadmaps, strategies, and tools to increase product assurance for the end customer (general public). This includes physical and digital products (up to 20 product lines).",

I prefer research-oriented work  which involves technical challeges more than people-oriented work which invloves talking and serving people.

In this team I\u2019ve heard some feedback that I am not moving fast enough, that\u2019s because I let myself doing nothing from time to time, it is not good and I am working on it.\n\nThe salary is good for the place, for my region and my experience, it is adjusted to the local market.

The figures are not high for their market but great for mine. Tasks also seem very challenging, and here is my imposter syndrome starts doing it\u2019s job.\n\nThere is nothing to discuss about figures, they just pay a lot.

In this case I will not be able to return to my current team and probably the company that I really like. Actually, I do like my current team and it definitely will give me some precious experience if I remain here, but they will not match this offer (and even wouldn\u2019t try because I am the new guy at the team with no significant results yet).\n\nI\u2019m asking this sub to give advice on the situation and approaches to make the decision!",

I should've rescheduled the interview because I could've studied the technical stuff some more but when they asked me about how hashmaps store stuff I had no idea so that really hurt me I think. They don't teach algorithms to computer engineering majors at my school. Anyways, what should I do? My brothers a senior software engineer and he's been trying to start a small company with me but wants to work on stuff I have no experience in, I finally feel ready to try taking software seriously again it's just hard to start a company and I think an internship or job might be better for me right now.",

    "body":"Long time lurker here\n\nMy dream company to work for is Jane Street Capital in the New York office. I'm intrigued by the fact that they primarily use OCaml for the sake of code clarity and from what I know the culture seems pretty good. I do also know, however, that it's notoriously hard to get into. I'd like to know if anyone has any insight on how to maximize chances of getting in like what to put on my resume, what things to study and practice before the interview, etc.\n\nA bit about me, I'm a math major with a CS minor with 3.7 GPA from an alright-to-decent school. My work experience consists of one data science internship where I didn't do much and I currently work at Amazon and approaching the 4 year mark so I want to switch to something else once I get all my stocks. I don't really have any side projects and wouldn't call myself a super good programmer, I am only particularly comfortable in Java and Python and don't know many software engineering tools other than tools internal to Amazon. To be honest I think I lucked out on my Amazon interview because my raw programming skill is kind of weak. However I am decently good at puzzles\/riddles and so I think I can understand complicated algorithms conceptually but I would need to practice a lot to be able to code them out. I never did competitive programming or anything like that but I did well in advanced algorithms courses which were based on pseudo code and proofs and diagrams. Also, as a math major, I found big O to be pretty easy compared to the kinds of math I did in my program. I don't think I would have any trouble analyzing the run time of programs and finding places where there could be optimizations.\n\nI'd be super interested in knowing what my chances of making it to the interview are and if anyone has any ideas for things I should practice or improve on to maximize my chance of getting in. I heard that Jane Street doesn't usually interview people who failed an interview with them before and so I'd like to get it right the first time. And while I went to a pretty good school I don't think it's a target school so that also hurts my chances, and I'm not sure what their GPA cutoff is or if there even is one. But I think my math background could be appealing to them. Any advice would be super appreciated, thanks!",

I've been considering a switch to tech and am working through CS50 and then want to move onto other certifications for Linux, Networking, Systems Admin, etc. Almost every entry-level job that I'm finding is negotiable on degree and certificates, but usually requires at least 1-2 years of experience in IT settings. I know that for many jobs you can find overlaps between experience and get interviewed and even hired without having direct experience. I'm wondering if this is true for IT\/CS? I saw this job posted with the state and I'm wondering if any of my experience can be applied. Is saying that I'm working through CS50 enough? What kind of non-IT\/CS experience can qualify for the information security field?

I've tried writing scripts to make my tasks more efficient in the little time that I have and started learning Linux last year before the pandemic started. I would like to at least try to apply but asking if you have that experience is an initial qualifier\/disqualifier.

AI is the hardest brach according to older students at my uni, however I've spoken with an experienced aquaintance that has worked 20+ years (in sales, I think), we've looked at the different subjects and he says the AI ones will teach me the most and will make my curriculum more attractive. It also looks interesting in youtube videos (like CodeBullet's). However, I am scared it's too much for me as I am already having motivation issues with the core subjects these two last years.

However, I have recently received a competitive offer from a tech company based in Seattle and their offer explodes in 3 days. (They are fully aware that I recently started at another company)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe team I am on at my current company (financial one) is not legacy or boring work. I am working on features for a new financial application that will be released in the coming months. However, my onboarding has been a shitshow but it's slowly getting better... I am not sure the team knew that I was joining LOL I would say this financial company would be considered the top bank\/investment institution in the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe team at the tech company is a customer data backend-focused team. Not the most exciting team but I got the chance to actually meet the team and the hiring manager during the interviews.  The company is a not FAANG tier, but it is a company most people have heard about before and is a company you would find in Silicon Valley. The culture and team seem awesome and seem like an awesome place to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo basically if I were to leave my current company, I would be blacklisted by the financial world possibly... my question is what is best for my career? (Salary, Learning, Career Progress, etc...) My goal is to learn as much as a developer as possible to eventually start my own startup and to earn as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould greatly appreciate any advice or opinions from you guys!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

My first job was a contract job that ended because the contract ended and they didn't renew due to the company having some internal issues. I ended up leaving my next job due to wanting to work in a different technology stack. The next place I worked put me in a position where they cut my pay massively hoping I would quit so they didn't have to pay me unemployment due to me underperforming in my position and I just got let go from my job yesterday where they claimed \"the company was going in a different direction\" and they wanted more senior level developers on the team. I assume that's true, but I still get the impression they thought I might have been underperforming based on other parts of that conversation. \n\nI'm job hunting now and am trying to figure out what I should be looking for in order to work at a place long term and grow as a developer in order to fill in any possibile gaps in knowledge I have so I can improve. I'm sticking to postings that specifically say entry level or junior to be on the safe side. I have a lot of experience mainly with web technologies like html\/css\/JavaScript and PHP\/MySQL. I just spent the last year and 8 months using codeigniter at my last job and got really familiar with it, but it seems like a lot of companies are moving away from these types of frameworks and  stacks in favor of AWS services and js frameworks. I have some exposure to AWS (completed an associate solutions architect course, but haven't passed the exam yet) and have been learning Vue but don't have any production experience with it and a lot of companies are looking for 2+ years even in junior positions. I assume this is a fairly common situation to be in in, how have others death with this and how have you found your groove?",

I decided I could escape blue collar life by learning to code more professionally and I did. I got a job at a healthcare company writing SQL and SSRS reports. 3 years later I got promoted to a new position working with MS Dynamics. \n\nThe company and culture, while corporate and corny at times, is anything but toxic. I feel valued and rewarded for my hard work. Management is supportive and it\u2019s a very collaborative atmosphere. Office politics exist I\u2019m sure but I don\u2019t have to worry about them. PTO is generous and so is the pay. \n\nBut I just can\u2019t focus. I\u2019m just not interested in any of this shit. It was the same with both the SQL and dynamics positions, which as tools are both fine and kind of fun to work with, but in the context of healthcare and the corporate world I just really have trouble staying on top of all the meetings, different projects, terminology, processes, ect. I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed. I swear to god sometimes a meeting will just land on my calander with zero context and people will talk to me as if I\u2019m an expert in whatever it is they\u2019re talking about but I literally have no clue. Sometimes I ask for context beforehand and it\u2019s just more shit I don\u2019t understand. I feel like I\u2019m low IQ and just managed to charm my way into this job.\n\nI have no idea what the hell is going on most of the time and I just kind of stumble my way through everything until it\u2019s \u201cdone\u201d and either deployed or forgotten about for 3 months until it randomly comes up again. I the meantime 6 other things will be piled onto my plate. Sometimes I finish shit without understanding what I did or what it\u2019s for.\n\nMy honest feelings are that I don\u2019t give a shit about my job. I just want to develop my games but I\u2019m not naive, I know putting it all on the line in the hopes my little indie game will take off is a dumb move... I just can\u2019t stand the office life. I feel like I\u2019m so stressed out for no reason. I exercise regularly and whatnot but I feel like my body is in worse shape than when I was landscaping lol\n\nPart of me wants to go back to blue collar life and just make my games on the side, but I would need to pick up an actual trade to support the house and kids. \n\nIdk how bad did I fuck up here in going down this path?",

    "body":"I've been working in one of big companies developing custom OS for several years. My activities included developing userspace services, custom libc and some S\/W parts of the proprietary kernel. This was a job I really liked; the only reason I left it was a lack of understanding how tech processes should work. For several years, me and many my colleagues tried to change the situation, with little to no success; when most of talented colleagues left, I felt that the project stagnates, and also took an uneasy decision to leave.\n\nAnyway, even after some months passed, I feel that I really miss what I did there. I really liked the job, only political questions or absurd management made it less attractive. I would really like to find some project which is concentrated around the stuff I used to do. I'm particularly interested in concepts like capabilities, TCB, object-oriented; OSes and frameworks which attract me most include Fuchsia, Capsicum, Windows (not API-wise, though) and similar. I mostly dealt with C over these years; my C++ skills are rusty. Anyway, language is not a problem, I can learn new languages as well; I simply prefer C.\n\nAn ideal project would be:\n\n* An operating system which is aware of Orange Book and TCB, and tries to follow these principles to at least some extent.\n* Mostly userspace activities, like libc development, implementing miscellaneous services, perhaps even RPC to some degree.\n* It'd be perfect if I could operate on kernel\/userspace boundaries, e.g. implementing new system calls or other kernel<=>userspace interfaces.\n* Preferably the significant part is written in C, which I know much better than anything else; other languages are not a problem, the C is simply the favorite one.\n* The project has some space for an architect.\n* The job is remote.\n\nOf course, I realize that it's rather difficult to meet all these criteria; I mostly shown them for an illustration of what I like and prefer. I tried investigating many jobs available, but, given somewhat narrowed scope, it's difficult to find something. Most vacancies for C developer I checked deal with either firmware or hardware; whilst I'd really like to become proficient in these areas as well, I'd like to at least start with fields where I feel myself already proficient enough. That said, I'm OK to use languages other than C, and participate in projects which deal with other userspace parts; above is an ideal image of the world, I realize it's close to impossible to find something that specific.\n\nI'm struggling to find something which matches my interests, and would be glad for any tip. Finding a job which matches these criteria via search engines is difficult, if not impossible, but perhaps real people can give me an advice?\n\nUPD: I also should mention that quite a lot of my activities recently concerned taking architectural solutions, publishing designs on implementations and similar actions.",

My Chinese is getting a bit rusty so I might have missed a few details, but this seems to be what happened: \n\nThere's this intern from Peking University who worked Jan - Apr and told her leader that she wants to leave in April because they're busy with graduating. The leader said no because she didn't find a replacement for her position and told her to keep working. After May 1st, a junior of the leader's joined the team, so OP wrote a 10,000 character transitional document and asked to quit on May 11th again, but the leader said that OP still couldn't leave because the backup wasn't found by the OP. On top of that, the leader said to OP that their working skills are really bad and they have to find two backups (replacements) to fill the holes in her work and questioned OP why they couldn't find a replacement when everyone else could. \n\nOP's post then goes into detail about legality (no mention of needing to find a replacement before leaving), violence at the workplace (OP's roommate's leader told the roommate that \"leaving without finding a replacement is irresponsible\", and when OP brought this issue to HR, HR said that OP was arguing about semantics \/ denying that the leader had said such a thing), why they needed two backups (was she doing two people's work?), and double standards (a roommate of hers didn't need to find a backup to leave, so why would she need to?). \n\nHope we can have a discussion about this here.\n\nEDIT: Sorry about using \"she\" in the title. Not too sure about OP's gender.",

    "body":"&#x200B;\n\nHey. I graduated from university a year ago and have been working for a year as a back-end engineer. I was applying during peak COVID so I took the first decent job I found. The work is ok for me (I like designing APIs), the people are great, the work-life balance is impeccable but for my experience and skillset, I'm being grossly underpaid ($72k\/y +8k bonus) (HCOL).\n\n I don't think there is much room for working on newer projects at my current company (cut and dry, develop this feature, fix this bug, etc).  I very much want to leave for a company that will pay me more, and allow me to work with engineers that I can learn from. The only redeeming quality about this company is that I only have to work like \\~15h a week MAX. No micromanaging.\n\nI know that I'm being underpaid, so I've been grinding LC for the past 3 months and I'm making steady progress. I've been taking all the SWE interviews I can get just for the practice and recently I've been offered a glorified Sales Engineer job. The comp is \\~120K + 15-20k bonuses. This is basically 50K more than I make now. The role doesn't sound very appealing, but from what I can gather they want someone to come to develop tools and scripts to automate their demo environment (so there would be some SWE). \n\nRegardless, I would still keep grinding LC if I took this job because I don't want to end up in the sales engineering world. **Will taking this job hurt my ability to pivot back to a pure SWE role?**  Would you give up insane WLB + vacation days for 50K for a temporary role as a sales engineer?\n\nRight now I'm still confused. An extra (50k \/ y) would be extremely great, I just don't want to hurt my ability to get back into an SWE role... \n\nAlso, this company I'm currently at is working at knows I want a raise, and I've been vocal about it but I'm met with nothing but lip service.\n\nTLDR: \n\noption A: stay at current company, maybe get a 10-15k raise within the year, continue to work on CRUD APIs but not work with newer tech stacks \/ develop my skills that much.\n\noption B: go to company B, make $50k more at least, and do something I also don't particularly enjoy, that moves outside of the SWE world, and continue to study.",

    "body":"Hi all, I was very fortunate to begin a new grad job eight months ago on a team that develops a popular cloud-based product. My manager and teammates are great and I get along very well with everyone. I use a modern, in-demand tech stack and am paid well above market rate. With that said, my time here has been extremely challenging. I work longs hours yet am doing much less coding than I anticipated. The breakdown is approximately:\n\n30% \u2014 Development. We do not have dedicated QA or ops teams, so a good portion of this time is spent either testing or handling build\/deployment issues.\n\n25% \u2014 Docs, investigations, proposals, etc. Every change at this company requires time-consuming processes and external approval.\n\n20% \u2014 On-call activities. We have frequent week-long stretches of 24 hour on-call where getting multiple pages per day is the norm. We are expected to work a backlog of on-call-related tasks when not actively working a page, so I do not touch code while on-call.\n\n15% \u2014 Monotonous, repetitive tasks. This includes enabling feature flags and manual testing for things that we cannot automate.\n\n10% \u2014 Meetings.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how normal this is for a junior, but I suspect it is not normal at all.\n\nI have discussed the issue with my manager multiple times. He pays lip service to correcting the imbalance but I feel that I am stuck in an endless cycle of activities that are not enriching my skill-set as a developer. I have some interesting projects lined up but they require many hours of investigation and proposals before I\u2019ll touch any code.\n\nMy biggest concern is that my experience looks good on paper but, in reality, is lacking. Future employers may expect more from me than I am capable of delivering, given my sub-par experience at my current job.\n\nI am not sure how long I will stay with this company; I am in my 30s and want something more laid back and without so much on-call. However, I worry about leaving my first job too soon and how this may be perceived by future employers.\n\nIs this what modern software development is like at big companies? Am I doing something wrong? Is there anything I can do to improve my situation?\n\nAny feedback is very much appreciated.\n\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone who has replied so far. The responses have helped me to shift my perspective and view my experience more positively.",

    "body":"Hello guys, I guess I also have some additional questions too. \n\nSo I have been working at this financial firm as a contractor the past 2 years (first job) and recently they have extended me an offer to become a full time employee. \n\nWe had been using waterfall so basically we would have a bundle every 3 months, I got used to that and it worked fine, that gave me a lot of time to research and be able to code everything before the deadline comes up. \n\nA month ago we switched to agile, we have two weeks sprints now, and also I have switched to another team so the projects are all kinds new to me. \n\nI'm just feeling a bit overwhelmed and starting to feel \"guilty\" for not being fast enough, we have many meetings during the week and while I communicate fine and I'm very professional I feel bad that my whole team are way smarter than me, granted I am the only junior Dev and they are all seniors, but I feel like overall I'm slow and like 10 mins in during a technical meeting I get pretty lost, while the rest of the team keep talking very technical until the meeting is done, it doesn't help that I have ADHD too lol but I am taking meds and they are helping a bit. \n\nI would say overall, I have not received any negative feedback from either my managers or my colleagues, in fact both of them recommended me and spoke great things about me, but I have this crippling feeling that I just keep getting \"lucky\" and I will very soon be \"exposed\" and then crash and burn. \n\nAnd ever since I started working from home last year this feeling had been getting worse, I always feel like I'm deceiving everyone around me and I'm not smart or good as they think I am. I guess this is all caused by years of being in the engineering school and building the imposter syndrome, and having to be like that for all those job interviews. \n\nI also think ever since I started working from home I keep having the urge to log in to my work laptop again after work hours, I really don't feel \"done\" for the day if that makes sense. \n\nAnyone dealt with those issues before? And how did you overcome them? \n\nThanks !",

I kept seeing emails about the new \"DC office\" and how they were targeting that area.\n\nThe listings for their jobs that were remote shrank significantly and they are all targeted towards Washington, DC now. I didn't think much of this until I started seeing engineer after engineer leave. 4 people from my small team left in a month along with other big time departures like the president of the company. It was very hush hush as to why  they departed and they all \"left on good terms\". \n\nSo then I see some Glassdoor reviews pop up, and they keep saying the same thing: the new CEO wants people to move and work out of DC and that's why people are leaving. Well, I live in Phoenix so there is no fucking way I'm going to move my entire family to DC out of the blue. \n\nMy manager hasn't said a thing about this to me, but I keep getting emails talking about DC and people leaving.

Drop everything and work on it.\n\nManager #2: We need this work done ASAP. Drop everything and work on it.\n\nMe: I have critical task for manager #1. It may take me longer for this task.\n\nManager #2: No this is more important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth projects, I am the only contributor in the repo and me & manager are only one who are familiar with business rule so passing it off to someone else will be difficult. It's a fairly small shop.",

Everytime someone mentions outsourcing here it seems like it is the worst think that a company can do, like it is the beginning of the end for a good place to work. \n\nI'm asking because I work for a consulting company in south America (imagine Accenture, but smaller) that offers its services to US companies, and honestly it seems to work quite well.

Getting a paid position in my first year means a lot to me, as all my work seems to have paid off, but right now I'm dealing with a lot of anxiety. I don't know react. The interview from this company was mostly them asking about my hackathon projects and about box model and flex box stuff. Nothing that I consider part of a \"technical interview\". I feel like I don't deserve my place there, and as the date of the internship is approaching, me receiving my work laptop , I'm feeling more and more as an intruder. I knew the company beforehand, and their techstack and projects are so appealing to me, but I just can't help feeling like this.  \n\n\nHow can I make this feeling go away?

    "body":"Hello,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I have made some mistakes in my career, luckily I think they have been early enough is isn't to late to try and salvage the situation. I am curious to hear everyone's take on what is going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was working at a fairly large military contractor for last part of my schooling, and worked full time for a year (graduated in April). So started in Jan of last year and left in Feb. This job was great actually really enjoyed it, there was those days where I hated it but for the most part everyone was super collaborative, interesting work, modern stack, and not much to complain about. Then they started doing restructuring they ended up selling my team   to another company, got put on a new team, then that new team started getting dissolved, and I basically was unsure about my job and what was really going on. In addition to every thing that was going on after talking to other friends I realized I was getting pretty underpaid compared to market value for the area, I was getting paid 72k, and most places were 80-90.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now, I took a new job that is fully remote (it's local but they gave me the option to work remote), the job paying a lot better $110, which honestly probably is way to much, but hey they offered it.  However that is where this drama just barely starts. So this job has a TON of technical debt, more so then what they originally told me.  They have a backlog of almost a year plus worth of bugs, angular 8, and what not.  With this technical debt there are lot of bugs (I would say 70% of backlog items), many of which aren't even fixable with current stack, or super hard to trouble shoot.   \n\n\nAs we fix issues there is no current process to really test against production environment, and QA testers also are stuck with half testing it. So with that we fix things and it introduces other small things, or maybe it wasn't possibly fixed. Which is fine, but it is difficult cause all of these come back to look like its my fault.. Which our team is really small its me and one other guys (which doesn't do a ton). But lately I feel like everything has been a complete mess, and everyone is playing the blame game, and complaining stuff is not getting done fast enough. Which is the furthest from the truth. Which I think my manager would back me up, but I can tell hes starting to get frustrated with everything that is going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that I have started to document every single thing I'm working on, what I found, who I worked with, just if something was to hit the fan. But I  basically am worried that based off past stories I have heard one day I will just go in and they will let me go. (I guess they dont usually hire full time (as I am), looking at the company states 80% of work force is contracted employees) Which this was my worry all along because I know looking like a job hopper is not good. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are plenty of other stuff going on with the company, which honestly is just shady (they've been lying to 3rd parties, and I have to say stuff particular way or they get stuck paying more money). Just to list a few..  I'm worried if I'm let go it basically sets me up for a super bad looking resume and 100% a job hopper.... Feel like it's a touch situation to be in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAppreciate any insights\/experiences you may have had.",

    "body":"Hi Redditors, I ran into the strangest situation this week and am looking for some thoughts and advice on what to do.\n\n**TL;DR:** As a contractor, I applied for an internal FTE position for the same role under my current manager that I was basically told I would for sure get. After my interviews and all positive feedback from them, recruiting won't move forward with my application. Could the recruiter have something against me or a vested interest to hire external candidates?\n\nDetails:\n\nI'm currently work as a contractor at a fairly large tech company via a consulting company. There's an opening for a full time position on my team for the same role that I'm working in now. (FYI, it's not SDE but similar.) I joined late last year and am doing well, so my manager (who's also the hiring manager for the position) recommended me to apply. Unfortunately, since it's a bigger company with a lot of rules, there's no simple conversion from contractor to FTE - I have to go through the full interview process. My manager basically told me this would just be a formality and my interviews would mostly be with people on our team whom I already work with.\n\nI finished all the interviews and got positive feedback during all of them. After a week, I asked my manager if there any updates and he said he hasn't heard from recruiting. So I reached out to recruiting asking when I can expect to hear and they said they're still debriefing other candidates and will get back to me when that's done.\n\nThe thing is, it's kind of strange but I was also asked to help out as interviewer for the same position that I am applying to since there are two FTE positions open for this role. Since I'm the only person doing this work right now on the team and whoever else we hire will be working closely with me, my manager wanted me to be an interviewer. So I interviewed a couple other candidates the same week I had my own interview. Recruiting held a debrief session with the interviewers - including me - and the candidates got the decisions within 3 days after their interviews. We didn't hire them. (Btw, I'm not involved as an interviewer anymore, because recruiting found out that I was a contractor and there is some rule that contractors can't be interviewers for FTE positions.)\n\nSo now it's been \\~2 weeks after my own interviews and I still haven't heard anything. I asked my manager about this again today. He said he's asked recruiting several times to move forward with setting up the debrief meeting for me, but that they \"seemed to be ignoring his requests.\" He told me that even though recruiting doesn't have a say in who gets hired, he is dependent on them to coordinate the process.\n\nI wonder why this recruiter assigned to me is refusing to move forward with my application? I haven't talked to them in person outside of a couple email exchanges, all very brief and polite from both sides. Even the initial \"recruiter screen\" and scheduling the interviews were done by other people. So I don't think they have anything against me personally, but perhaps they have a vested interest to hire the candidates that are sourced\/introduced by them? Has anyone heard of this happening?\n\nWhat should I do in this situation?? Can this recruiter actually block me from being hired? At this rate, they will continue delaying my application while they continue bringing in new candidates. And I'll be forced to extend my contract after it ends next month (and obviously, not guaranteed that I can continue extending in the future) and miss out on this FTE opening.",

    "body":"Hello, I'm a junior dev at a start up company. I recently started questioning myself whether \"making things work first, then deal with issues later\" is a good mindset or not. From my little experience, I feel like my team tends to create things without deep analysis or designing\/architecting and without much consideration on what would potentially come up next. Just get things done first for customer, and deal with the rest later. For e.g. design a db in a way that it leverages the existing code as much as possible to get things done on time. Now a year later, it became a performance bottleneck, and the code is already coupled enough. It has grown a lot and become risky to make big changes. And fixing bugs\/issues from it is becoming really stressful for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where my question started. I wonder if this is the best way to deal with the things and if it's really true that we don't need to build \"future\" now. Can you guys share your experience?

And quite honestly, I'm not as smart as those kids who taught themselves to code at 11 years old and got 6-figure jobs without going to school. Not down playing myself, just a fact that I'm not that gifted at programming or tech related things like I am with HVAC or Music(also self taught)\nI do appreciate the advice and encouragement to try though!

In fact, I would have liked to take a job there, but it didn't pan out. I am grateful that working there opened my eyes to the management side of development.\n\nLater on for my capstone project, my professor had us split up into teams of 10 and create a fake startup based on a skeleton of an app he gave us. I decided to take a swing at being the Scrum Master. I really liked the role, and the instructor told me that I should go get a Scrum Master Certification. My question is, isn't the Scrum Master role usually reserved for after someone is a senior developer? Would anyone hire me to be an agile coach at a company where most of the people will be older than me? Should I just spend a few years in the field first? \n\nI'm posting here because I know I'm not a star coder (I barely touch my leetcode account), but I spent a lot of time in my college career being a leader in different organizations on campus and mentoring freshman students.

The main programming languages that I used in college were Python and Java, so I'm a tad concerned that Perl is no longer what employers are looking for. \n\nShould I do side projects in other programming languages to \"stay relevant\" while I use Perl at work?

But, I'm also in the matching stage between passing the hiring committee and receiving an offer from a FAANG company. I don't know if I can\/should share names or not.\n\nI'm pretty set on taking the first offer because of location. The problem is, the matching process is gonna take longer than the offer deadline. Should I continue through with the FAANG company to get an offer? \n\nI can either get an extension, which then creates a time pressure situation, or I can just sign and continue with FAANG quietly until I actually get the offer. Then I could potentially negotiate higher.\n\nThoughts?",

I've read articles, watched videos, and a lot of people have different experiences with internships. Some are Freshman and somehow land a QA Analyst role. I see stories of Juniors who got an 'in' as a Software Dev Intern at relatively decent companies, and seniors getting FAANG internships. And, of course, the people who got internships when they graduated at companies to start building up their resume.\n\nI'm not sure when to start looking. I'm not sure if I should have my degree nearly done to start looking. Are there specific classes I need done before I do an internship? Should I have a full, presentable portfolio to be 'ready'? Some internship postings have some requirements, but a lot of them are not specific on what they're looking for.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts or your personal experience with this.",

I've never gone internal before, but I know that companies tend to pay a bit more to secure contractors than they do for their FTE's, and my understanding is that it has a lot to do with not offering full benefits and also the fees they pay to the W2 company of the contractor and all that.\n\nThe company in question contracts my services through an implementation partner, and that partner contracts me from my W2 employer. \n\nI know what I'm making as a contractor, and roughly speaking the amount that flows to my W2 employer before I get my cut. In terms of compensation, is it generally fair to ask for the same amount that went to the W2 (which would be a raise for me), or is it more reasonable to ask for less or the same as what I'm making? It's gonna be a negotiation, but I'd like to come with a reasonable starting number in case I lead. \n\nI've been in the industry for about 6 years now, but have always been on contract (besides when I was an intern years ago), and they're a well off company which values me as an employee.

So I'm a new grad who's been applying to places for a while and I've only started the interview process and haven't gotten an offer yet but I just wanted to ask you guys for your opinion. I guess I'll just list out the pros and cons and general thoughts. Also if it matters, I'm in Canada.\n\nSo on one hand, the pay is very very good, especially for a junior swe position without much experience. The only experience I have is doing a bit of freelancing stuff while I was in university. On the other hand, it's only an 8 month or so long position with the possibility of an extension afterwards. This is the main thing that's bothering me because I know that it's basically all about getting that first position and having like 2 years under your belt and it gets easier from there so I was hoping to land a good job for 2 years and try to get into some FAANG type company. With it being a government job, I've also heard it's kind of slow paced and boring but obviously there's various departments and the requirements were pretty new tech (which I've used and am comfortable with) so maybe that won't be the case. I'm also definitely a night owl and was hoping to join a tech company with flexible hours if possible but that's definitely the least of my worries.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty sure I should take the offer if given to me, but I would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThanks!",

    "body":"I'm the lead engineer on a small team at a non-tech company (I refer to my work as \"enterprise software development\"). It's just me and a few juniors. My boss is an architect, kind of. I'll also add that I'm a decent developer, but by no means am I \"FAANG-worthy\".\n\nI've really enjoyed my job up until recently. I've had agency to implement things however I want, and I took that opportunity to make sure we were doing everything in a forward-thinking and well thought-out way, even if that meant taking a few hours\/days to try a few things out. By doing this, I learned a lot and even got to build some really neat solutions to problems we encountered while trying to build as smartly as possible.\n\nSome time ago, our CTO decided he wanted our company to be more tech-focused, and chose my boss's team to sort of spear-head this move. Since then, a lot of what we've been developing has been proofs of concept for different business-units, who are used to finding external vendors for technical needs. There was, understandably, considerable push-back to a lot of our work, because change isn't easy--it never is.\n\nThis sort of came to a head a few weeks ago when I was working on a 1-2 week PoC for some business unit (important information: we're a global company, so sometimes there's a language barrier when speaking with other business units). Throughout the development process I kept my boss informed. I told him what I understood the problem to be and how I planned to implement it. I then had him test it out and give me feedback so that I could make it really clean for the inevitable demo to the business unit who asked for it. He was on board... Until the day of the demo. We met (via zoom) to dry-run the demo and he told me, more or less, that in all of his conversations with the requesting business unit he'd never heard them complain about what my PoC aimed to solve, that he wasn't sure the product demo was going to go over well because of that. I was, I think understandably, upset. I asked him why he had approved of me working on this, why I hadn't gotten this feedback earlier, etc. and he just said \"I made a mistake\". Needless to say, the demo went poorly.\n\nThis is one instance, but we've been running into this similar issue (the poor demos, not the miscommunications) for a while and it's got me questioning my role at this company. Aside from this, I've been realizing lately that I have only been learning as much as I have because I chose to. There's not really anyone technical enough around me to give me feedback on my methods or talk through alternative options. Nobody would know if I built stuff in a shitty way, and that *feels* like a yellow, if not red, flag.\n\nThe relationship I have with my boss, which used to be very amicable and relatively close, has been strained by these turns of events, and the stress of work has started to bleed into my not-at-work life (I'm remote, so it's a figurative not-at-work).\n\nFinally, on Monday my boss told me I needed to let a few other folks (who I don't know and have never worked with) have access to our cloud-provider account (like, give them permission to create resources & all that). I asked him what sort of governance we were putting in place to make sure that nothing got out of hand, because it's my role to monitor our cloud-resources and when something's fishy, security comes after me, not him. He said, basically, that we can trust these folks, they're superior to me, etc. and that if security hassled me, I should just refer them to him instead. This feels messy and like it's just asking to be a pain in my neck long term.\n\nIs it time to start polishing my resume? Am I over-reacting? If I leave, it's just a bunch of juniors and an architect, and nobody really knows what we have other than myself (I keep our documentation available to everyone, but that doesn't mean they use it). The juniors would have no mentor and the architect hasn't written code in I don't know how long. I'm not, like, emotionally invested in the success of my employer, so leaving wouldn't really bother me, but I'm sort of at the point in my life where I'd like a \"career position\" so I wouldn't have to shop around for raises & whatnot every few years as is the norm in the tech world. Any advice is welcome.",

As the title says, I will be starting my internship for a software engineering position this upcoming Monday but have recently developed a wandering left eye (strabismus) due to poor vision or partial vision in my left eye. I have a brain tumor which has caused me to have bad vision in both of my eyes for the past 4-5 years but my brain definitely has favored my right eye over my left eye. Whenever I focus on things my left eye drifts down. It only happens when I focus on things hard. If I am talking to someone or moving it isn\u2019t apparent and doesn\u2019t drift down. My question is should I tell my employer so they can accommodate for me(like bigger screen, use bigger font on programs, etc) when I start on Monday during orientation?

I have a relatively firm understanding of how operating systems work and how to utilize some technical features. \n* I don't have a history of being very good at math, but that could be due to the quality and\/or lack of teaching on the subject. \n* I have a lot of free time.  \n\n\nQuestions I have:\n\n* My brother is an IT Director and therefor has friends in the industry, but too busy to answer many questions.

    "body":"I remember lurking here last year around this time desperately looking for advice, so for anyone in that situation here is a feel good story about how things can change. \n\nI graduated in May 2020 just when corona was in full swing. I had around 100 application out at the time just shotgunning for an entry level job, and got 2 responses back both negative. Everyone dropped their summer programs, like half of my college friends were fired from their internships before the first day. For a few months I bounced between doing resume stuffer projects and sending out applications. I was approaching around 200 applications total when I finally got a response from some IT contract position at the local school system. This was really sub-optimal but at this point I was desperate and was willing to work anywhere as long as it was with a computer. It was a good temporary job but I was really dissatisfied with it since the work was repetitive and really easy, not to mention the poor pay. I started applying more on linked in near the end of the contract, and by some miracle an honest-to-goodness software role wanted an interview with me. The interview was almost devoid of technical questions, was obviously just a means for the contracting agency to steal someone's paycheck, and I was hired within 3 days. The pay was not great but is was enough to where I could pay rent and get by. Fast forward 5 months of working remotely doing interesting but underpaid work and developing my stack, some college buddies recommended I try messaging a recruiter for a growing fintech company in my area. About a month of pestering the recruiter finally got me a interview, and I passed with flying colors. Now I have a full-time career with perfectly acceptable pay for a newish grad with great benefits. \n\nLesson being: life is shitty and unfair but if you keep trying you can get lucky and land a career starter. \n\nProgress overview:\n\n\\- 5\/2020 with a BA in CS from UNC-CH\n\n\\- 5\/2020-8\/2020: no job and on the application\/learning grind\n\n\\- 8\/2020-11\/2020: contract helpdesk job at local school 15\/hr\n\n\\- 12\/2020-5\/2021: low wage contract research dev with the government 22\/hr\n\n\\- 5\/2021-present: average entry-level software dev job in fintech with average entry-level software job wage for the area 35\/hr\n\nKeeping the jobs I have secret for anonymity but feel free to AMA.

The first one I accepted a longgggg time ago (6 months ago) because they only gave me about 2 weeks to accept it, but I knew I wanted to keep looking for a better opportunity. Fast forward to last week I got another offer! I like this one a lot more but they're paying me one dollar less. So I asked them if they could potentially match the first one's offer. I sent them screenshots of the offer letter (with the acceptance deadline not in the screenshot). The recruiter said she would talk to the hiring manager. 3 days later she emails back saying she has feedback from the hiring manager and would like to discuss.\n\nNOW IM SCARED because will they find out I already ACCEPTED the first offer??? And was planning on rescinding if I get any more offers? Like what if they called the other company or something and asked them if I accepted their offer or if I haven't yet. HELP",

I thought the raise was a little weak, around 9%. I went from around 77K to 84K in a MCOL city. I decided to see what I am worth else where.\n\nI was able to get an offer for $100K for another mid level position. I like really like my company, at least more than the one I have the offer from. Both have good vacation, company retreats, paid training, maternity\/paternity leave(not worried about this). Both are private companies that are profitable. Also both are fullstack positions. Here are some differences:\n\nCurrent company: $84300\n\n* Health benefits day 1\n   * but a $400\/m cost for PPO for my partner and I\n      * partner will be getting an job in September so this will go down to $130 soon\n   * dental is around $30\/m (will go down in Sept as well)\n   * vision is a cost too but I don't use it\n* 3 weeks of vacation, 3 personal days (was given an extra week off in 2020 and 2021)\n* the week between Christmas and new years off\n* 401k Match up to 5%\n* bonus around 10%\n* raises seem weak. I got 3% after 6 months and a promotion was only 9%\n* HR and CEO control salaries\n\nNew Company: $100000\n\n* Health benefits on day 60 ( I would HAVE to negotiate this to day 1 to even take this position)\n   * dental, vision and level 1 of health care is on them for my partner and I\n   * I can pay for more health coverage if we need it\n* unlimited PTO\n* No 401K =(\n* average bonus is 3.8% (a little low)\n* raises are better 5%-10%\n* CTO is a partner and has more control over salaries\n\nI think I want to stay with my current company. I like what I work on and the people I work with. Not offering insurance on Day 1 and no 401K seems like a red flag to me on the new company.\n\nHow can I use this offer to negotiate with my current company? I want to seem appreciative but I also want to be paid what I am worth. How do I approach my manager about it even though he has little control over this? His manager has more control, should I just go straight to him or is that wrong to go over his head?\n\nAny advice is appreciated.\n\nTLDR; got an offer from another company with a 20% increase. I want to stay at my company. how do I leverage that with my current company to get a raise?",

    "body":"Hey guys, I'm finding myself in a weird spot in my career, and struggling to figure out how to move forward.\n\nFor context, I graduated in 19, and I've been working at one company since graduating.\n\nI work for a consulting firm in the Midwest. I know it's not the most glamorous job, but the pay and benefits were competitive for the area and at the time location was really important to me.\n\nShortly after I started working, someone requested that I transfer into their department with the promises of being able to work on exciting technologies and expand my skill set, in addition to being 100% remote. This obviously appealed to me so I signed on.\n\nThe reality of it was that the team that was being put together failed to sign a single contract. So, I was assigned to a project in the meantime to ensure I was billing hours. That project was a small dumpster fire, and was entirely ETL and SQL work.\n\nAfter a few months it was obvious that the project was not advancing my career. I wasn't learning new languages, new skills, or improving the ones I already had. I was working with legacy \"code\", and the client was not interested in improvements or optimizations. They just wanted the product to work, and pay as little as possible to maintain it. There was no incentive for me to learn how to improve or optimize the work I was doing as a result, and I didn't have the budget to explore those things even if I wanted to. Something to consider is that because of the projects problems I got a ton of experience working directly with clients, managing and deciding on budgets, resolution times ,etc. I did a lot of the work of the PM in this role, as our PM took a backseat on a lot of this work. I consider this to be great experience, even though it was stressful at the time, but I'm not sure how to leverage it when searching for jobs.\n\nA few months ago, my boss left our department despite never fulfilling his promises on the kind of work I'd be a part of. I really feel like this has set me back in a huge way.\n\nRecently I was transferred away from that project onto another project that is entirely SQL work. This is despite the fact that I've been very vocal about my concerns as regarding my career development.\n\nI have a bachelor's in CS and an OCA certification for Java, but it's been nearly two years since I've written real code. What do I need to learn\/do to start putting myself in a position that I will be a competitive candidate for a role where I'll get to do what I actually want to do?\n\nMy interest right now is in full stack development, but I'm open to anything that really requires me to think and optimize and improve my work. Problem solving is what I love about this field, so if anyone has any other suggestions I'm all ears.\n\nI love working with backend languages like python, java, and C++, but recently I've been trying my hand at Javascript and found that to be pretty enjoyable too.\n\nI did create a small website using one of the main frameworks years ago, that had a front end\/back end that worked and was hosted by a hosting service, so I know I can do it. But it's been so long that I can't quite remember the steps I need to take \n\nI'm currently taking an online course on Javascript (udemy) to try to get a really deep understanding of the language before I try my hand at properly learning a framework. My HTML and CSS skills are terrible (right now, but I'm sure I can improve with some elbow grease).\n\nI am moving closer to a larger city (30 min drive) so hopefully my options for employers will greatly expand once I make the move.\n\nIf anyone has any advice at all, I'd love to hear it. For anyone who made it this far, thanks so so much for taking the time.\n\n\nTL:DR; How do I transition from a primarily SQL based role into literally anything else where I get to write real code.",

    "body":"TL;DR: I've been transitioning to programming just from my own self-studying and guidance from my mentor, and I just wanted to get some feedback since I've been getting very antsy about securing a job. I have about 8 months of informal experience working with JavaScript\/React, although I've been doing an internship for a month so far at a brand new start-up working on the MVP for a React chat app. Can I get a full-time (ideally tech) job with this kind of background? Any tips on how I can make that happen? I do have a mechanical engineering degree and some years of experience there, but yeah trying to switch to coding, which so far I like a lot better.\n\nFull background:\n\nI started learning JavaScript basics at the beginning of 2020 to get ready for a coding boot camp, but then the whole pandemic thing happened and I felt less inclined to do the boot camp's remote program. Fortunately, I had a close friend who's a Software Engineer and also had prior experience teaching at a boot camp, and he offered to teach me personally as my mentor. He put together his own curriculum tailored for me based on what he thought would be most beneficial, starting with some cs fundamentals, then more web fundamentals, and then finally putting together an actual web application with React. I spent a lot of time building it under his guidance, really making sure to have a polished final product for my portfolio and resume (you can check it out here if you like: [https:\/\/www.rolemate.io](https:\/\/www.rolemate.io\/jobs))\n\nWith that experience, I was fortunately able to get a Software Engineering internship at a startup, where we're working on the very early stages of an app creating the MVP for a social app. It's been pretty good React experience as well as I've been working on new features with the guidance of the Senior Software Engineer.\n\nAnd of course, I've also been practicing with algorithms (my least favorite part) with an online course and just grinding away on different problems and mock interviews. This part is probably my weakest area and I'm still struggling to get solutions consistently.\n\nAnd that's pretty much where I'm at. I've been sending out a BUNCH of applications but haven't gotten a single response besides the internship. Is there any hope for me with my unconventional background??

Did you have any prior education before the bootcamp?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that's pretty much it for my questions. Thanks!",

    "body":"This was pretty hard to admit to myself. I started working in this field around 5-6 years ago, and finished uni 2 years ago. Currently I'm working at one of the best companies in my city, meaning I get to work with the best people in this field. I'm pretty good at what I do, at least according to my performance reviews. From the outside, everything about my career seems perfect, I got promoted almost every year, and I get paid really well with stock options.\n\nHowever, lately I've been having my doubts. I don't really consider myself an extremely extrovert person, but whenever I don't meet someone for 24 hours my mood falls down significantly. I love talking to other people, getting to know other people, travelling, and in general I like to be on the move all the time. I just hate being in one place. Even when I was working in an office I used to go to different floors all the time with my laptop to work in different places. If I could I'd rather move to a different country every year.\n\nThe best time of my career was when travel was still allowed and I could travel to different cities within my company to help other teams there. There I could meet new people, talk with them to get to know what their problem was, go for drinks with them after work, and travel. I enjoyed this phase of my career the most!\n\nI'm still trying to figure out what I want from life, but I'm pretty sure if I keep doing what I'm doing I'll go crazy. Don't get me wrong, I love programming and there's a reason why I got into this field, but I can't sit in front of a computer for 8 hours a day without much social interaction. The best part of a day for me is when we have meetings, or when I get to pair-code with someone, or when we finally go for lunch where we talk with each other. As a sidenote, I also used to be a bartender during my high school years and I really liked the way there was always something to do, always some important issue to resolve, etc.\n\nTherefore, I guess my main question is, do you know of any role in this\/any other industry where my software engineering skills would be useful while I could also do what I love doing the most: talking to people, working on different projects, and travelling?",

    "body":"Hello people of r\/cscareerquestions,\n\nI recently accepted an offer for network support engineer internship (virtual) @ meraki. During the short call, the recruiter went over the usual stuff such as compensation and timeframe. One thing that stuck out to me was that meraki sends you the equipment straight to your house which includes a laptop along with meraki stuff.\n\nFor those redditors who have virtually interned as NSE's before, do you get to keep the equipment after the internship ends?\n\n Judging from all the money that meraki throws at you, I am assuming that they might as well let the interns keep all that stuff for themselves, but that was the one question that I did not want to ask.\n\nTL;DR: If you are a virtual intern, do you get to keep all the equipment that meraki sends you after the internship ends?",

I just don't want to spend my life chasing after money like a slave and actually spend time with my family and pursuing my hobbies.\n\nHow difficult is it being a Software Engineer?

I've been taking CE courses for a bit over a year now with the goal of getting a software engineering certification from the university I'm attending.\n\nEverything I've learned so far in the 3-4 classes I've taken has been restricted to a single coding language. I've chosen Python. I've come a long way and it's been a challenge getting as far as I have. I'm confident in my Python skills and know that I can program pretty much anything the language allows me to if I can do a bit of research. \n\nBut then I go to look for requirements for entry-level software engineers. And programming in a single language is 1\/10th of the requirements they're looking for. Most want you to be familiar with full-stack design. Comfortable in multiple languages. Familiar with both scripting and compiled languages. Proficient in databases. Networking. Familiar with a bunch of third-party tools that I've never heard of like WireShark or SoapUI.\n\nIt's so incredibly demotivating. It feels like I spent the last year and a half checking off ONE of TEN boxes that employers want in an entry-level employee. Is this normal? Should I be approaching it a different way? I'll be out of a job in January and was hoping to make the jump at that time. But it feels like I won't be ready for another ten years.",

    "body":"Hello, I come with an unusual question \/ scenario and was looking to get some advice or information from people who are in the field.\n\nI'm 23 and about to graduate with a CS degree and a 3.2 GPA from a decent university. I really like C# and .NET and have several webapps out there that I designed, built and deployed by myself(Including one that makes me a little $$!). I have a decent resume and would consider myself to be a proficient programmer who has enough full stack projects out there to let a potential employer know I'm a good candidate.\n\nI'll skip the pity stories because no one gives a shit, but I didn't have it easy growing up and often turned to trolling and being a piece of shit online for entertainment when I was a teen, it was the best form of attention I could get at the time. I used to bait people on reddit, twitter, and other social medias and say some dumbass shit, I loved the thrill of seeing just how many angry replies I could get and how angry people would get at me. This all took place when I was ages 15-18. \n\nI made the foolish mistake of trusting a good IRL friend of mine with this knowledge of my shit past and about 3 years ago we had a falling out and he doxxed me hard on social media. The logs and things that he posted weren't the most obscene things on this earth, but it did paint me as a very shitty, racist, ignorant person, even though I know for a fact that I never truly believed those things and was just memeing and trolling like an idiot.\n\nI could write for hours about all the things I lost because of it, but I don't want to bore everyone. I lost some old friends and my girlfriend had to disassociate herself with me for good, that one stung the most and still does to this moment.\n\nFast-forward to 3 years later, I've lost a lot of weight, been to therapy and can confidently say that I'm no longer that type of person at all, inside and out. I look back at those years with disgust. The original \"doxxing\" thread is now deleted. The comments on the thread are still there, and when you google my name, one of these comments comes up. It isn't a good look, but it's a lot better than before. I've tried many ways to see if the original doxx thread is archived anywhere but as far as I can tell it isn't (It definitely is somewhere out there, but it looks like it isn't traceable\/ easily found)\n\nSo, as I begin to look for a start to my career, I wonder if it's even worth it to press forward, knowing that inevitably someone from HR or a team member or recruiter is gonna google my name and see those two comments labeling me as a piece of shit, It's only a comment or two, so there is a ton of plausible deniability with there being no concrete logs linking to my name. I can't have any social media anymore, as it would most likely just get harassed and to be honest I have no desire to maintain a social media presence at all, is this going to be a problem for your average company? Should I just own up to everything if ever asked? \n\nI'm sorry for writing this cringe, pathetic thread, and I'm sure that many reading this will say that I don't deserve to have a career of any sorts, and I can understand your position if this is the case. This is something that has consumed my life for several years now and has drove me to the brink of suicide and back several times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks",

I didn't have any work experience other than being a volunteer tutor at our school's compsci club and working part time at school as an IT assistant. Most of my projects are from classes that had a semester long deliverable and a senior year capstone project were we worked in a group with PMs and sponsors. The few personal projects that I have is a discord bot, a barebones path algorithm visualizer website, and a few web scraping applications for stocks and covid information. I didn't start applying to jobs till after I graduated (which is a mistake for sure) and I applied throughout the summer using LinkedIn and Indeed. Couple of friends gave me their referrals for companies in my area but never heard back from the company due to the lack of actual work experience, ie. internships\/co-ops. I got demotivated from the job hunt in september and was getting anxiety from not hearing back from companies and family members lecturing every other day about not finding oppurtunities. The pandemic also made me demotivated from starting new projects and doing leetcode problems without getting even a phone call from companies made me demoralized. I started only applying to jobs every now and then. Fast forward to now, in the past month I started some online courses on udemy, cs50 from harvard, and freecodecamp to learn more about web dev. Put the things I learned and started working on more personal projects, started applying to 10+ companies a day but still not hearing from anyone. I need advice on whether I should hit up a bootcamp and try to network there, in hopes of landing a job or keep doing what I am doing right now. Another option would be going back to school for my masters. My asian parents have been pushing me to work at a family member's restaurant out of state and saying I should make money instead of sitting at home on the computer. My family is a traditional Chinese family, my parents are first gen immigrants and I feel like I'm a failure and on top of the weekly talks about what I'm doing with my life, where I explain that I'm trying to learn more skills, do more projects to put on resume. My life has been getting pretty toxic and depressed and I don't know what path to take and wanted some opinion on what I should do since it feels like I'm stuck on island.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Graduated last year as a CompSci major, have no internships and co-op, started applying after graduation and throughout the summer, never heard back from any company. Started to get demotivated after spending so much time on applications and doing leetcodes daily. Started to apply in staggered amounts spread throughout the months. Started applying 10+ applications a day this past month and picked up motivation to learn a new language in Javascript and did a few online classes and crash courses on web development. Getting pressure from parents to get a job (even though I am trying and applying every day) and feel so lost on what path I should take. Need some opinions on what I should do.",

Supposedly good work\/life balance. I\u2019ll be the senior engineer on the team.  \n\n- smaller organization and environment and team. Won\u2019t get much experience with infra at scale. \n\n- Salary is $130k. Similar benefits to my current role. \n\nNot sure why but my gut feeling is leaning towards skipping this new job. Only plus is the money. This is a lateral move. I have 15 years experience in the field and don\u2019t have a problem finding other jobs. I feel like this new job won\u2019t really give me the experience I\u2019m looking for in terms of working with infrastructure architecture at scale. But I kinda want the money. I have already asked for a raise at my current job and got a double digit raise, so I\u2019m not sure if they will counter this offer. If I bring up the offer, they may not counter and I might have to just leave. \n\nUnsure why I\u2019m hesitant to leave. Partly because I\u2019m pretty comfortable and am just chasing money.

    "body":"Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m new to the market and a company recently had me take an aptitude test. It was 30 questions in which none of them had anything to do with programming but more like alphabet codex problems and abstract puzzles. I didn\u2019t do to well (11\/30) and the company said I at least need to get 20+ to be considered for the role. I find this absolutely ridiculous because I have pretty good internship and other project experience that I thought would be more important than a few puzzle questions.\n\nI\u2019m rather new to applying to full time jobs outside of interning.

    "body":"I've been working as a C++ software engineer for 11 years at a military contractor company, and while I haven't lost the drive to do software, I had a rough experience the past couple years at my place of employment and quit on the spot because of how I was being treated (they needed me a whole lot more than I needed them and management was being absurdly ridiculous). I'm also a certified flight instructor and commercial pilot, and that's the real joy of my life. So... I want to flight instruct 20-25 hours a week and find a software job that is fully remote, part-time, where I can set the hours that I do the work. That way I can just pull out a laptop in-between flying lessons and get some work done here and there.\n\nMy question is: is that asking a lot? Will job postings that say \"full-time\" consider someone for a part-time position? It seems like I'm the only person wanting such an arrangement, and I'm sure from the employer's perspective they see a part-time software engineer as being less efficient for their business perhaps? I don't know - there have been studies that say people aren't even really productive for more than like 20-30 hours a week anyways. Are there any job recruiters here who wouldn't be against considering someone who's asking for part-time work for a full-time job posting?",

I need to let off some steam because I have no idea how much of this is my fault or what I can really do to solve it, so maybe I can get your help on what to do at this point.\n\nThe problems began at the start, when the laptop they gave me made it impossible to run basic executables. The solution for that was to mail the laptop back for a replacement, which they only permitted me to do two months in. Then only when I got it back did I have to go on a business trip for another project for two more weeks, and by that point I forgot so much introductory information I was supposed to have remembered from onboarding. After that, I waited another two weeks for the helpdesk to download Node. I should also mention that I cannot download any software, I need to submit a ticket to the service desk and have them do it for me. This can take anywhere from days to weeks and they need to remote access my laptop to do the installation.\n\nThese delays compound with other issues (and my own mistakes) to bring me to today. I'm now four months into this project and still can't run a local instance.\n\nIt seems like the longer it goes on the more mistakes I make on my end. I can't concentrate on solving problems and I can't seem to remember anything. I try to keep notes but it's never enough, and our chat system wipes messages every day so I can never revisit old info. There's too many problems and I no longer expect things to get any better. It sucks to say but I really don't even care to get it working at this point; part of me wants to get fired.\n\nI'm seeking new employment, but worry that the bad habits and work ethic I developed here will carry over to the new company. Wondering if any of you have gone through the same situation and how you dealt with it. No need to call me a shitty developer, I already convinced myself.\n\nEDIT: I resolved the problems by getting a new job with 50% higher compensation. ",

    "body":"So I\u2019ve worked for a company for 4 years with no career \u201cprogression\u201d. They have offered my team a redundancy otherwise to accept a lower position on the same pay. \n\nRight now im on maternity leave and I intend to work for another year before most likely taking maternity leave again for a second baby (planned)\n\nSo I have 2 option:\n\n1. Take a 12k redundancy and look for a new job and work for a year or so in a better role. Pay will probably end up being the same or more. Redundancy pay will last me 6-7months \n\n2. Stay and take the lower position part time on 75k per year pro rata. That pay rate for the lower position is a good salary for the work. Convenient because I can go on mat leave again easy HOWEVER I don\u2019t want to go backwards in my career now \n\nIf I plan on going on leave again in a year, I feel I might as well take the money.

    "body":"Hello, all. Long time lurker, first time poster.\n\nI wanted to ask you guys if it would be wise to include that I am attending college while trying to search for a $50k+ full-time web dev job. I feel like I would look too \"junior\", but then again, I am.\n\nA little background on me: I am 22 (started college at 18, left at 20, am now back at 22), currently attending university to obtain a bachelor's in IT, and finishing my second year at the moment. However, I need a full time job (don't we all).\n\nThe reason I am majoring in IT is because I am interested in that as well, I am CompTIA A+ and Network+ certified. But I want to work in web dev first, and then if I can't secure anything I would move to trying to find entry-level IT work. At the time of writing, I am working on my dev portfolio with a couple of projects in the pipeline using React.\n\nAnyways, enough background, my questions are, would potential employers disqualify me since I am majoring in something completely different? Would it make me seem too young to employ? Would it make me seem too \"busy\" since I am in college? Or would none of this matter if I showcase a great portfolio and have the right attitude?\n\nThanks in advance for the help. BTW I am a self-taught dev.",

    "title":"Do not blindly trust Bootcamps or sites that aggregate Bootcamp reviews\/details when it comes to placement rates\/student success stories. Stories inside.",
    "body":"Hello all!\n\nI am a Data Engineer who was able to make the jump from just your ordinary schmuck to someone that gets to write code every day for a decent wage.  I have a bit of a story to tell about my experience, and it might be a little on the long-side, TL;DR will be at the bottom of the post.  I will leave some bullet-points as well so that I can offer advice on what I would do different if I had a time machine and could start from scratch.\n\nNot too long ago, I had to close down my business that I was running, and I had enough cash on-hand to enroll into a Software Development bootcamp.  I will not disclose the bootcamp or my employer, this is purely a post to help out those of you who are at the stage where you are looking at where you may want to study.\n\nWhen it came to looking for a bootcamp, I really had no idea how to tell who was good and who wasn't.  All of my local options were priced in a similar range, and they all claimed a high (90%+) placement rate, with job-placement staff on-site to help you navigate the wild world of job hunting as a Jr. Dev.\n\nI ended up going with a \"cast a wide net with what you learn\" and \"learn at your own pace\" program.  What I found out was \"cast a wide net\" meant that I only got to learn a little bit of each technology we covered.  We went through HTML\/CSS, SQL, Javascript, Python and C#\/.NET in that order, with a heavy emphasis on .NET (and a little on .NET Core).  \"Learn at your own pace\" meant that we would be enrolling on online courses from places like Pluralsight and doing some skill checks and short coursework developed by their staff... of Jr Devs that ended up working there after they couldn't find a job in the field of their choice (this is confirmed by them to me, not speculation).\n\nWhat's that, you say?  You paid over 10 grand to enroll in online courses and take some coursework developed by people who have zero industry experience?  That's correct.  At this point I want to briefly stop and note that not all camps are like this, I think I maybe just picked the worst of the bunch.  Please don't be like me, ask questions before you enroll like \"who developed your coursework?\" and \"What kind of real-world experience does your staff have?\".\n\nOk, so that kind of sucked, but at least I was going to get help finding a job when this was all over... right?  Not so much.  Our job placement guy was a total disappointment.  While he helped us write our resumes (they all looked the same... more on that later) and did mock interviews, the actual job placement part of his job left a lot to be desired.  He never actually looked for any jobs for me or my peers, instead opting to send us links to meetups around town, which if you have been to them, aren't exactly job fairs (although the networking can be beneficial).\n\nWhen I actually did get some interviews (on my own, no thanks to my job-placement guy) I quickly learned that most companies do not want to hire folks like me with zero experience in the industry.  It is important to note that I went all-in on .NET, and was trying to get a job as a full-stack developer working with OOP (lol, I didn't even learn what an API was at the time as it was never taught to me or brought up in my coursework).  In one interview that I was able to secure, the interviewer asked me about my resume, specifically where\/how it was written.  I let him know that it was written with the help of my camp's job placement guy and he flat-out told me that he had received roughly 25 applications from my peers and our resumes were exactly identical.  No idea why I got an interview and others didn't, maybe he was just curious.  I didn't get the job.\n\nIn the post title I also mentioned not to trust sites that promote \"hey go to this bootcamp!\" or \"here is a great story from Unclematttt about his experience with going from zero to hero!\".  This bit is what actually made me want to make this post.\n\nThere is a LinkedIn power-user (again, not going to disclose their name) who reached out to me and was chatting me up about his cool site that helped people just like me choose their bootcamp.  \"Hey Unclematttt, I see you went to XYZ Bootcamp- would you mind writing a review for my site and maybe doing a AMA for our users?\"  I proceeded to tell him my experience was bad, I am pretty sure the camps lie about placement numbers (at least half of my 'graduating' class never even made it into the tech industry), and the job I ultimately got was more of a support role that was at my wife's work.  I actually had to grind my way up to this position by working double-time and developing helpful scripts and applications in my free time.\n\nThe power-user's response?  Silence.  I followed up a couple of days later to ask what their thoughts were, and they never responded.  I guess it didn't really fit the narrative that they were trying to push.\n\nNow that I have shared my experience, I want to note a few things:\n\n* There *are* quality bootcamps out there, I just ended up at one of the shitty ones (do your research)\n* The job situation in my city (known as somewhat of a tech-hub in the region) might not be the same as your city\n* I could have done more to build out my portfolio before applying to jobs and possibly giving a bad first-impression (don't be like me)\n\nHere are some tips that I can share that I think might be helpful if you are just getting into the idea of picking out a school\/bootcamp and want to be successful:\n\n* I sound like a broken record here, but DO YOUR RESEARCH on your bootcamp.  Don't put blind trust into what they are *selling* you.  They churn through students and their goal is to just get your money and get you into their program\n* If you are interested in full-stack development, take baby steps and learn everything you can about backend engineering first (what is\/how to build an API, how do applications interact with databases, what are the hot SQL and NoSQL technologies in your area to learn, what are containers and how do they work, etc.).  Full-stack devs do not just sprout out of the ground IME, it can take years to become proficient with any given stack\n* What stacks are hot right now?  Are there lots of jobs for ELK?  What about MEAN?  Find something that you like and go nuts on it\n* Personalize your resume.  Start with what your camp\/school helps you build, then do something (anything!) to make it different than your peers\n* IME there was more success with Javascript devs from my camp than anyone else.  Consider learning Javascript in detail and some of the more popular frameworks like ~~AngularJS~~ and Vue (I have been informed that Angular isn't hot anymore- I am not a JS dev, so my apologies on that, research what frameworks are popular in your area.  Edit: this is debated below in the comments, so again do research on what Frameworks are popular in your area.)\n* You will likely end up using databases in some way shape or form during your career, make sure you understand the ins-and-outs of various database technologies and how it applies to your stack\/languages of choice\n* Develop a solid portfolio.  If you are doing front-end work, this is a lot easier as people like \"pretty pictures\" (my opinion).  Make daily commits on Github (many employers will ask for your Github profile to check it out before deciding to interview you).  Also have a basic-to-awesome portfolio website, and even though we all hate it, get a LinkedIn account.  Consider buying the premium version if you have the cash for it.\n* Try to find a language\/stack that you are comfortable with and enjoy and go HARD on it.  Make sure before you make this decision that there are plenty of jobs that want those skills, there is fierce competition for Jr Dev roles, so you will need to apply to many of them (maybe even hundreds) before you land your first gig.\n* Make sure you are in a good place mentally before starting on this journey.  It can be soul-crushing at times, but there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel if you persevere\n\nI could write a whole lot more, but I think that this covers most of it.  Sorry for the long post, this is kind of therapeutic to write out.  Believe in yourself, but also take care of your future self by not making some of the mistakes I did along the way.  If I could do it, anyone can with the right amount of drive.\n\nTL;DR Make sure your bootcamp doesn't suck before enrolling.  Know the local market and what skills are sought-after.  Don't trust sites that paint a pretty picture, this whole process is a total grind.  Believe in yourself and put in the work.\n\nedit: Minor grammar fix.  Also, if you want to reach out to me with questions, please feel free to shoot me a DM or ask below.  Always happy to help where I can.",

What is the work life balance in general comparing to software developer positions. More working hours? On call? \n\nAlso how common work from home, I heard it is rare because the company wouldn't want me to access my tech, data from home?\n\n3. If I work in this position for a few years can I get into Software development or Data science if I don't like it. Would those two years be considered as two years experience in Data science, Software development? Since I am close to 30 this is really important for me.\n\n4. Can I use the systems I developed in the team for my personal trades, investments?\n\n5. Is there any short online course, tutorial I can try to be able to understand what this job will be like? And also to gain some knowledge before interview.\n\n6. When I asked this in r\/quant my post get removed and the mod messaged me a long post talking about how he quit his quant job and says I will quit too because this area is not beneficial to society and it will die after the big crash of today's financial system.

In my experience companies act as if they own you.\n\nI've been offered a new job with a globally renowned company in the UK and have been presented with a contract that intends to own all my IP\/code. I've been on sabbatical and developed a lot of projects that are in full production.\n\nNaturally asked for a waiver for said pre-existing projects. The company is not interested in engaging in this process at all. Stated that if they were relevant to my role\/the employer, then the IP would reside with them.\n\nWhy do companies act like they own programmers? Why should all my ideas belong to the employer? Why shouldn't I be allowed to continue with my pre-existing projects on my own dime\/time?! Sure, anything I do concerning their business is 100% theirs. But to not even want to engage in discussion of side projects is just ridiculous. Especially given that the hiring manager loved the fact I had side projects during interviews?!\n\nHonestly, as a creative individual, I am thinking about leaving software and becoming a plumber. Pay outside London is poor, and what's the point in developing all these skills if I can't use them to benefit my life? I feel so trapped in this career. Am I the only one that feels this way? How do the rest of you deal with these issues? Do you refuse to sign? Or ignore such contracts and go ahead anyway?\n\nUPDATE: UK contracts often state that the company owns everything developed \"in the course of your employment\" (which is exactly the problem with the current contract that I've been presented with). This clause sounds very innocent. But it's not. See \\[1\\]. Note that using your own equipment in your own time does not save you! \n\nFrom \\[1\\]:\n\n>If material which includes IP rights is created outside office hours and\/or using the employee\u2019s private resources this may give rise to arguments that the rights belong to the employee rather than their employer, but that is not decisive. The fact that work is done outside normal working hours does not necessarily mean that the work is not done in the course of employment as, for many employees, there is often no clear demarcation of the hours of work.  \n>  \n>The key question to be asked is whether the work was the kind of work which the employee was employed to do i.e. whether it was within the scope of their employment. Could the employee have been ordered to do the work and would it have been a breach of contract for the employee to not do it? The terms of any contract of employment and job description will be relevant, however, these (and duties more generally) often evolve in the course of time and it may therefore not be appropriate to rely on them exclusively.\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] Russell-Cooke associate Emily MacDonald looks at intellectual property rights within the context of the employment contract (2020).

For example, the founder of the company takes every Monday off to spend time with his family. But we bust ass when things need to get done.\n\nI have lots of passions outside of work that I want to pursue while I'm young and strong! This company really likes the work I do and I enjoy working there.\n\nMy 6-month review is coming up soon and that's when I'd contemplate asking for a raise. At my stage in life and in my career, though, my time is more valuable to me. I am very much able to live my best life and save money on my current salary. I'd like to work one less full day a week. I sincerely believe as well, that this would barely impact my productivity.\n\nWhat are people's thoughts on asking for one weekday off as opposed to an increase in pay?

However, this is just where I wanted to see if these are big enough red flags to be wary of. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. emailed me on my work email, had to ask at second email to contact me elsewhere\n2. the recruitment company has a legit website and linked in and the website graphically is very clean. It only has a contact portion of it though with the CEO's phone number. It seems to be new and I don't know if this is something that happens with any sort of scam. i.e., sometimes in certain areas people make 'companies' over and over on platforms until their scam is caught but again just repeat that process and present themselves as a 'new' company. \n3. The insistence on that this is for a company that is looking to have the turnaround process of the interview in a very short time. It seems it is like the process feels perfect in regards to minimal interview(s).\n4. pay is extremely good. Base is 2x what I make + bonus + shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings which are literally holding me to not think I am being crazy are:\n\n1. recruiter is legit on linked in it seems.\n2. job is for a company within nasdaq (can't find the posting elsewhere online but that is a given.\n3. didn't seem like a mass generated email, it was very identifiable that they were talking to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I being crazy? The work email thing just put this whole thing into a very bad place for me as I have zero idea how they got it.

They suddenly go from being a Masters + PhD in biology to a software engineer at FAANG within a year and in a way it frustrates me to know that these wealthy candidates only got into these top companies because they can afford to buy the resources, all the coursera courses they want, pay for a bootcamp, or CS MS, it's truthfully unfair.\n\nI know I shouldn't judge but I truly am passionate about CS and to see wealthy candidates with no passion for CS (otherwise why wouldn't it be their undergrad?) switching to Software Engineering at FAANG companies immediately within a year through different means (e.g. references, family, wealth, buying resources, etc) and get in without having to even study CS is simply unfair.\n\nHow do you guys feel about this?

    "body":"Hello everyone! I'm working on getting back into the workforce after a three-year gap. I figure I should lay out all the gory details so I can get the best advice possible.\n\nThree years ago, I was laid off from my last job, where I worked for a little over two years as a data engineer. Prior to that, I worked as a technical consultant for two years at one of the big software giants (name omitted for privacy reasons). Subsequent to my layoff, my then-husband and I moved to my current city so I could begin a master's degree program. We had a nasty divorce as I embarked on my studies, which were going reasonably well until everything went remote. Coupled with my depression (which is being treated), the stress of the divorce and online classes forced me into a leave of absence from my graduate program, to which I may decide not to return in favor of finding a full-time job.\n\nThis is where I need some help. It's been a long time since I appeared for a technical interview, though I do have experience conducting such interviews from my last job. I have several books I am using as preparation materials (Algorithms Illuminated by Roughgarden, Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, et al, CTCI, and EPI) and I am also trying my hand at some of the practice interview problems on CodeSignal. I have always struggled with these types of questions despite my four-year degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, and I am finding the preparation process rather overwhelming. Furthermore, I am worried about the large gap in my resume. I suppose my explanation is reasonable, but how can I convince prospective employers to take a chance on me?\n\nI feel very alone in this process, and it feels like the odds are stacked against me. Would I be better off just returning to my graduate program (my leave lasts until January)? How can I overcome this gap in my work history? I would also appreciate suggestions on effective strategies and helpful resources for brushing up on my skills and becoming more confident with technical questions.\n\nDMs are welcome.",

I know it might seem that it is a little bit late, but I suddenly realized that I don\u2019t want to study business and marketing anymore. Besides, it will be hard to find a job in this field. However, there are a lot of job opportunities for those who have a degree in computer sciences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI realized that the employment market is quite competitive at the moment, and it\u2019s hard to find a job with my degree. There is tough competition even for a place in an unpaid internship. I have no idea why did I choose this pathway. My parents don\u2019t have their own business, compared to some of my classmates. I think back in time, I applied for something that might be easier for me. Now, I feel like I\u2019ve wasted my time and money. Perhaps, I shouldn\u2019t have studied economics, and maybe I wouldn\u2019t have even noticed my epic mistake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see that my mates from my dorm, that study IT, already found some part-time jobs in their field, and they are just in their 2nd year of study. They\u2019ve learned everything at college, and now they can make some good money on what they\u2019ve learned. While I\u2019m struggling to find an unpaid internship with my degree, I will graduate with honors if I do good on my finals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I look for some jobs online, I see that almost every company requires an IT specialist and pays good money. While there are no offers for business and marketing graduates. I\u2019ve reached that point when everyone needs some work experience, but no one wants to hire me so I can get one. This situation became so ridiculous, so I even found a meme based on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the meantime, one of my friends sent me this link \u2014 [https:\/\/www.cardinaldigitalmarketing.com\/services\/seo\/](https:\/\/www.cardinaldigitalmarketing.com\/services\/seo\/) and told me that I can find myself doing SEO.

The only offer for a job I've got is as a data centre technician in Europe for one of the big five with a salary in the range \u00a335-40k. \n\nThe fact that I'm offered this job in the first place was a bit of a surprise as I've only really considered going into software engineering. My goal is to build a career in software engineering, but having lived a broke student life for the past 4 years, I'm very tempted by the idea of having a salary as soon as possible. My alternative is living off savings for the next 3-4 months after graduating and applying for software jobs while practicing interviews and personal projects. Another significant con of the technician role will require me to relocate to a place I don't really want to live. \n\nThanks for your help!",

    "body":"Good day all.. I'm here for perspective and curious how others are handling the shift to full remote offers.\n\nOffer:\n\nRemote with the occasional trip to HQ (once a month) -- I'm within driving distance so this is not expected to drag me through flights, etc.\n\nStartup\n\nBase pay > current\n\nCurrently no 401k match or bonus -- \"it's coming\" FWIW\n\n100% health coverage\n\nEquity\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExisting:\n\nSmall Design services team in large org COVID remote but very old school and continued pressure to return to office. By design services I mean other companies come to us to get it done.\n\nParent Org has recovered from COVID slowdown. Our division is beginning but I've spent \\~15 months stringing 10 hour weeks together if that.\n\nBase + Bonus + ESPP + 401k match\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRisk -\n\nObviously there is inherent risk in a startup. I feel there is a risk of layoff in my currently role, I'm surprised I'm still employed TBH, but I'm 1 of 1 for my discipline, so I think it's more about trying to attract work. It's hard to say, \"We can handle all your FW\/HW needs\" when you don't have anyone to do it.\n\nVariable pay -\n\nCurrently I have a 20% Bonus target, of which I've never seen more than 2.6%, although I only worked through one Bonus cycle (COVID). I also have ESPP which has a minimum payout and due to COVID had banner returns, all in this could potentially makeup \\~$40k but expected to settle around \\~$15-20k as the world returns to normal.\n\nStartup has equity, if things go well this could return, but it is a hardware\/services company. Historically, aside from Roku, we're not hearing that many Cinderella stories. Maybe see a 2x on the strike.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day, I want to work on cool stuff. With young kids, being remote during the pandemic has been a nightmare and a blessing. Being able to reduce daycare bills is a plus, being able to tend to other things at home and not need to fill all my free time away from work with mundane tasks is huge. I don't miss the people in the office, I'm the guy that typically wears noise cancelling all day to work. I compartmentalize well and treat work as work.\n\nI'm curious to hear how others are weighing their options as offices begin to push for return while remote work is simultaneously being flaunted in portions of tech.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nStartup with slightly higher base and full remote vs Public company with historical higher TC and office  demand. How much is full remote really worth?\n\nThoughts?",

I've been here for 1 year, and I'm actually finding my work very engaging, but there are just some issues I've noticed in this job for the past few months that make me feel like I can't work here anymore.\n\nThis discussion is not intended to be offensive, but I don't really know of a \"good\" way to describe my predicament.\n\nAlthough our site is based in the US, 80% of our employees are on visa from a certain southeast Asian country. Some of my American coworkers who were on track for promotion and exceeding expectations under American-born managment were suddenly let go when management randomly got rearranged recently to be a supermajority of people from said country. They were all terminated  within two weeks of the permutation for \"exceptionally poor performance\", and never were they asked to improve\/put on PIP.

I'm not currently on PIP, but I think I only have about 3-4 months left here. I need some time to decompress, not worry about meeting my metrics, and start applying for new jobs, but I don't know how to do that. If I take PTO for a few days to do so, my metrics will fall. We're told that'll be taken into account in our 1-on-1 meetings if our performance suffers, but I feel like it'll just be turned around on me, saying I should be performing well enough that taking PTO shouldn't cause me to fail to meet my monthly goals.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n* Is my only option to just try the PTO route and hope management doesn't try singling me out for it?\n* With about one YOE, am I likely to be able to get out of here in 3-4 months, or do I need to take something else temporarily in the meantime, and try again later?

    "body":"Pretty straightforward question, but I was wondering if anyone could provide an honest review on what it's like to work as a SWE at Tinder. \n\nI've heard really mixed reviews about Tinder being a \"boys club\", very political, disorganized in terms of work distribution, unethical (profiting off of people's loneliness), a bad place for career growth, and incredibly poor management. On the other hand, people say it's a great place to work, is super chill, and pays really well. I'm still skeptical though since it has a rating of 3.3 on Blind and all the good reviews I found online are from 2016... \n\nSo yeah! If you could redo it over would you still work at Tinder? What's great about it, bad about it, etc etc. \n\nThank you ahead of time to anyone who does reply to this question.\n\n\\*\\* Bonus points if you're an iOS Engineer at Tinder!!  \\*\\*",

    "body":"Hi All,\n\nFirst post here, apologies if anything isn't in order.\n\nI wanted to get some input\/opinions on my situation from all the good folks here, as I've been trying to make this switch for a while now. Here's my situation:\n\n\n- background\/backstory (feel free to skip)\nI'm in my early thirties, have worked almost a decade in tech consulting (implementing\/configuring SQL-based tools for things like sales management and accounting). In that time I worked mostly as an individual contributor, with a few years as lead consultant for some bigger projects (switched back to single contributor after a mini-burn out and deciding that being in meetings\/writing email all day wasn't for me).\n\nI studied computer science in college back in Europe (about a decade ago) and am currently living and working in Toronto, Canada in consulting for a large organization (I actually quite like the company, I started here about 2 years ago, they have decent benefits\/pay, though lately things have been changing slightly for the worse I find).\n\n- challenge\/goal:\nI would want to switch to software development, my degree focused on this moreso, but due to circumstances and emigrating I kind of ended up in consulting. I'm finding it particularly challenging to find time\/motivation to do side projects and coding after a full day at work (and I probably have some covid fatigue I think, measures downtown toronto have long been quite strict). In terms of prior coding experience: I got a Java certification a few years back and I have played around with  variety of language (Python, Java, C#, Cobol, Javascript etc.), but I find I'm lacking in recent and real world experience (as well as some of the supporting tools and technologies, things like Kubernetes or getting fully up to speed with AWS\/Azure and microservice architecture).\n\nI've spent the last few years thinking about making the switch, but have always come up lacking on the execution and I REALLY want to change that. However, I also know that doing this as a side project after work every day is quite likely to fail. For this reason I was thinking of enrolling in one of the coding bootcamps available here, they're quite pricey but I think it might be the fastest\/surest way for me to get into a dev role sooner rather than later, which will ultimately help with me develop the required skills further (I like\/enjoy studying and learning as part of a job and think I'm quite good at it). My question is what would you do in my situation? Any specific suggestions\/ideas or any glaring oversights\/flaws that you see with my approach? Also: any experience (attending or hiring from) any of the specific coding bootcamps in Toronto is also most welcome!\n\nThanks all,\n\nR",

I've been programming since I was 18 but I finally decided to become a software developer at 24. I've gone through Unity (C#) and Flash (ActionScript 3) for videogames, and also C, Java, Smalltalk for the basics at uni, then Matlab and other misc languages for misc subjects.\n\nI got my first dev job as a Salesforce Dev at the start of 2020. I'm not a complete beginner, but I still feel that I'm behind regarding experience. My other friends are working on other languages and technologies (JS, React, Python, Node, you name it), and when I listen to what talk about it makes me feel that Apex is just a bubble that won't teach me much about the software development world. I want to learn more are get bigger challenges. But Salesforce is not providing that for me right now, and I don't know if that is because my current company sucks or because Salesforce is lacking things to teach me.\n\nMy goal these first years is to acquire as much experience and focus on expanding my knowledge. I don't care about the money or the job position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now I'm being offered two new positions: \n\n1) SSr. Salesforce Dev for a really good medium-sized company that is one of the best in the country. The talk with the dev leader was great and he sure knew a lot about Salesforce. He put emphasis on that they follow good practices and develop high quality code. I'll be working side by side with this person and I feel that I can learn a lot from him.\n\n2) Jr. Dev at an international company (offering Java, Python, and JS-related jobs mainly) that is growing a lot these last years and offers an HR product to the biggest companies in the world. The coding tasks they gave me to complete were the toughest I've ever been given for a job application. The interview with the leader was also great. He reviewed my code and did excellent corrections. It also made me remember that I've been out of touch with the most common practices in OOP. I have very good references for this company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now I don't know what to do. I do want to move to other techs, but that can be done whenever I want and I don't want to lose a good opportunity.\n\nShould I push a little bit further with Salesforce? Does Salesforce have much more to teach me?\n\nOr should I make the change now that I have the chance?",

    "body":" \n\nI've been a .Net developer for many years and love the technology, but really dont like the majority of jobs I see for .Net. It seems like the market is quite saturated . Also , I'd say a majority of the .Net jobs these days are 50\/50 .Net\/Angular\/React and Azure based DevOps .. There are a lot of demands for low pay and many employers tell me how saturated they are with qualified applicants for these low pay\/high demand jobs. I know .Net is considered romantically appealing and so many want to learn it. It is what drove me to learn it in 2002. Although I was a VB6\/ MFC programmer prior to it so got into .Net before it became as well known as today. However, I am starting to think this may not a good trait about .Net.. It has this romantic appeal and corporations that use it have unrealistic views about the framework and expectations of those who use it.\n\nDespite Java, for example, being an even larger framework, I have found many jobs in Java are much more focused on specific development needs and realistic demands. Rarely do I see a Java Spring job description that wants you also to be senior DevOps dev, like I do with many .Net jobs. Good luck ever finding a purely back-end .Net developer job, they are basically non-existent.\n\nI am interested in a framework\/language that would be more lightweight, allow for more back-end focused development where I could become more specialized in one area of development.\u00a0 E.g. I hear a lot of DevOps people will do back-end dev with Golang and\/or Python which is focused on helping to build and manage microservices.\u00a0 Having to spend a lot of time with React on top of that is pretty rough, but that is what I am seeing in many .Net jobs.  I feel if i am stuck working a full-stack type of job, I might as well just migrate towards Node and have a full-stack JS framework, rather than having to deal with complexities of two large frameworks.. Also, the demand for Azure DevOps is tough , since my background is mostly AWS and I would prefer a role that is more focus on one discipline (web dev vs DevOps) than having to be full-stack web dev\/DevOps dev.",

    "title":"Struggling with giving myself a \"title\"",
    "body":"Hey, so I've been self-studying web development, and programming in general for a year and a half now. I haven't applied for jobs yet, because I'm currently doing my one year of mandatory army service, which is not the point, but I wanted to get that clear. However, I've had 2 employers contact me on LinkedIn to go for an interview, one as a Node.js developer and the other was as a Back-end developer. And this was probably a very needed confidence booster, although I've had to turn them down because of my army service.\n\nMy problem is, I have not focused on one tool. Throughout my studying process, I've only focused on getting the fundamentals right along with learning how to build things, no matter what the platform is, nor the tools used to build them.\n\nI've avoided using Angular, React.js, or any other specific framework or library, and stuck with working on all my web projects using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I even avoided using Bootstrap. I have also studied fundamental CS and programming subjects (such as the fundamentals in topics like OS's, Networking, Game Development, Hardware Design, etc.), learned the basics of other languages (C, C#, and Python), and built small things using them, for example, I worked on Linux for more than a year, tackled building a small game in C and did it, worked on small desktop apps using C# and .NET to be familiar with an actual OOP language and a different platform, got introduced to XML, and it gave me a solid ground to work with SVG in a web app I have been working on lately, I also worked on a small Flask project with a friend and helped them debug it and get it live. Note that I've tried to tinker around with all of this just because I want to be a programmer before being a Web developer, which is very important to me.\n\nBack to the Web, I've only been building personal projects, using Node.js for their back ends, along with vanilla JS on the front end. Although I see myself more fit to be a back-end developer, I don't think I know enough to title myself as a specialized \"back-end developer\" yet. I also haven't worked with any specific framework or tool on the front end and I'm not a designer, so I am not sure of that as well. However, I can implement complete designs using HTML and CSS. I have practiced this trying to remake templates I find on the internet by myself and finishing most of them, but I can't actually come up with design ideas myself.\n\nI know I'm ready and capable to get a job once I'm done with this year of service, but the problem is, I don't know what I can call myself or where I specialize in the Web. I'm sure I can build things, I can tackle any problems in a web app, learn the specific tools needed to solve them. I've been through these steps several times and I've completed the apps, but I don't know if this is enough for employers. I see a lot of jobs with specific titles such as \"React developer, Angular developer, etc.\" and I don't know. I'm currently building my portfolio, and I don't know what the title should be. Should I go with a \"Web developer\" or is it \"too general\"? Should I go with \"JavaScript developer\"? Or would it be thought of as me just open to using JavaScript? Thanks for reading through and I would really appreciate any advice!",

    "body":"I\u2019m a developer with 3 years experience and have been working at my current job during the pandemic. I was being trained and thought things were going well but recently my boss told me I need to step up and take more ownership of my work. Usually when a task comes through, I need help understanding what is even needed to be done as there are no tech specs on the ticket, just a quick description. After having a talk with my \u201cmentor\u201d (a Sr dev) about the task I am then able to start working on it, and along the way will need help here and there when I get stuck on an issue. Overall, I thought I was progressing and felt good about where I was at. My boss had another talk with me saying that the project they assigned me to is a little \u201cover my head\u201d and to keep my busy is having me work on QA work. It\u2019s sort of unclear what this means for my job or what to expect but I\u2019m not sure what to do. Currently, I have zero stress about work because the QA work I do is manual testing and I am able to clock out and forget about work. Whereas before I would never feel like I\u2019m producing enough code and losing sleep over solutions and getting anxious thinking about having to reach out to ask for help when I\u2019m stuck. The company I work for really likes me and doesn\u2019t want me to leave but I\u2019m also torn on what to do about my career. Should I accept this mental break and get paid well to do a job that requires not much thought, but lose momentum in developing? Or do I fight for a development job or find a different company to work with and continue forth as a dev? It\u2019s hard to say what I want to do because I am so comfortable at having an easy job and enjoying this mental break so my motivation is low at this point.",

    "body":"3 months or so ago I joined a mid sized tech company in a developer role. To be honest, my first few months here haven't been that great at all, but I'm burnt out on the job hunting thing and I want to get at least a year under my belt before I leave so it looks OK on the resume. For added context, the company has had a massive amount of voluntary turnover and the company basically has no culture at all. It's very much a \"show up, work, don't socialize, leave\" sterile environment and I believe that has caused a lot of folks to find work elsewhere.\n\nSo I got an email from HR where I have to fill out a survey for my job satisfaction. They ask questions about if I like the company culture, how satisfied I am with my job, did the job meet the expectations etc. Then I'm told HR will go over these results with me in a 1 on 1. For even more context, this is the same company that had HR reach out to me directly and asked me to write a good Glassdoor review for them, these people have no shame (I did not leave any review for the record).\n\nSo my question is, how do I answer that? If I answer honestly (the company is pretty shit) I'll likely have a target on my back and I'll have to start job hunting again. If I say everything is amazing nothing will change and it will continue being shit until I decide to leave. Sigh. \n\nAny thoughts?",

She was dealing with some health issues earlier on, so she didn't graduate until her late 20s. By the time she graduated, her GPA was barely eligible for graduation, had no internships or work experience, and she had almost nothing to show on her resume. I worked with her to get some small projects on there to fill it out, but they're nothing impressive. I've been trying to encourage her to work on more in depth projects so she could have more stuff to put on her resume and actually gain some coding\/ debugging experience as well, but that doesn't really seem to be an option for her. She seems to expect a company to hire her based on the fact that she has a degree and willingness to learn.\n\nIt's been almost been a year and a half since graduation, and she still has no leads. It feels like she has forgotten a lot of fundamentals from not practicing. I think her stuborness to practice programming and work on projects shows that she has little passion in programming, which is totally ok, but she gets really mad whenever I bring that up, understandably so. \n\nObviously my friend has to make some adjustments to her attitude and expectations, but what do you guys recommend for someone who has a CS degree and little passion for programming. She's entertained the idea of becoming a project manager, but I still feel like you need some technical experience to manage and lead a program.",

    "body":"Hi,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a HS student and EU national that will be attending an EU university next year to study CSE. I've been checking out career paths and such\n\nand I've seen that the easiest way to end up working in the US is to find a company in the EU that has offices in the US and ask for relocation.\n\nThe thing is, I can't seem to find much information regarding the actual process, namely:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. How hard\/competitive it is to get relocated,\n\n2. What type of companies are the best to ask for relocation(I'm assuming FAANG, but I'm wondering if it's equally doable with others)\n\n3. What types of profiles get relocated(i.e years of experience, ability)\n\n4. Does having an MS degree in an American uni help convince companies to start the process,\n\n5. How long does it take to get relocated.\n\n6. How common is it for people to ask for relocations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long set of questions, but these are the things I had trouble finding about. Thanks!",

    "body":"I'm kind of in a weird situation right now and am looking for some input.\n\nI'm a senior CS student and was lucky enough to land my first paid software engineering internship this summer (I've done 2 others but one was unpaid and one was cyber security). The company I'm working at is a large and has offices all over the U.S. but is headquartered local to me. The pay is relatively low ($15\/hr) and the company is a not a tech company. I'm not quite sure what fulltime employees make but I believe it's in the range from $50-65k starting.\n\nMy issue is that my boss has repeatedly told me that he is hoping to extend my internship and potentially hire me full time after I graduate next fall (technically I'm graduating a semester early) if things go well. While I'm super excited and appreciate this, I can't help but wonder if I should be exploring other options.\n\nI'm worried that starting at a local non-tech company might hurt me down the road when I want to move on. I also know that FANNG-like companies are more open to new-grads than other demographics. I'm concerned that it might be a mistake to just take the first job offered to me (if it is even offered).\n\nThe thing is that I have a decent GPA (3.6) but go to a virtually unknown liberal arts college in upstate NY. It might be hard to get my foot in the door coming from a non-target school and one with such low name recognition. However, I have some solid internships and projects on my resume and have made connections with multiple people working at big N tech companies. Also this internship will help me get even more practical experience.\n\nI know it's early to ask this question but it has been on my mind a lot recently and I'm wondering how valid my concerns are. Would I be stupid not to take this job if it is offered? Would I be selling myself short if I did take it? I'm not really sure what to do here.",

    "body":"I've been working for this company for 2 years now. I was originally employed  to work remotely as they were a startup with a grand total of 1 other developer.\n\nAs the team grew, they got an office in a shared space (hated it, 1 hour commute there, 1 hour back) and I went there every day for about 3 months(?). Then Covid happened and back to remote I go.\n\nThey announced the return to office, a different office this time though. This one is closer (40 minutes by foot\/bus). We are up to 8 employees now (not including the CEO\/CFO), two of them work in **England**. Literally hundreds of miles away.\n\nI honestly can't fathom why they are saying I need to be in the office. I told him straight up (I have always been up front and honest, if not a bit blunt) that I can not afford the \u00a3120 in doggy day care per month.\n\nThe response was \"That's not my problem, these are the things you have to think about before getting pets\". I did think of them, I've been working and delivering projects on time remotely for 2\/3rds of my employment here, why the fuck do I need to be in an office?!\n\nThis is a company that I've been putting in 100% into for the past 2 years, working extra hours, going the extra mile. My dog won't be a puppy forever (how the hell can people even afford to have kids?!), but with the tone I doubt a compromise will even be considered.\n\nI've even been rejected a pay rise this year, I am currently sitting on \u00a330k per year, about \u00a34k less than competing jobs and my peers of similar experience.\n\nOur office is in an industrial block. In the winter it's cold as shit, in the summer it's hot as shit, the bathrooms are awful, there is no where to really eat because the breakroom is tiny  and there is a fucking gym next door that blares awful 100bpm dance music all day and slams weights. It also costs me \u00a35 to get here. So in total, this move back to the office is going to cost me \u00a3140 more per month.\n\nI am fucking pissed and now have to go through the hassle of dealing with this confrontation next week and I honestly can't be arsed.\n\nI've always read here that \"*don't be loyal and give them everything, because they will take it al*l\" but felt it was different here, but it's not. It's the same.\n\nI'll never work outside of my hours again and I won't touch a single thing outside of my department.\n\nNot my problem\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes it's a rant, I need to get it out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I know this got an overall negative response, but I thought an update would be in order anyway.\n\nFirst off, thanks to the person(s) who recommended I read over my contract. It actually states that I am indeed fully remote with the possibility of going into the office *one per month* for a company meeting.\n\nI would also like to point out, like another Redditor here has. I am in the UK, we have rights and contracts when it comes to work. They can't just *change their mind* whenever they like. So I have a right to be upset, I put in the time and thought into getting a breed of dog that fits around my working hours and got him as a puppy **because** working remote was what was agreed at my time of employment.\n\nAlso to all the people that say \"dog doesn't need daycare\" or \"just leave them at home and get someone to pop in to take them for a walk\". Yeah guys, it's a puppy. They can't just be left alone for 7 hours a day with zero stimulation. There is a perfectly good reason why shelters have a ton of dogs aged between 1 and 2 years old.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body":"Hey,\n\nI have been working at this small software company for about 2.5 years now as a full stack developer (first job after graduating with a CS degree). The company only has four employees and only two of us are developers (the current director of technology and me). It is still a young company so we are still very actively developing the product, which is a web application used by large businesses in their day to day operations.\n\nYesterday we had a meeting and it was announced that our director of technology is stepping away from his full time position to a more part time\/consulting role where he'll only be putting in 10-20 hours a week. Later I was told by our main boss that he and the director of technology talked about how to go about this and the director of technology was adamant that I was capable of filling the role. He mentioned that he needs a few days to put together the numbers but then we'll talk about an increase in compensation since I'll be taking on more responsibilities. I'm not sure if my title would change or not.\n\nI am confident that I can do the job, but I am a little concerned that the compensation increase may not adequately reflect the responsibilities that I'm being given. I am currently being paid below market for the area especially considering I already had a ton of responsibilities, so I'm worried that the new compensation will only really get me up to where I probably should have been in the first place. I have also been in the process of interviewing with a different company in the last few weeks to try to get a better gauge on my market value but I'm still in that process so I haven't received an official offer from them yet to compare against, but from the looks of it I would be paid considerably more at that company.\n\nHow do I go about negotiating this if the salary my boss pitches to me is below my expectations? I only have 2.5 years of experience but at the same time they're asking me to fill a role of someone with 20+ years of experience. What is reasonable for me to ask for? Should it be more than a mid level developers salary?\n\nSome more info about the business:\n\nEven though its a young company that could still be considered a startup, I know that we're very stable financially and the last few months have been especially good to us. To my knowledge there are no immediate plans of hiring another person. So in theory with the director of technology taking a step back there should be plenty of funds to add to my compensation... Also for what its worth I really enjoy working here. Everyone is great and the culture is very relaxed.",

    "body":"Hi everyone! Looking to make a career pivot into web development. Unhappy in my current career path - overworked in a toxic environment. Only 2 years out of school but web development and coding seems like a cool\/rewarding career. Currently trying to find a role that affords a better work\/life balance so I can teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my spare time. \n\nI understand that this will take 8-12 months with a full time job before I can reasonably make a pivot into web development. I\u2019ve started learning through FreeCodeCamp. \n\nI have a few questions:\n\nWill I be prepared for an entry level job in the industry after completing the courses through this program? \n\nDo I need a portfolio of side projects I\u2019ve done over these 12 months? \n\nWhat is a reasonable starting salary for entry level web development in NYC? (I know I\u2019ll probably be taking a decent pay cut here)\n\nHow long is a typical tenure at an entry level position before moving on if internal advancement isn\u2019t attainable?\n\nMy goal is to gain experience in an entry level \/ junior role and eventually become a full stack dev (starting with Python after html, css, and JavaScript). New to the industry and looking to learn. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

I think I'm pretty good at looking at things from a systemic level and considering technical factors which might affect them. A lot of work I've done is system integration rather than hyper-specific low-level dev (although that I've done too).\n\nHowever, I'm still struggling to see how to transition my career from being a developer to contributing to decisions on *what* gets developed given a problem. I've joined a very young startup a couple years ago specifically to address this, as I was promised an influence on the direction of the company. Of course this proved to be not the case. Yes, as the person leading development of our embedded product I have a good degree of control of how things are implemented, but I have no input into the conversations around \"how we as a company can help our customers given our product\". Any promise of that in the future always get trumped \"temporary\" business needs of me needing to churn out more product as code monkey doing what it's told. All that makes me feel like I should be more actively deciding on a career realignment instead of hoping it would happen organically.

    "title":"Career after cancer",
    "body":"Long story short, I am early thirty guy living in the Netherlands. Originally studied physics at Uni, even went on and did a phd because I was passionate about the topic. Left academia and has been working as a developer in the whole \"Data\"-business for the past 6 years. I don't like buzz words but titles have come and gone so much, but just to give an idea of I am doing I have been called things such as data engineer,data scientist, big data develeper and even machine learning engineer etc.... The past 4 years I have been working as an independent contractor (zzp), as I enjoy my freedom.\n\nUnless a fellow colleague in the Netherlands corrects me, the tech industry scene is not great there. So I have mostly worked in Brick and Mortar companies (telco, finance, retail, logitistics, fashion etc..). While covid19 obviously meant externals getting laid off, and I was no exception there, it became also a blessing for my career as a lot of companies are seeking contractors in other countries. This is were I got a taste of working at a tech company, tbh still surprised they were hiring contractors. There is a clear noticeable difference in mentality between tech and brick&mortar people. It was an amazing experience to have such talented and motivated colleagues. More on that later.\n\nSadly, things are never easy, I was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer a couple of months ago. Unsurprisingly, I had to let go of my current contracts to prioritize my treatment. \n\nI am about three quarter into the treatment process now. It has been not easy of course. You think you will be the exception, and that you will overcome the side effects, but they hit you like a truck.\n\nSomehow by miracle, I was able to negociate a contract with another tech to start towards the end of my treatment. In the period of my treatment, I was approached as well by two FANG companies for remote permanent. Out of curiosity, I followed the process with one of them and was even invited for online onsite interviews. As the side effects were intensifying, and I stopped the process.\n\nWork has always played a very central role to me. I am very passionate. Being able to improve and push myself to master my craft is very important to me. Cancer, however, is making me question a bit where I want to go with my career.\n\nAs I mentionned at the beginning, I worked mostly at Brick and Mortar. While I respect the people I have worked with, I do think B&M are the worst and most depressing places to work at as a developer. I often like to compare IT departments with Coat Hangers. Nice to have in the house, looks fancy and it's fun to display your coats (developers), but of course you rarely wear most of them (i.e. you can easily get away doing nothing for months and nobody will notice nor care). Everybody is different and , yes, some do enjoy the peaceful life of low pressure calm work. In my case, I have always needed action. I spend quite a lot of time initiating a lot of projects while working at these companies. It always felt I was a mule dragging a cart while 3-4 other people would pull in other directions. As you may guess already, I definitely was not the greatest friend with my managers. I do, however, take pride that I worked on some of the most innovative projects. I count myself lucky, despite the fights, that my managers's managers always saw me in high regard and always provided me with great recommendations which allowed me to keep moving forward.\n\nSince the cancer, however, and not being in my twenties anymore, I fear I will not have the energy anymore to fight similar battles. The though of working as contractor again at brick & mortar makes me almost as nauseous as my chemotherapy. I don't think I will always be able to work as an independent contractor with tech companies. Possibly, renouncing my freedom and  taking the opportunity to work as an employee at FANG (Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google) could be interesting, but looking at glassdoor it looks like I would be making less than I am making now (at least if I have a decent year with 10-11 month billeability).  My problem as well is that I am not really interested in working as a manager. I love working as an individual contributor. Bossing people around does not interest me. I want to refine my craft, keep innovating and building exciting stuff. This is one of the main reason I am   less interested in working as a employee. Being an employee feels like you are stuck in some cage where the only way to grow is climbing the ladder. I hate all the politics and petty backstabbing for silly meaningless titles. I take pride in what I create, not whatever non-sensical imaginary title or how many people are sucking up to me.\n\nHow would people want to move forward? Are there maybe some interesting companies and projects in the Netherlands I am not considering?",

    "body":"Hi guys,\n\nI'm  right now standing before some more major options for my life. I'm a  software developer (Junior Mobile Dev - I do mainly iOS but from time to  time I help out in Android project in our company). In November it will  be 1 year since I become professional developer, before I had an  technical cloud support role and been customer service in some VR games  places. So I'm pretty happy with myself and my progress through the  years mainly because I was programming for only 4 years now (since I  started my first studies which I eventually left for my Bachelor of  Informatics degree). Now I'm ending my Bachelor Degree in month or two.  I'm thinking about applying for Master degree in Germany or in some  other country in EU (Netherlands are on my list too :D). I'm from Poland  BTW so it is somewhat a big deal for me while I have really no love for  my country right now and always wanted to see how it is to live in some  foreign country for longer time. But it came to my mind: Did I really  need this masters degree? My studies right now aren't so appealing to  me, I learn much more in my job etc. I have possibility to work remote,  so I could probably just travel and work. What would you do on my  position? Do you think that Master degree will help my in anyway or  maybe it just waste of time if I'm passionate about my work and learning  by myself. (While all I learned for job interviews etc I just did of  pure interest, and outside studies curriculum.)",

    "title":"Considering leaving a great job for a 10-20% salary increase",
    "body":"Hi folks\n\nI've gone through a good chunk of r\/personalfinance and r\/cscareerquestions for insight and the answer to the post title definitely varies. I was hoping I could get some perspectives while I weigh the pros and cons of potentially leaving my current job which I am very comfortable in. \n\nI'm in the late stages of an interview process for a Solutions Engineering-type position at a large, high-profile tech company. While I do not like to count my eggs before they hatch, I've done this before and put off the planning\/consideration until the offer finally came and ended up rushing on the negotiation piece. I've received great feedback throughout the interview process which makes me think that it's definitely appropriate to begin this kind of decision making\n\nTimeline:\n\n2019 - Got laid off from a job that paid 85k \n\n2019 - Found a job that paid 90k \n\n2019 - That job ended up not being a great fit at all, found a different job that paid 115k \n\n2020\/2021 - Got a 5k raise to 120k\n\n2021 - Entertaining an opportunity that COULD pay 145-150k if I play my cards right per the feedback I've gotten from the interview process so far. Offer will more than likely start at around 135k per [h1binfo.info](https:\/\/h1binfo.info) (roughly a 12% increase)\n\nCurrent Job:\n\nPros: Great flexibility with time off and sick days, 30-minute max commute one way, absolutely wonderful coworkers, caring and empathetic management, great team culture, opportunity to learn a little about a whole lot of things (jack of all trades master of none), you are pushed to get 3rd party certifications, literally no micromanaging, respect work\/life balance and do not expect work off-hours, and they do not fire people\n\nCons: Current role does not translate into a career unless you want to go into management for the department, locked into my current role within the company for two years (I'm about a year and a half in), you are pushed to get 3rd party certifications, little flexibility with working hours (day always has to end at 5 no matter how early I start), 50-70% customer-facing which I want to get away from, standing customer engagements which I also want to get away from, generally most of the expected tasks have become tedious\/boring \n\nThis job that I'm at is probably tied for the best I've ever had and I've never had this kind of support from a Manager before - I had something of a nervous breakdown while dealing with some substance abuse issues a few months into quarantine. Without any hesitation, he gave me a whole week off and checked in on me to make sure that I was doing well. \n\nWith all of that said it is definitely a difficult choice for me to even consider leaving the company. However...\n\nWhat I know\/been told about the new position:\n\nI will be part of a new department within the company so there is an opportunity to be at the start of something from the ground up (fast-paced start-up style type of growth), flexible working hours, will be about 20% customer work (no scheduled, standing customer meetings only working on tickets), 45-60 minute commute one way, could potentially offer a shuttle to the office (still WFH until further notice, probably until August)\n\nI'm at a point in my life where it would behoove me to make as much money as I can until the next big thing, which is moving out of the country and marrying my fiance. I'm going to a place where 50k USD translates to 200k locally which you can live on very comfortably for about 3-4 years so it would be great to max out the USD earnings. This company that I am applying to also has offices in that country as well. While there might be a possibility for a transfer, there are roles there that I would be qualified for if I had to reapply\n\nWith all that said if the current job I was at wasn't almost perfect, this wouldn't be a difficult decision. I've always followed the money throughout my career in tech and it's worked out well so far which is why I'm feeling like I should do the same here. I'm also considering having that big name on my resume as well. But this time is definitely different and I for sure am heavily considering how great management has treated me up to this point. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this and to get this far. Any and all insights are appreciated! Thank you in advance",

I will be working Software Engineer Intern( though ill be mostly doing QA work hehehe)\n\nMy advice, don\u2019t give up. Keep trying because when you give up you\u2019ve admitted defeat. Also if you can\u2019t get an internship or a FT job, work as a volunteer part time, you will make alot of connections and you gain alot of experience. If not you\u2019re into that then work on side projects, they helped alot in making my application look more appealing.\n\nMy plan for the future is to get into my masters hopefully , grind Leetcode and DS and Algo and hopefully get another internship or a FT role.\n\nGood luck everyone, you will definitely succeed.\n\nLink to my sad post, I made a few months back: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/mnva5k\/cant_find_a_job_sad_post\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

Although that has not always been the case as i have a non-traditional background and decided to make a change back when covid hit and push myself as an individual.\"Then go into a little more detail on my background and college. I normally end the conversation with what i enjoy about development \"I really enjoy being able to create, test, and eval production application's\"\n\nI really want to refactor it and make it better to wow the interviewer. Any advice on some structure for the \"introduce yourself\"?\n\nI normally tend to get past the recruiters but worried that its taken into account when i meet with the engineer and my lack of experience is bad so want to make myself sound better without being too extra.\n\nAbout the company :\n\nI've researched about the company (they are a restaurant ordering platform that allows the company to view real time feedback on service and more) and i've worked in the hospitality industry so clearly understand the need for real time feedback , quick ordering, and focusing on the user's experience vs getting the order wrong and spoiling their experience.\n\nAny advice on anything i should do before this interviewer? BTW: The position is a Jr Software Engineer. Interview is tomorrow 11:30am Tuesday May 11th. So if you are viewing after then i have had the interview.\n\nTLDR: Interview tomorrow and need some advice on what to look up to WOW the interviewer. Also some advice on how to structure the \"tell me about yourself\".\n\nThanks all!",

    "body":"Edit: I started off this post with the intention of asking one thing but it changed somewhere along the way into the entire situation Im in.\n\nI'm a 2020 grad who started his first job in September. My company made all the new grads undergo a couple of months of basic training of things like Python, SQL, AWS etc. I finally joined my team in mid-December and after a couple of weeks of getting permissions, setting stuff up etc, I started getting assigned work from Jan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts been five months now and I have not really done much - the majority of tasks assigned to me are of one of these types:\n\n1. Bugs which have been resolved in other versions of the product, where I basically have to replicate the changes made. A lot of these are assigned to me with the idea that I will be exposed to diff parts of the codebase and get more functional knowledge of the product\n2. Minor UI changes\n3. Writing of some selenium tests which are pretty basic and generally follow the same format\n4. Automation related tasks - run an automation suite, analyze whether all tests passed. If not, raise issues for the ones which failed\n\nTo be very honest, I have gone into auto pilot mode the last couple of months. With the pademic still going on and the monotony of wfh, my motivation was completely gone. Back in 2020, I was interning at a 'better' company but due to multiple reasons, one of them being covid, I did not get a full time offer. Recently I had seen folks with < 1 YOE applying to and getting into some top companies which I had deemed unlikely as I thought companies would not be willing to hire someone who is between the 0-1 year mark in experience. But on seeing this, I started leetcoding and stopped putting any effort into my actual job. I had started basically copying the code changes which I needed to replicate without even trying to analyze them, procrastinate on the other work as well.   \n\n\nI ended up giving a few OAs (Linkedin and a few good local product companies) and did not get through them. On getting some advice from some more experienced people, I am considering staying put until around July -August when I can pass off as a 1 YOE guy and then applying again, and continuing to improve at LC in that time. But now its starting to hit me that it will soon be close to a year without me having done any actual coding and Im not sure what I will say when asked in interviews about my experience. I wanted to get this sub's opinion on this situation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone been in this sort of situation where they were not getting any major work as a new grad and their coding skills suffered as a result?\n\nI am considering applying to other places and am doing leetcode prep on the side. One thing which worries me is what I would say when asked about my contributions at my first company. All I can really say is that I completed my tasks(without being proactive tbh) and delivered requirements on time. Would this be accepted? I see so many people who put on their resumes about what they designed or built etc etc\n\nHow do I bring this up with my manager? Should I be honest with him that I had kind of slacked off the past couple of months and not been making an active effort to learn the codebase(which is insanely vast and I still am not confident with).",

This has been planned since before I even interviewed and I haven't brought it up yet.

    "body":"Hello everyone! I needed some help with a career move that has got me a bit stressed\n\nI graduated in 2019 with a degree in CS from a Kansas state school. I began to work at the same company I did my internship with (a very very large private corporation). Ive been there for about two years now and am leading a lot of development and architecture in my group as the lead has moved to a different team so the amount of work I have is substantially more than a year ago. I\u2019m in south central Kansas so cost of living is pretty low. \n\nI have been getting a lot of recruiters messaging me so I decided to see what was out there in the market. \n\nAfter a few interviews, I got an offer from a large consulting company (considered big 4 on the business side). \n\nNow I want to lay down my situation and see if anyone has any wise words. I don\u2019t have anyone in my personal life that I could speak to and could relate to my situation so I thought I\u2019d ask here. \n\nCurrent Compensation: 77k (possible 5k raise by end of this month). 401k matching, full benefits. Full time, salary, rarely work more than 40 hours. I\u2019ve really enjoyed my time here and enjoy the people I work with, although I would like to get out and experience more of the world since I was raised here in Kansas. There is also a strict business casual dress code and working remote or from home is very limited. \n\nNew offer: 95K, full remote, option to work in DC or Austin, TX if I prefer to have an office. Similar benefits although the 401k matching is a bit weaker ($0.25 per dollar up to 6% vs 100%% up to 6%). This gives me the chance to own my life a bit more and flexibility to move to a new city in the future without having to find a new job. \n\nI am feeling very stressed about this decision and not telling my current employer about the situation. I\u2019m worried that I could do poorly at the new job or be falling behind when at my current company I\u2019m doing extremely well. I am nervous about having the conversation of leaving etc. \n\nI\u2019ve never made a move like this in my professional career and I would really appreciate advice on whether I should take this offer or any advice anyone else can provide. \n\nThank you all very much!",

    "title":"Programming Career for Mechanical Engineer Major?",
    "body":"I'm exploring career options in programming and was wondering if anyone has advice or stories about segueing careers from engineering to programming. I like my current job, but I love learning new skill sets and want to become more competitive for future advancement. \n\nAs part of my engineering curriculum, I took classes in C and MATLAB and felt that I picked up the basics pretty well. The projects were pretty fun and thought provoking. My favorite was a Tic Tac Toe game with full GUI in MATLAB where I had to make the computer never lose. Then my senior mechanical engineering project had me write C code for an Arduino to control a few motors on a pendulum robot. There were also many other minor projects smaller in scope used to solve various assignments.\n\nI'm reading the \"Different Types of Programming Positions\/Jobs\" post and am having a difficult time deciding what I should start reading into. My issue is that I see and endless amount of resources to learn everything and I'm becoming overwhelmed just in deciding how to learn in a sensible way.\n\nSince I already know the basics of a couple languages should I just start by finding an interesting project and working to learn what I need to complete it? What is the best path to develop skills that are both useful and career oriented?",

It\u2019s a sales engineering\/solutions engineering job and if you\u2019re thinking about this type of job just know that it\u2019s not always what it seems. \n\nI was told the job would be 70% coding 30% customer facing, but a year in, the coding is nonexistent and I feel like my brain is smoothing out in this role lol. Lots of times I\u2019m just learning things on my own or taking courses during work hours and when work does come in, it\u2019s so unfulfilling and uninteresting I want to blow my brains out. To make things worse, we get pointless training after training. I could write a novel about how stupid this shit is. People leave this role all the time because they realize how dumb it is, but I\u2019ve stayed partly because I\u2019ve gotten comfortable collecting my paycheck and partly because I\u2019m not sure how to transition out of this job.\n\nI\u2019m thinking of putting in my 2 weeks to learn things I want to learn and apply to better jobs. I\u2019ve even been considering grad school, because maybe it\u2019s my knowledge that\u2019s the issue. Yes, I know I can do this while in my current role but the guilt of not doing shit in my current role and the stress of work being put on me is making me feel depressed as shit. Has anyone left their job to do something similar, with no next job aligned. Is this frowned upon? I feel like I\u2019m in a sticky situation here and don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice helps.",

The issues I had with the PhD (in Denmark ) was the fact that I wasn\u2019t allowed direct entry into the programme and had to do 2 years of a masters to reach the danish standard and essentially after 6 months at it I got completely disheartened and burned out as i had to split my time into doing a full masters load , teaching and also planning and heavy prep work for the PhD . My issue was that I was working 7 days a week and having almost 0 time to actually dedicate to my PhD and with the lockdown rules I think matters just became worse as I was in a new surrounding without any support locked up and with very little social interaction or even free time and breathing space  . Bottom line is that I really want to pursue research , specifically in HCI and using technology as means of accessibility for people with various disabilities ( my initial focus was on limited motor skills ) . Is there any way I could pursue this given my academic experience + 4 years of software development experience or are there any suggestions for alternative paths ?\n\nThank you for your time and insights",

    "body":"I'm now on my 7th month with my 2nd team at my current job as a software developer. I moved to this office with the aim to learn more.\n\nPIP - is Performance Improvement Plan. I know that it's given to an employee if he fails to meet the target for a period. \n\nToday, I was invited to a meeting with no subject which I attended. To my surprise, it wasn't about regularization, instead it was about PIP that I never was warned before.\n\nOur office is a contractor and has clients abroad. During the meeting, my manager simply showed a PIP form and explained that it's being issued to me because I didn't meet the metrics and expectation of client. That's when I started to get confused. \"No specific metrics were discussed to me since I joined\" I thought that I jist need to work on the task assigned to me per sprint.\n\nSome of the metrics\/target I saw on the PIP are about ensuring at least >=10 lines of code merged per sprint, ensuring that you avoid getting task carried over to next sprint etc. All of which were never discussed to me since I joined the company. And now, there I was in the meeting being issued a PIP right on my face when I wasn't even oriented about the goals. No warning, no monitoring, just straight PiP that they said I need to acknowledge.\n\nI expressed my confusion and feelings about it to my manager(contractor side) and he told me that they will help and that I just need to get through it. In other words, just accept it. And that they didn't know about those specific metrics of client, which I find a miss on their part. They just told me that my feedback will be communicated and feedback is appreciated.\nI got so pissed because I think it is so unjust and unfair to just issue a PIP to an employee when on the other hand it's them who failed to communicate to me what my metrics are. And I'm on my 7th month, not even a year. How the hell would I know those specific targets if they don't identify and ask those from client. There are sprints where there are only UX tasks. (I do backend btw)\n\nTheir miss, my record\/reputation's expense.\n\nSorry, I'm a little getting carried away.\nNow, I've been thinking that I wouldn't want to stay in an office with that kind of system and management. I'm only on my7th month. In my previous offices, shortest stay was 2.5years.\n\nI am now planning to look for another office and apply actively then leave my current office once hired.\n\nBut, I would like to know your thoughts and advice on this matter. Cause maybe, someone here had experienced something similar. What did you do OR What would you do if I were you?\n\nTo add, our client in US, recently laid off their employees in US. \n\nYour thoughts will help.\n\nThank you!",

This is all good news and feels like it would be good career move but I'm a) out of practice in this sort of thing and b) a little thrown by the technical exercise they've asked me to complete as the first part of the application. \n\nThey've asked for an API which loads data from a csv file and then performs certain actions on it based on user input - I'm confident enough I can work out the logic etc for what they want the API to do (it's mostly just basic maths) but I'm a bit thrown by how they've asked for this. I've only really encountered API's through a web development course while I was studying so I'm a bit lost as to whether they're asking for a simple program performing these actions, or evidence of it sitting within a larger framework. Is this a common approach to technical challenges, and if so what would a potential employer be expecting from this?",

    "body":"The work will be in video analytics from live video streaming, and the startup seems to have recently been given seed funding. Headcount is +\/-10 persons, likely fewer. \n\nThe interview was an exploration of my technical background and research work in ML and CV as a grad student. I was given a take home assignment trying to demo an open source piece of software which I managed to complete, and was then given an offer to come aboard. \n\nI get to pick my title, which will likely be along the lines of Applied ML or Computer Vision Enginner. I have no idea how to negotiate a competitive paycheck in this situation since I only have a faint idea of how much their initial funding is, and only a guesstimate of the headcount. \n\nI've checked with peers and read Glassdoor salary insights for ML Engineering roles. For 1-3 years of experience, the average pay seems to be $130k, with a minimum of $90k.

I plan to learn that area of work during weekends and over the next few years before I am ready to take freelance work. Ideally, I want the specialization to be:\n\n\\- in demand in future\n\n\\- Pay per hour should be good and there should be a steep increment as I become more skilled\n\n\\- Should be interesting so that I look forward to learning that skill and do not back out in between, that's subjective but feel free to include your biases\n\nThese are the ideal points, I realize that the fulfillment of all the conditions might not be practical. Regarding my background, I am 26, having 3 years of work experience, currently working in the financial services sector.

    "title":"A Rant And Could Really Use Some Advice - At A Crossroads In My Career",
    "body":"TL;DR - Coming from IT and working in first DevOps role and it's a nightmare. I'm absolutely lost on where to go from here.\n\nTo start, I'm in Canada so I don't know what it's like to be able to apply to hundreds of jobs a week. I don't really have that opportunity where I live.\n\nI'm a little over 3 years in the industry at this point. I worked at an MSP to start. Worked up from the help desk to a project based role and landed a DevOps position 8 months ago. It took time to land this role. I dedicated a lot of personal time to studying, getting certified (Azure Administrator), and working on personal projects.\n\nThings started out ok. I've worked a lot with AWS, Terraform, GitLab for pipelines, a ton of bash scripting, collaborating with devs. I've honestly learned a lot and have done some really cool things with Terraform that I'm proud of but it's really turned out to be a nightmare overall.\n\nThis company is about 50 employees total, been around for about 10 years, and I'm the sole DevOps person there. This is my first DevOps position and I was brutally upfront about my skills and experience but showed a willingness to learn which helped me land this role. Here's some issues I'm having:\n\n* First and foremost, the CEO is a bit nuts. He singles people out in chat and asks things like \"Why did you do this?\" \"Why didn't this person catch this?\" anytime something goes wrong. He flips out anytime there is any issues whatsoever, dropping F bombs in chat when something happens. He micromanages everyone. He'll directly message me repeatedly all throughout the day asking me to look into whatever so happened to cross his periphery at that time which he's now deemed critical. I don't get clear instructions on requirements from him at all.\n* I spoke with my manager about the CEO micromanaging me and he has backed off a little bit recently, but it's still there, and there are so many other problems with this person that just make it really hard to work with him.\n* The CEO \"doesn't do\" tickets, any message received from him in chat is good enough and I should drop everything I'm doing to look into whatever he's asking and most of the time it's way above me. I can't communicate with him through tickets either, I need to chase him down in chat anytime I need clarification on something because he never answers.\n* We have project managers that are absolutely useless. Everything is critical, everything needs to be done by end of day, no clear instructions from them ever.\n* Developers never stop working. This especially includes the CEO. I receive messages from him at 3 AM asking for my thoughts on things, or asking me to fix a deployment he messed up, because despite the fact I've done multiple personal calls with him to walk him through the deployment process, and written detailed documentation complete with screenshots, he still circumvents it, looks for shortcuts, messes things up, then flips out when everything breaks in the middle of the night because he decided to deploy to production.\n* My role isn't clearly defined to anyone else. Everyone thinks I'm the administrator of every single system we have and service we use. Anytime there's the slightest issue with anything I need to drop what I'm doing and fix it. It wouldn't be so much of a problem, but we have like 50+ random EC2 instances that were set up before my time and there is no documentation for any of it. I would love to clean this up, reduce systems, find better ways to run them that's more inline with best practices but I'm honestly just firefighting all day with developers and random other things that get assigned to me.\n* I have no time to really dive into some other things I would like to help grow as a DevOps Engineer. There are so many tools and processes I would love to research and attempt to look into but honestly with the way it's been with the CEO who doesn't listen, doesn't bother using processes I've set up, flips out when there's problems, I've just lost all motivation and desire to even try implementing anything else or improving anything.\n* I've been volunteered as the head of all security policies and runbooks, despite the fact I'm not actually writing anything at all it's being done behind the scenes without my involvement yet they put my name on documents.\n* No documentation for anything except for what I've wrote for the processes \/ pipelines I've developed. I'm coming from IT and have a solid background in documentation, it's something I've always placed a great deal of importance with.\n* No monitoring aside from some pretty useless CloudWatch alerts \/ dashboards we have set up. I would love to really dive into this area, and load testing as well, but see my point above regarding the CEO. I've honestly just lost all motivation to start on anything like this because of him.\n* No leads. No code reviews. Everything is under the birds eye view of the CEO. There are people who direct deployments, but they're not developers. There are so many issues with deployments I don't even know where to start.\n* Devs connect to production databases for development.\n* Things are way too fast. I'm talking deployments to production causing issues, anything I ever work on needs to be done ASAP as well. I'm not part of any discussions or meetings outside of the daily standups which are a joke.\n* Daily standups are absolutely useless. The project managers just talk about what's being deployed for 5 mins, while everyone else sits in silence in the call, but then I get singled out and asked what I'm working on and when it will be done. No one has any idea of what I'm talking about and it just feels so awkward.\n\nDespite all of the above, it honestly started out well when I was less in contact with the CEO. I got to really dive into Terraform and AWS, and had fun setting up and learning new things. The pipelines I developed were challenging but fun to work on, and I love seeing them in action. I love helping people, and collaborating with devs to accomplish this stuff with them.\n\nNow, I just look at the place and see how much wrong there is and I can't fix all of it. I can't fix the culture. I can't change the CEO. I can't fix everything I'd like to on AWS or our processes. It's all just such a mess and I'm so overwhlemed. I'm filled with anxiety every time I start something when there's something else that's being put off that I should do. It's unsustainable.\n\nI took the last week off and have been hammering out applications (I've actually been doing this for the past month), but I'm getting nothing back.

    "title":"Non-CS Grad Seeking Guidance for Career Path",
    "body":"I am looking to enter the Software Development scene. I have my BBA in Marketing, but originally wanted to get a degree in CS however this never happened due to my lack of knowledge of how college really worked (First Gen Graduate). I got my general undergrad coursework done at a local community college and then transferred to a state college, during this process I found out that if I wanted to get a degree in CS, that I would basically have to retake much of my general coursework as it was going to require that I get much of the foundational coursework done despite already having my associate degree. So essentially I was looking at going to school for another 3-4 years to get a CS degree vs continuing with a business degree in 2 years. Due to financial\/time constraints, I went the BBA route (and highly regret this decision).\n\nTwo years ago I graduated with my BBA and have been unable to find anything professionally in the field. I am about to turn 25 years old and am feeling like if I want to make a career\/field change, now is the time to do it. It doesn't help I'm not really interested in Marketing, but I am interested in software dev as I feel that it would be much more in my spectrum of interests and fit me as a person better. I have a little self-taught knowledge of python\/html\/css\/js, but nothing significant enough to gain employment. My hope would be to utilize something of my Marketing degree, potentially the UX\/UI knowledge that I gained during my studies.\n\nJust some background info: I am married and my wife and I both have income, I would be able to work part-time and attend school\/camp if the opportunity arose. She makes enough income to support us both if necessary for a period of time. I live in Arkansas, while there are not a vast amount of employment opportunities in my city, we live pretty close to Little Rock which has some SE jobs posted pretty regularly, though we would be willing to move if necessary. \n\nMy question is this, what would be the best route in my case to reach employment in the SE field?\n\n1.) I have been accepted to my local community college for pursuing a second bachelor in CS, my situation is similar to when I was in college the first go around, I will require all of the foundational classes and since this would be my second bachelor, I would be paying out of pocket\/getting loans to pay. Either way, I assume it would be helpful to take some of the intro to CS classes there.\n\n2.) Should I seek a masters degree in CS? There is a college here that offers a \"Master of Computer and Information Science\" degree online and though it prefers students who have a CS background, it does allow for non-cs majors to apply after taking a couple of pre-req courses. This option seems like a good choice, but I get unsure when I consider the fact that I most likely will be lacking a lot of the core foundational knowledge of CS.\n\n3.) I've also considered attending a coding camp though I am a little weary of them. I've looked into Hack Reactor\/App Academy\/Coding Dojo. I like the idea of getting instant industry applicable skills, but I've also heard\/seen some sort of shady stuff with some of the Bootcamps. I also wouldn't be able to lump sum pay for something like this so would need to consider the different financing options.\n\nWow, this post ended up a lot longer than I had hoped for, my apologies, and thank you for your input!\n\n**tl:dr- Non-CS grad seeking SE career. Would the best route of entry be a second bachelor in CS? Master in CS\/MCIS through potential online college or bridge program? Coding Bootcamp?**",

Is it worthwhile for me to pursue a post-bacc in CS and possibly a master's to follow? Relying on being self-taught seems risky for job prospects and employers; I would imagine a bootcamp-type program would be better, but how marketable is it? Is it possible for someone to shadow or intern to learn and gain experience, or would I seem bizarre starting to ask companies for this opportunity?\n\nI'll also add that I have a good friend who earned his bachelor's degree in computer science and it took him a year to find a job.

    "body":"I'm a Senior Engineer. My team's manager got moved to another team and my lead got promoted to manager. The lead put in his 2-weeks notice, so our team is basically manager-less. This is why our Director of Engineering is managing us right now.\n\nI've been working at this company for 8 months and had my first performance review comprised of nothing but great feedback. \n\nI had my first two 1-1s with the director, the first of which was very casual, but the next was a shocker. I was called out on:\n\n1. Having too many PRs open, closed, and in draft\n2. Having too many commits\n3. Too many comments from others in my PRs\n4. Pushing commented code & code with git artifacts in it\n\nIn my defense:\n\n1. Since the start of the quarter, my team has reprioritized a lot of work, and there hasn't been a discussion about what to do with the work that we all started. Also, I open a draft PR the moment I make my first commit on a branch. I do this for visibility, and in case someone needs to take over the work.\n\n2. I also commit a lot. Commits are my safety net. I use `git reset` tremendously throughout the day to go back to different states in the code I'm working on.\n\n3. The director mentioned that he expects senior engineers to have very little chatter on their PRs. They should be ready to merge with very little discussion. What he failed to recognize that were almost all of the comments on my PRs are from Hound, our linter. Rather than linting before pushing, I actually enjoy waiting for Hound's comments and fixing them afterward.\n\n4. Here I made a mistake. I've been forced to comment out code recently in some of our microservices as a temporary fix while working locally. I forgot to uncomment the code before pushing to GitHub. The director went through my commits and saw some commit messages like \"uncomment code\", \"remove commented block\", and reprimanded me for that.\n\nI've been an engineer for more than 10 years and no one has called me out on any of this. This is how I like to work. I don't see a real problem here. \n\nI can squash my commits, lint locally, and stay blocked when services aren't working on my machine. But I'm mostly concerned about why this director is calling out this bullsh*t.\n\nI spoke to my former manager, and he said it'd just be easier to appease him. But it feels like the director is looking for a reason to let me go by finding incompetencies in my performance. I do not want to work in fear or with paranoia.\n\nShould I have a chat with the director's manager to ask about the feedback and what he suggests I do about it?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**BONUS**\n\nAnother reason I think this feedback may be in bad taste is because of this:\n\nWe've recently been given one of those typical sexual harassment training assignments which were to be complete in a month (due, say, May 15). On my day off last week, I got an email from the director saying, \"I know you're OOO, but we need you to finish the sexual harassment training **today**.\" After checking my email, it was still due May 15th, not May 8th. I completed it, of course (to shut him up), but that still leaves me with one question: Why would this guy message me on my day off with such urgency to complete something that was not even due? It feels like he's really trying to catch me slacking.",

I know because I work with the outsourced team (they're embedded into the company as opposed to being a separate division). \n\n(Just a little disclaimer - all my co-workers are lovely and I don't think any of their comments or actions are in malice - they genuinely all believe you don't need to code as a developer and some of them are very experienced)",

However, I can tell you I'm looking for something within the range xxx-xxx with a minimum of xxx.**\" \n\nHe was like okay and then went on to a different question for a couple minutes then circled back again to the same topic. I asked \"**What's the compensation range for the role you're recruiting for?**\" and he replied with - \"**There is no set range. My client is quite open with the compensation levels as they're looking to hire various levels of experience.

    "body":"Hi everyone, \n\nI am so lost and would really appreciate any advice that you all can give me.\n\nLet's get the basics out of the way first. \n\nI am now 28 years old and have not been in school for about 7 years now. I have only been working in dead end jobs like being a cashier at target and McDonald's for a long time now. I'm very depressed from the poor decisions I have made in life and am yearning to make a change for the better this time.\n\nSo, fast forward to today. I've come to understand and believe that the tech industry will be the future and have some of the best paying jobs out there. I've been reading that there are three different paths to take in breaking into a career in this field. Getting a college degree in computer science, being self taught, or going by way of bootcamps. \n\nThe college route seems like it may be a safer route (correct me if I'm wrong, please), but it also seems like it will cost the most time and money to do so. I have completed some education at my community college many years ago. I mapped out a potential plan with a college counselor, and it would take me 3 years to finish my time at community college, then transfer to a university, which would take another 2 years to finally achieve my bachelor's degree in computer science. That's 5 years in total, PROVIDED that I am able to pass every single class that I take.\n\nFor someone that is serious about making this a career path for themselves, which path would you recommend them to take?",

    "title":"Need Guidance to Pick between two Support IT roles",
    "body":" Hey Everyone,\n\nI was recently (mid April) Laid off my L1 position where I was contractually working as an L1 Technical Support with a Cloud Project\/Process Integration for one of biggest companies in the workspace for a period of one year. I was very much bothered by lack of interest from the management to promote from within despite people working crazy hours or outworking every other colleague. Also for note, this is my only IT experience.\n\nI followed this subreddits as well as [r\/ITCareerQuestions](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cscareerquestions\/) guidance on Resumes, interviews, salaries, career progressions and other.\n\nBecause of that I found myself with two offers in two differing companies. I was not able to decide which one to follow with since.\n\n**Company A.) Graduate Technical Support Specialist**  \n27.500 Euro a year \\~ 25 days off \\~ no other benefits.\n\nThe Company provides software akin to Mobility Management and other things. The type of work as L1 support will allow me to tackle any issues as L1's take full ticket ownership, so if there is a very difficult ticket I can work on it to try and solve if its not over my head.\n\nThis will make me be able to do a work that I enjoy in stable office hours and work with corporate clients who know what they're doing to some degree. I can also work outside of working hours to work on my specific ticket. There's no HelpDesk or anything of the sort so they do not handhold you and wave numbers and quotas above your head.\n\nBecause of nature of the company I think the progress within it will be slow, but they use different interesting technologies and focus on networking a lot which I could apply in day-to-day basis.\n\nIf not for benefits + School which I will explain below I would chose this one.\n\n**Company B.)** **Customer Support Specialist**  \n32.000 Euro a year +5% p\/a bonus \\~ 25 days off full dental + health cover for me&fam + other benefits\n\nThis Corporation deals with GRC and in the last year they have opened a new customer support hub that will be the only support hub globally. They use random shifts with new employee logging in on every hour to ensure constant coverage and the job is being done via HelpDesk where the clients call to the customer support representatives.\n\nThey have again and again highlighted that they want technically gifted people to be selected from L1 candidates within about half a year so they can fill up tens of new positions as once again they opened this support hub semi recently so those positions are being made\/waiting to be filled.\n\nThey will be looking at numbers and I need to be by my station 24\/7 as it often happens with HelpDesk types of scenarios. Also they look at metrics and it scares me a lot because I would love to help people to the best of my ability instead of pushing them out asap.\n\nAlso, those strange working hours would more easily allow me to finish my Software Dev Undergrad where I miss only three classes that need to be taken during the day AND I need to get my dental work done.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI have about 25k saved so I'm not in the worst place monetarily but I'm not sure if I want to take the jump into a work I could potentially hate for half a year where I will know what's what or start looking elsewhere.\n\nThe first Job is more interesting but has lower salary and benefits, as well as possibly much slower progress, but I would enjoy it more and it would be more of technical challenge. The second I will be stressing over metrics over months and hoping they pull me over for something more technical than learning product from 'the kitchen', while simultaneously they provide better benefits\/pay and perhaps a career opportunity.\n\nSorry if I'm rambling, I have gotten zero sleep at night over this and thank you everyone for weeks of supporting people here which helped me in turn as well.\n\nThanks everyone!",

    "body":"Hello guys, I am a self-taught web developer, I started learning front-end at the end of last year, I've landed two jobs as a front-end dev with REACT, both of the jobs were really bad(on the company policy part, one of them was against my rights), after those two jobs, I soon realized I am more interested in the backend development, so after quitting, I studied a month of basic backend knowledge and then landed an internship as a backend engineer in a start-up.\n\nDuring the internship, though my position was called \"backend engineer\", but my duty was actually using AWS CDK to do IAC for our service, I had a great time learning cloud services and knowledge about internet, and the crew was really nice to me. But because of the company's lack of budget, they had to let go all the devs including me. After this short but awesome experience, I was almost certain that I want to be a backend Dev in the future, so I started to develop my own side project.  I am an admin in an English study group and we hold events every week, I decided to created a web app to optimize the registration process so I started develop it with something I haven't tried out yet. \n\nRight now the first version of my app is done on the backend, but because of my friend (she's in charge of UI designing), my side project is not ready to be deployed yet, so I thought maybe I could demonstrate my backend code and get into the job market.\n\nAfter a week of browsing and applying some of the junior jobs, I feel a bit frustrated, I feel like I suit most of the junior job and still feel like I don't. I really don't know what should I do now, should I keep searching for the job? or should I learn something else? \n\nIf I should learn something else, where should I go? should I keep optimizing my backend service, or just keep learning new things? My friend always tells me to \"master\" one thing, and I honestly don't know where to start, I am currently learning data structures, CS knowledges and algorithms when I am not searching for jobs, is that sufficient? I've been considering maybe getting a AWS certificate, but I really don't know if it helps since $150 is quite expensive for me at the moment..\n\nI truly love this industry and the knowledge of everything about this, but I just feel so lost in this sea of tools, languages and knowledge.. \n\nWhat do you guys suggest?",

    "body":"As someone who has just recently graduated from a CS bachelors program, I have no idea what benefit I have over someone who graduated from, say, only a bootcamp (all else being equal), and I have been having a hard time finding the answer to this question. The closest answer I have gotten is that 'bootcamp grads usually can't apply to embedded entry level jobs.' (No hate to bootcamp grads though. All respect for anyone trying to hustle to make something of themselves in this world.)\n\nI have heard so much rhetoric about the different types of jobs available to SENG and CS grads, and how those grads don't make 'software stacks'(MERN, MEAN, etc.) their main selling point as a bootcamp grad might. I have heard that once you start defining youself by these stacks, then that usually means you are a web developer. I don't want to become a web developer at the end of the day, but I don't know what to look for in an entry level job description that will keep me off that path.\n\nWhat I am trying to point out, is that there seems to clearly be some distinction about the doors that a CS degree can open, but looking at the market and job ads in Canada, I can't seem to see that distinction in entry level positions. Either the job ads are asking you to be familiar in some software stack and the job is web-dev related, or the experience and tech required is so absurd that I find it hard to believe that any fresh grad would have that experience. I have only checked linkedin job ads though. \n\nWhat kind of entry jobs should I be looking for as a fresh CS grad (and as such, are available to me as a fresh grad), where I would generally not be competing with bootcamp grads? By this I mean, what search filters should I be using to find such positions, or what should I look for in job descriptions to keep me away from jobs heavily applied to by bootcamp grads? It is hard to not sound condescending when asking this question but know it is not my intention.",

    "body":"Hi all,\n\nI am currently a CS major and a senior in standing. I switched from biology to software engineering the end of my sophomore year, so I was very behind and in order to graduate on time and to save me thousands of dollars (from taking extra semesters) I took about 3 summer classes each summer on top of the usual 4-5 classes during a normal semester. I am about to graduate soon, but since I have been rushing and catching up with the large amounts of classes I needed to take in a quick time, I've had no time for internships or any real world situations. Graduating without an internship I feel like is going to make it super hard to get an entry level job, as employers would probably hire someone that has had an internship or CS work experience over me.\n\nHas anyone here been in the same boat? Or has tips for what I should do to stand out as a good hire? I have a few projects on my github, and my senior group project is pretty decent (but is focused on cybersecurity not software engineering).",

    "body":"Hello fine people of reddit. This is going to be an explanation of my situation with a friendly request of pep talk\/advice at the end. \n\nBit of background: I graduated 4 years ago with a CS-lite degree. \nIt's focus being on networking and security with a side of information management. It taught me the fundamentals of how to troubleshoot effectively, think critically, and most importantly self teach. Now due to my youthful foolish college ways I graduated with a not so attractive GPA (2.7 but whose counting). As such I pounced on the first job offered which ended up being entirely SQL based. Though I had exposure to SQL it wasn't something I had known in depth. Despite this the requirements for the job were low as was the pay. (I'm not trying to sound ungrateful, it remains one of the biggest pride points for me though now being slightly seasoned I am aware what the standards for the industry are.)\n\n\nFast forward a couple years, I am still in the same city I moved to for the job. I have established friends and a girlfriend I'm very happy with, things are nice. (Enter life and uncertainty) The small software company I work for gets bought out and recent restructurings have made me want to look elsewhere.\n\n\nMy personal problem is that I've been on a SQL only diet for about 4 years now and getting mixed messages from the internet as to the viability of that skillset long-term. My preferences for work I have found are being back of house interfacing with customers as little as required though I can do it when necessary and get complimented on my people skills. What I want to do isn't being a BA or manager-type however it's to be a dev\/software engineer. I know I need a real scripting\/programming language to move into that but it's all so daunting. I've been saying for a year now I'm gonna learn C# (my shop is .NET) but have not nearly but in enough hours to even grasp the fundamentals.\n\n\nIn all honesty half the reason I'm even looking towards other jobs and at my career is I don't want to be stuck with the legacy doom projects all my colleagues are leaving me with. I have a general sense of what I want and now have urgency but I simply lack the skills to make it happen. Do I do leetcode? Do I get back to school to get a CS degree? Bootcamp? There's so many options and it's overwhelming me into a mode where I do nothing and simply try not to think about it.\n\n\n**TLDR; Database dev wants to be a real dev\/swe and is in paralysis on how to achieve.**\n\n\nGonna leave the tag as experience.....it's just the wrong experience haha....",

I lost my job found contract work and I was out of work for a little while at the beginning of the year. Two weeks ago I started a new position after two technical conversation interviews. I was offered a new position and my gut feeling was to hold out and keep applying. I did not follow my gut feeling and ended up accepting it. Here is the part where I feel a bit baited.\n     During my initial conversation I was told this position would be on site and that the team was currently commuting to the location of the client (kind of far from the main office). I was told that there were other developers working on the project actively. On the day that I start I am told no one has started on that assignment and it may not even happen. My current assignment is getting up to speed with a technology (AWS) I have not worked with for the potential opportunity to work with a client. I've done a little background on their past teams conversations and it seems like a lot of people left last year due to no new projects. I feel like I am being benched already, I've talked with managers about how better I can spend my time day to day. The conversations have not really gone anywhere. I'm currently trying to look for other positions to keep myself ready in case of the worst case, but I wanted another opinion. I feel mislead on what I was getting into, but at the same time I need to try my best to keep work duties as expected.

    "body":"I'm currently in Program Management (I am currently the PMO Manager) and am tired of the project management world. I ended up here by unfortunately chasing money and authority. I was chasing the dream of executive management, but now that I am working daily with VPs and C-level people I realize it is nothing but massive problem after problem, politics, and long hours (evenings and weekend). I also realize my job has too much responsibility, too much stress, and is too people oriented. I think about my work 24\/7 - I wake up in the night thinking about it.  That said there are tons of perks with my job, I have complete freedom over what I do each day (it is 100% up to me what I do - sometimes this drives me nuts) and no one is watching me work (I'm supposed to be watching others work). Every now and then I get into incredibly interesting initiatives and see first hand how the business is run from the top level. But I just can't see myself doing this for another 20 years.\n\nWhen I look back on my university scores I realized that my best grades were in programming. I loved programming, and was good at it, but I was always afraid it would be flooded with cheap labour and it wouldn't continue to pay well. Now that I am in a management position I can clearly see that will never happen - the quality from offshore firms is dumpster-tier and we only leave the most basic menial programming jobs to offshore. (sorry to my offshore friends- every now and then I meet one of you that is rockstar-tier).\n\nAll this said - has anyone else been in my position? Did you make the jump and how did it go? I'm afraid I'm going to miss the massive freedom I have in my position, the direct access to upper management for mentorship, the high pay ($125K+ base in a non- tech hub). That said I would love love love to have someone just tell me what to do and I can pop in some earbuds and sit down and code away in peace. I am not a social person, but I'm also not a recluse - I enjoy talking with people and making friends (something that went up in smoke once I got my first management post). But for the most part I am happier to be working solo.\n\nMy degree was a mix business\/information technology, so I already have a base of programming, database, systems analysis -  I'm not starting from zero. Plus I've been around the IT world for 15 years. I've done hundreds of interviews and I can interview really well. I am thinking of going Python + Javascript + SQL route to build a baseline full stack skillset. I know html\/CSS already. My biggest concern is getting a position that I can learn in. Oh yeah, I'm 45 so I wonder if this is going to be an issue.\n\nAny feedback from someone who has already been here is appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. if you are in the opposite situation (going from software dev to project management) message me if you need any advice. I'm happy to help but I'd rather keep this thread clean for people in the same situation looking for advice.",

    "body":"Hi, I have a Bachelor's in chemistry from an Ivy League institution, and will be receiving my PhD in chemistry from another Ivy League institution next year. However, I doubt those degrees will mean much in computer fields \ud83d\ude04. I am primarily working in health sciences-related chemistry (ie therapeutics) so it's not like my math is exceptionally strong\u2014 though I have taken multivar calc and linear algebra in college. After spending so many years in the lab, I realized that I don't really want to be a chemist for the rest of my life, and I'm not at all interested in staying in labwork. I also strongly dislike academic culture. And I much prefer to work at a computer.\n\n\nRight now I'm working through The Odin Project, which gears you up for webdev. I'm not that entirely interested in webdev as a career, but from what I read, it is easier to get a job in as self-taught. As a chemist, I enjoy brainstorming solutions and thinking about troubleshooting issues but I don't actually enjoy the physical labor of chemistry (I'm not interested in working with statistics so thats why I have ruled out cheminformatics and data science related to health sciences).\n\n\nSo,\u00a0 I think I would be into software engineering but the barriers of entry seem much higher. And I have been in school so long, IDK if I want to go back just for a CS degree lol.\u00a0I don't mind self learning at my own pace though. Or  online Master's are even worth it?  My plan is to finish The Odin Project (Ruby on Rails pathway), do some projects, then learn C\/C++ and read a couple computer science books (like on DSA) but then what?\u00a0 How to translate webdev projects into software engineering skills and demonstrate competence to land a job in software engineering? Or should I be pursuing a junior web dev job (with focus on backend) after, to get experience\u00a0 and transition? Any thoughts appreciated",

In my opinion he quit because there was way to many expectations from him for how much little time he had. I just felt that my boss didn\u2019t understand how ML development works.\n\nHe and I have been talking a lot (prior to him quitting) and we agreed that the code the contractors wrote were pretty bad and probably had to be rewritten. He also said this to the manager in his resignation letter (I got to see if because he sent all the work he was doing).\n\nI\u2019ve tried to lead the team by myself but the more I coded the more I realized that I needed to research more. After reading 20 or so research papers I now have a great understand of what worked for other people and techniques in which to build a better (more functioning) system.\n\nTomorrow my self and 2 of the managers are meeting to discuss the interview process for our potential new hire.

My understanding is that Charlotte might be a good to choice to stay in(provided the office opens back up and I\u2019m not ramped off the client in 6 months) with my current skills and needs but what are other cities for me to consider?\n\n\nGiven my circumstances, I obviously want to live in a place where programmers don\u2019t have to move to find jobs. I\u2019m trying to start a family and can\u2019t commit to moving every year or two anymore. Also, a place where programmers are paid competitively against the housing market. (I\u2019m sure there are some cities where even a minimal six figure salary is \u201ctoo expensive\u201d but where a decent house in a respectable neighborhood is close to half a million dollars).  Other considerations is that I want to live in a diverse city that has good public education and a good reputation for Civil Rights. Climate is a big issue too in that I want to find a place that is relatively moderate.\n\nCharlotte and Atlanta kind of fits the bill but only to a point. I\u2019m also considering Denver, but am concerned about the lack of diversity and the bad winters and Seattle (maybe I need to take a boot camp or create an app in a popular stack about my dog or something), but am concerned that I don\u2019t have the skills to get a job there. Maybe Washington? But am worried that I can\u2019t get a clearance because I had bad credit until recently. I\u2019ve heard Austin is good but I\u2019m pretty skeptical.

However, there aren't many opportunities in my (developing) country so I want to go abroad to a developed country.

I am a competitive programmer and I think I have a pretty good chance of passing any coding interview if I am given the chance, but I am afraid that my country of origin will prevent me from getting interviews. Thankfully, I know some people in my CP circle who can give me referrals for several FAANG companies, but how much of a chance do I have even after getting a referral?

The work is more project management based and hasn't really allowed me to delve into technical\/analysis work which has led to me looking into software\/tech as a potential career change. That being said my salary is above average for a graduate engineer, given the workload will become more intense as I progress.\n\nAfter enrolling and making progress on a beginner Python course from Udemy (which I've been really enjoying) I've been heavily considering my options on how to make this potential transition.\n\nI've dm'd a few individuals within this community regarding this, and have gotten excellent advice, but I would like to hear a more general consensus (if possible) regarding my situation.\n\nAt the moment I'm trying to spend my free-time both at work and at home to learn programming and any relevant skills.\n\nThe biggest concern I have is how and when I can make the transition into working within the tech space, with software dev more specifically.\n\nMy current plan is to do whatever I can on the side, and look out for any potential opportunities whilst continuing with this 2 year program for ATLEAST the next year.\n\nSome questions I have to the wider community more specifically:\n\nWill the next year be enough to learn programming, upskill and complete projects to a level enough for entry-level roles in the space?\nWould it be more important to go back to Uni and get a relevant comp sci degree (would be about 2 years given my free electives and such are eaten by my mech eng. courses) to help in my learning and garnering a formal qualification\nI've considered doing an online masters degree in something like data science or cyber security (which I can complete whilst working) but I'm not sure how relevant these could be for programming as a whole + it would require some prior knowledge I'd assume\nI do know that my current role will become more intense as I progress through the project lifecycle and become more involved with longer days\/hours leaving less free-time for study which is why I'm considering a second degree.\n\nApart from that, any advice on potential next steps and how to move forward would really help solidifying my plan for the future.\n\nIf there's any more information I can provide please let me know.\n\nThanks everyone in advance.",

I've been asking a lot of questions and learning outside of work just so I can catch up ASAP.

It's quite reassuring to hear these words and your guys' help in this matter. I hope to continue ramping up productivity in the near future.",

I did have some interviews at the start of the pandemic but none of those turned into offers.\n\nAs a result of this, I enrolled in graduate school and am on track to graduate in December of this year. However, it's been tough to get an internship this time and I currently do not have one for the upcoming summer. \n\nIt's just been a very difficult time (I know not just for me but for everyone really) and I'm wondering if employers would care about my lack of internships\/technical jobs since September 2019? I've done research in grad school and have published one paper until now but that's been the only big change in my resume aside from a couple of new side projects and my new degree (MS CS). \n\nFinally, how should I explain this gap if asked in an interview for a new grad position this fall?",

I started programming last year and racked up exactly 240 hours in JS and a little HTML & CSS before I stopped for my last semester of college. I spent 4-6 hours a day during last summer but now my parents are forcing me out and I'm working full time to support myself. Because of this, I can only find the energy to do about 2-3 hours of programming a day.\n\nMy plan was to continue working and programming for about 2-3 hours per day (which would give me a max of 711 more programming hours by the end of the year assuming the unlikely that I'll both never miss a day and always do 3 hours instead of 2). Then, by either January 2022 or August 2022, I'm focusing ENTIRELY on programming. I will take a work break offer from my job for about 3 or 4 months. \n\nMy question is this: \n\nShould I use that work break to just focus on self-study and finally getting around to building projects? Or should I use that time to go to code bootcamp? Or should I say forget the work break and just go to bootcamp part-time and do code part time?\n\nMy fear is that without a bootcamp education and without a CS degree, I will never be able to compete with those who went to bootcamp and definitely not with those with a CS degree. But I also fear that by going to bootcamp, I could potentially be just wasting $20,000 on stuff that it is possible to learn on my own.

    "body":"So this last semester I just finished an Enterprise Java and Frameworks class, we learned useful things like threading, JDBC\/ODBC, SQLJ, Spring, JUnit, Version Control software, stuff like that. But it seems basic. This is first time I really feel like the skills I used could be applicable.\n\nBut this stuff in class was pretty basic, download a Glassfish server, deploy JSF\/JSP on a local host, download an SQL server, use JDBC and Glassfish to use a SQL backend with a localhost application server. Is this what a back-end aspect of full stack developers do?\n\nI thought the IT would maintain the actual server, or it gets into devops. I see a lot of jobs wanting container deployment so I might study that over the summer. I haven't taken Network Protocols, Intro to Telecom, or Design of Database Systems yet, or Operating Systems.\n\nSo maybe I should self study those? What does a full stack development job really entail as far as network protocols and telecom and all that stuff. We learned about bean factories in Spring, thread pools and connection pools, is it more about managing these and getting more in depth with threading for enterprise applications? I can study more about the architectures of the technologies, and frameworks, etc.",

    "body":"Hello.\n\nI know this probably gets asked a lot, but I need some advice on my career progression.\n\nThe thing is, I have been working as a database engineer for almost 2 years but most of the work is not very challenging. It is very repetitive and you don't require much cs knowledge to do it. As a result, I did not manage to gain any actual experience as I was doing the same thing day in and day out.\n\nIn these 2 years, for almost 1 year I was free. I did not had any work to do and no calls to attend. So i started doing leetcode. Its been around 5 months of leetcode now and I think Iam OK at it now.\n\n I know how to solve problems and I want to shift companies. The problem now is, I don't have any Skill or actual work experience to share with my future employer. All I know is how to leetcode and some basic select queries and creating stored procedures in database.\n\nI have been applying to many companies in this pandemic but none have reached out to me. I think the culprit is my lack lustre resume as I have nothing to to showcase as my actual work.\n\nIts just 2 years of bogus experience.\n\nSo what do I do? I can't apply for a Backend engineer role since I haven't worked on it. I can apply for database roles but i only know the basics. \n\nShall i start leetcoding sql queries?\n\n\nIs there any role where I can utilise my leetcode skills and basic db skills to get a good job? \n\nWhat should be my next step in order for me to get selected in any other company with a decent hike? \n\nIam at my wits end.\n\n**TLDR:**\n Worked for 2 years. Most of the time, was free. Hence no actual work experience. Did leetcode practise in free time. Now i dont get any interview calls because I couldn't showcase my work in my resume and I have basic skills only.\n\nWhat should be my next step in order for me to get selected in any other company with a decent hike?",

    "title":"Need help in finding out the next steps of my career",
    "body":"Hi all, I'm in really need for advice, so I hope it's OK to post this here.\n\nI'm a back-end developer with 7 years in exp. I worked in several companies, mostly doing APIs and dealing with dbs. I have a bachelors in Software Engineering + business, so it's like a weird combination and it lacks some areas of a \"traditional\" CS degree. I have also experience with working with front-end, although my skills are not at the same level of back-end, but I can pretty much find my ways of doing stuff in Typescript\/Angular. I also deal with \"Ops\" stuff, like CI builds, Docker\/K8s\/Helm, but again, not an expert. I can prepare images and all the like but I'm not a infrastructure\/network\/security expert.\n\nAnyway I'm currently in a job which the tech stack is modern and it's the only reason why I wake up everyday and go to work. The team is awful. Management is awful. It's this culture of blaming when things go wrong, no support and I'd even go and say a bit of 'tech bros' culture. Another thing that is bothering me is I get these huge tasks, not even a high level specification, just a \"wish\" of what they want. I try to make meetings, to find out what is it that they want, most of the time the meeting gets hijacked by one of them (the tech bros) arguing about something that we'll not need in 10 years. Then  I have to work my ass off to do things, then when I present my ideas or what I came up with they say oh but that's not it, or let's change this.. so the task that should be 2 weeks becomes months, just bcs I have no way to know what they want. Make no mistake, I don't work 2 weeks without talking about it, I post on our chats, i create documentation, diagram. But nobody seem to care and they only care later on. Frustrates the hell out of me.\n\nSo this has been going for over 2 years now. Recently I decided to start looking around for jobs and I found out this one which looks very interesting but it's completely out of my comfort zone. The tech stack is different from the ones I work with, and not only that, it's a different domain, I'll be developing let's say tools for other devs.  I already had an interview with them and will be having a second one, so I guess they liked me. It was very technical, about the tech stack I work now, and there was some other general questions. I liked the interviewer, it was fair and felt more like a good conversation.\n\nSo, now I'm wondering what should I do. I'm kinda getting scared of jumping and then finding out it was too much to handle. I stalked some ppl there and they all seem super smart and working with like 3, 4 different languages, doing all sort of different things and I'm here like: Why they are even considering me? I only know 1 language \"well\" + front-end but not that deep.\n\nI kinda understand that if they decide to offer me the job, it's because they believe in my skills and my past track tells that given challenges and new things I have always overcome them. I'm excited about it and I think it will be great for me as a professional to broaden my skills but the imposter in me is telling me that this is TO much and I'm panicking a bit :).\n\nSo I guess what I'm after with this post is: What you think about moving to a job where you don't have much exp with the tech stack? What things could I ask during the interview to assess if they are really aware of the fact that I lack knowledge and also if I will be given the time\/support to ramp up and become a productive member of the team? I'm aware of my fears and the shitty imposter syndrome holding me, but I'm afraid of jumping in, then been given tasks where I have no idea what to do and then not get support, specially now with Covid and prob not meeting the team IRL for some months. In the other hand it's not like it's raining cool jobs, so I'm also worried of moving then being fired or not liking it, and have lost what I have today. I have my savings and would be ok without a job for months but I would prefer not to be in that situation.\n\nSorry for the long post and thanks in advance :)",

My dad makes six dollars less than me with fifteen years of experience (we live in NYC so that is really not enough to live off alone haha). So I dunno man. T_T \n\nGranted, I worked extremely hard to make it to this position too. This will be my fourth technical internship on top of other extracurriculars and hardships I faced (my grandfather died from COVID. also, poor grades lol), so I'm very happy, but do feel a twinge of \"something.\"\n\nI think I just want to give back to my family honestly. They're not bad people (well, my mom treats my dad as a ranting bag thoe). Only thing is that my dad is extremely tired and overworked for what he's paid, and both my parents don't clean up after themselves. Security guard work isn't necessarily hard but during the pandemic, my dad would say things like, \"If we die, we die,\" which implies that he doesn't think much of his life. Not sure what to really think or if I can even help him change that.\n\nPoint is, coming from a low income family to having pretty decent wages is like, mind blowing. I have such a hard time spending money because I'm used to not having much haha.\n\nEdit: The question is poorly written. I meant to ask if any other CS interns are making more money than their parents OR are advancing a lot from previously being low income - and are feeling weird about it.",

I don\u2019t expect to be making 100k right off the bat, but I don\u2019t want to be making so little I can barely get by but I think that\u2019s everyone\u2019s way of thinking. \n\nSo the main point of my post is:\n\nIs it still possible to have job opportunities up in NYC?

    "body":"I have a question about executive roles in big tech companies.\n\nAs long as I have worked for them and followed them they always seem like they lack creative juices.\n\nThese execs are always in such a position of privilege and rarely do they ever seem to improve the products they govern. I'm not arguing that engineers would be better at coming up with product ideas and the general direction, but I do think that some people are naturally good at ideas and strategies.\n\nWhich is weird because these types of personalities are generally the engineers at a company. And the execs tend to be more like salesmen or managers grandfathered into their high status role.\n\nIdeas people should be execs. Not managerial people. These are two very different types of people. One type is good at managing others, details, facts, schedules. The other is good at big picture, creative, potentially a bit disorganized, and abstract thinkers.\n\nYet every exec I talked to so far is just a glorified manager. And their ideas are (no offense) usually pretty bad. I've seen great products get shafted by terrible ideas piled on top of it by people who have no understanding of what a good idea or bad idea looks like. And you can see this in almost every big tech company.\n\nWant a great example? Activision Blizzard. It's clear the higher ups are not interested in making good games or they don't understand game systems. They are so out of touch with the product that it just seems like the perfect example of this. It happens on a smaller scale at every tech company. And it makes me wonder why these people even need to exist. These execs remind me of DeeDee from Dexter's lab. They just run in and start pressing buttons and turning jobs and making noise hoping that they do something good and can take all the credit for it.",

    "title":"Failing to find work-life balance yet another time - what am I doing wrong?",
    "body":"So I'm just at the start of my journey, a few years out of college, but I'm finding myself failing to find any resemblence of a work-life balance at yet another job. I've worked as a programmer thrice so far and every single time, I'm facing the same problem - I cannot wrap my head around how to structure my days to still have a life. I've tried going corporate, I've tried smaller companies but the overarching problem remains the same.\n\nIn order to get to office at 9AM-ish, I wake up around 7:40 as my commute takes up around 40 mins in the morning and anything in the realm of 40min-70min in the evening depending on the traffic and accidents on the way back. So after I get out at 5PM, I'm home around 6PM, eat dinner and start my life around 6:40PM or so. In order to be able to live the next day, I have to go to bed around midnight, having prepared myself and sandwiches for breakfast and for work beforehand. \n\nThis realistically leaves me with 4 hours between 7PM and 11PM which does not sound _that terrible_ on paper but in reality, after work I'm so exhausted that these hours couldn't be further from any \"quality\" me-time. I feel like my brain is fried - both from having to _pretend_ to work for a large part of the past 8 hours (which I'm sure many people working corporate can relate to - though now working at a smaller company, I feel like the problem remains largely the same), and from the lack of fresh air and\/or human interaction during that time (I'm an outgoing person and I crave human interactions but at my previous jobs, the interaction was literally three sentences exchanged at the watercooler a day; now at this new job, it's the same thing - the guys I'm seated with in the room literally don't say _a word_ apart from \"Hi\" and \"Bye\" the whole 8 hours - and believe me I've tried to have them talking but having felt like I was conducting an interview again and again, I just stopped pushing). Also, I'm so appalled by any digital media after sitting 8hrs in front of a screen that the things I would normally do to unwind (watch YouTube, watch a movie, play games) are completely off the table as my eyes are dead and I can't even focus on those things. I feel both physically and mentally done and it takes me a good two hours to be able to do any focused, quality activity for the remaining two. \n\nIn my previous jobs, this escalated so much that I'd gained like 15kgs over my year of working there, neglected basically all my hobbies and hated every hour of my life both on the week days (because of having no quality time outside of work) and on the weekends (because I wanted to cram so many things that I wasn't able to do during the week over those 48hrs that I was constantly stressed and frustrated that I could not). I did learn some lessons from that job and applied them now (like preparing meals in advance, forcing myself to sleep right etc) but honestly, the effect of those seems pretty negligible in the big picture.\n\nSo now I feel like I'm starting to fall into the same cycle again and I don't want to allow it to spiral as much as the last time. How do people still have a life while working full time? Having hobbies, friends and relationships, running freaking marathons? I do have all those things but am never able to sustain them when working full time. Even now I can see that my running schedule starts to fall apart again, I'm playing instruments 1 day a week instead of the usual 6 and so on. Despite rigorously sleeping 7h+ nights now, still the thing I'd love to do the most is just go and have a nap (which I'm forcing myself not to as it disregulates night sleep afterwards when done that late in the day). Is it the nature of working in CS and if you're not temperamentally compatible with being silent and alone for 95% of the day then you're not going to fit in? What am I doing wrong? Do you have any tips, personal accounts?",

I feel like that might not be enough especially since applying for software engineering internships has been rough to say the least. \n\nShould I consider applying for a masters in csc or data science? Im not too keen on working in the data science field due to many subreddits stating that many data science jobs today are not at all like the cool stuff you learn in school, also that many of these \"data science\" jobs are really more like data analytics and things of that sort.

Can ML engineer be a similar work environment\/field as a software engineer (assuming you work at similar tech companies). Idk much all I know is that I feel more challenged and more satisfied when I work on my csc projects.

I just finished my freshman year in computer engineering so both roles would help out a lot, one on the software side, the other on the hardware side of things.\n\nShould I ask the software company to delay my start to see if the other company would hire me? Or should I just apologize to the other company and stick with the software role for this summer?",

    "body":"Hi everybody!\n\nMy 26yr old S.O has a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from a school in Thailand and she has been having great trouble finding a full-time job in the USA since she moved here to live with me (\\~2 years ago). The best she could find was an unpaid internship as a web developer at a crypto startup, but she isn't happy with that job since it doesn't pay anything, so she currently works part time as a licensed massage therapist. I am also in fact a computer engineer, currently working as a video game programmer at a indie gaming company.\n\nMy S.O applies to about 10 jobs a week and has applied for over 300 places now, I think. She has gotten like 3 interviews in 2 years of searching. I have worked with her to revise her resume at least 4 times to no avail. She has setup accounts all over Monster, Indeed, Angelist, etc.\n\nPossible reasons why she has trouble finding interviews\n\n1. Resume is probably not written well.\n2. Her college is unknown to pretty much everybody in the U.S.\n3. She doesn't have any full time work experience in the U.S. as a programmer at a well known company.\n4. She is here on a long-term green card (she sometimes puts this on her resume).\n5. COVID impacting hiring.\n\nIs there anything she can do to improve her odds of finding a full-time web development job in the U.S?\n\nMy only advice:\n\n1. Get her resume professionally written.\n2. Get a masters in computer science from a well known U.S. university.\n\nI would love to hear experiences from other immigrants who might be in her shoes and if\/how they have overcome it.\n\nThank you.",

    "title":"Are my expectations as a future software engineer too much?",
    "body":"Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently a first year college student attending a pretty good Jesuit University in the north east of the US and I'm majoring in Computer Science. I intend on doing an accelerated program where I get my bachelors degree in computer science and masters degree in software engineering within 5 years. My bachelors tuition is practically completely covered with a full tuition scholarship, I am a commuter so I do not pay room and board, and my masters will hopefully be covered with a graduate assistantship of some sort. Therefore, I will likely be debt free by the end of my education.\n\nThat puts me in a great position of not being in any debt out of college with a bachelors and masters, as I also have fully financed a car that will hopefully last me the next 8-10 years. Therefore, the next step would be to move out of my parents' home and find somewhere to live. For years, my dream has actually been to live \"up in the sky\" in a highrise in a beautiful city, and many of the top tech cities in the country are ludicrously expensive to the point that software engineers may not be able to afford to live in them. Something that has been heavily weighing on my mind is the fact that I ultimately hope to move to Miami, Florida, in a high-rise condo (not apartment) ranging from $2000-$3000 per month, but from my research, it appears as if Miami is not a big tech city and the engineers\/developers do not get paid as much as engineers in, say, the west coast. I'm at a loss because living in the west coast in a highrise in a city is nearly double or triple the cost of doing the same on the east coast, but the salaries are much higher over there. I'm unsure if this dream is unrealistic in my 20's, but I want to do anything I can to set myself up to make it happen. I've lived in a crammed house my entire life, and the idea of living in a cozy condo with beautiful views is peaceful to me. Additionally, I am in a relatively long-term relationship, and my girlfriend is on-board with the plan and going to school for registered nursing, however I am unsure if it would be wise to finance the condo together rather than pay for it myself. Any advice would be appreciated on anything!",

    "body":"I'm a Senior Software Engineer (just got the promotion) at a startup (2 years 8 months exp). We're a development team (6 members and expanding now) in Asia working on a Swedish project. I joined the company on August last year.  \nMy salary was ok but I got an offer from another company and I let know my CEO. Then he offered me more (almost twice as which I was getting at the company) and promoted me to Senior. Even before that both CEO and Team-Lead have mentioned to me that I'm exceeding their expectations and they're very happy about my performance. But I thought it was just something to keep me happy and keep tied to the company without any pay raise. But apparently, it wasn't.  \nAfter the promotion Team Lead contacted me and mentioned that I'm performing well and I can be his right-hand man hereafter and said that he'll assign some advanced stuff to me which he was working on but now he doesn't have much time to work on since the team is expanding. I was surprised since there's already another Senior (at least 2 years more exp than me) who has joined the company way before I joined. But anyway I felt so good he choose me over other seniors.   \nWhat worries me is the company is very flexible. We just have to complete 40 hours per week and for more hours we're getting OT. But now considering the pay (which is now way above the market) I don't need to work OT. But I'm not sure how to proceed with the new responsibilities. Any advice, tips would be greatly appreciated.  \n\n\n  \n**TLDR** : *Promoted to Senior Software Engineer and chosen as the right-hand man of the Team Lead, over 2 devs who joined the company way before me and have more experience. How can I impress the boss and do good for the promotion?*",

    "body":"Hi all,\n\nSo I am in a strange situation. I got accepted to go to PT school about a month ago and was supposed to start in the fall of this year. However, my national guard unit got surprised with a deployment that's going to be from Oct 2021 to around September of 2022. This means I won't be able to start PT school until Jan of 2023.  I will be honest and say it does have me down in the dumps since I applied specifically after being told this deployment wouldn't happen but now it is. \n\nNow since I will be spending a year in Kuwait doing basically nothing (and will have internet access most likely) I have been looking at what I can do to not make that year a waste of time. Looking at CS vs PT I noticed how much more upward mobility and flexibility there is in the CS career field compared to PT. Also not to mention not having to go to PT school for 3 years which means no income at all and maybe some debt even with the military paying for schooling. \n\nI have always liked computers and have built many systems, but I have zero experience with code. If I applied myself over the course of a year would I be able to become proficient enough in the an area of CS to possibly switch career fields and work my way up from an entry level position in the future? If so what path should I take to go from learning to applying what I learned to looking for a job? And of course is it even a good idea to think about changing careers when I have an acceptance letter in hand to PT?\n\nAny input is appreciated. Thanks everyone",
