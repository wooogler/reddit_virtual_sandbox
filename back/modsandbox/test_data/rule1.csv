97,n6lagt,cis-hetro_tyrant,Career hopping,"Hello Everyone!

Ok, I'll cut to the chase here, I'm a senior year fashion design student starting to get curious about software engineering. 

My primary reasons for career hopping, 

1. I like money.

2. Fashion isn't exciting and there's no room for meaningful innovation. Besides which consumers are simply not interested in fashion, like yeah sure everyone wants a Louis Vuitton or whatever but there's no value for craftsmanship or design, only 'hype'. The pandemic has forced the industry into an existential crisis and it seems like a sinking ship to me.

3. I want to be part of a meaningful community that doesn't have its head up it's a\*\*, tech/coding/UX/UI seems like a nice bunch of people... but I don't know that yet.

5. I don't want to live in NY/Cali.

I know people keep saying it's a trendy field and everyone is career-hopping into it but nonetheless, I have a few questions:


1. Is it worth it? Will it stay relevant? Is the money good? Is the work culture good (or at least not as toxic as fashion)?

2. Do I need another degree? I would rather not get another degree or Bootcamp. I'd rather be self-taught or a certificate. Is that a legitimate route to go or will I be wasting my time?

3. Are there any transferable skills between Fashion Design and software? I can make tech packs and spec sheets, 3D model a dress, draft patterns and textile prints, cut and sew a garment and photograph to sell.. but how do these skills transfer to something like software development? 

4. What does it take to get a well-paying job?

148,n68d4q,futuredoc70,Thinking about switching from medicine. Am I insane?,"I'm a resident physician.  I graduated med school last year and will be finishing my first year of residency this summer.

I don't love medicine and the specialty I chose is not going to set me up with a ton of opportunities.  The job market outlook right now is - ""if you're open to moving almost anywhere in the country you'll find a job.  If not, do a 2nd or 3rd fellowship"".  Chances are I'll also be restricted to academia and its salaries.  I'll be making ~60k for the next 3 years and will probably be looking at 150k-200k in 4-5 years, then low 200s several years after that.   Certainly not something to scoff at, but also not the ""doctor money"" some people expect.  Medicine also comes with insurance that will cut into my salary.

I have become increasingly interested in technology and computer programming over the past 5 years.  So much so that I'm considering leaving to become a software engineer.

Would this be absolutely insane?  It wouldn't take much to beat my work satisfaction right now and I already sit in front of a computer all day.

I think my main concerns about making the switch are my ability to make a salary in the same ballpark while having similar benefits (4-6 weeks paid vacation, health insurance) and not being too late to the game to be able to succeed and move up the career ladder.  I'm in my early 30s.

Concerns about staying in medicine are my relative lack of opportunities, the need to move several times in the next several years, and the fact that I just don't like it all that much anymore.   Switching specialities could fix some of this but I think I'd like software engineering more than I'd like any other specialty.

Getting some great insight through this Reddit group, is anyone else in a similar situation or know of anyone in this situation?
I graduated from a 5 year integrated Masters in Electronic and Computer Engineering, which was at times a pretty gruelling experience. 

I never really enjoyed the circuit side of things and always leaned towards software, so got a job in a big American Bank in software engineering in Dublin, Ireland and the work is just plain really boring.

Im applying to lots of jobs in non-descript software engineering roles in smaller companies (1000 people) and am getting through the initial screenings and 1/2 tech interviews. but when the tech interviews get hard and very technical I just can't seem to impress the interviewers.
It's like my CV looks really good because I've done a lot of interesting projects in college (including a pretty cool thesis) and have a year or so experience. But my actual skills aren't as honed as they could be. I feel like I'm nearly being punished for studying engineering instead of computer science, we never studied data structures and algorithms so I feel automatically behind other interviewees.

Has anyone found themselves in a situation like this? And how did they find an area they enjoy and are good at?

Any advice would be soo greatly appreciated,

This is my fist post ever on Reddit. I got here through r/learnprogramming (and their FAQ)

 I introduce myself shortly: I'm a 31 yr old guy with a brand new sound engineering BA and some experience in this field. Previously I also worked in other fields (IT/telecommunication), and I graduated (way back in 2008) in a computer science high school, where I learned mainly C++, Java and SQL (basics stuff)

Some friends and acquaintances of mine often suggest me to ""merge"" this two worlds, but I'm struggling to understand a way to do this. Not the best way ever, but a wise way. 

Some friends suggest me to mantain my audio skills and ""lend"" this skills for collaboration projects in the coding field. Others suggest to brush up my C++ skills and to work in the DSP and Plugin developing field (JUCE)

Still others suggest me to look at PureData, SuperCollider, MaxMSP, etc.

Having no experience in these areas, however, I admit that I feel a bit confused, and with this post I would like to get out of my mind a little and compare myself with you.  

I hope I have respected the subreddit rules, I swear I did my best

Cons: Expensive, lengthy, no guarantee of job quickly, I will have to put up with my current job for about another year.
2. Unpaid Internship- Pros: Networking, experience with interviews, work experience to put on a resume, real experience with programming within an organization, access to higher level devs for questions, I could possibly graduate to a paid position? Cons: Unpaid, no guarantee of graduating to paid position, experience on resume still may not be enough for future job hunt.

196,n5w1vv,GabenIsLife,Looking to make a career change; hoping to get some input,"For some background, I've been working around 5 years in corporate healthcare IT (very much customer facing; not really any coding/programming experience required at all). I've been feeling very much like I needed to go elsewhere for a while but I haven't had a good push as the job pays OK and offers great benefits (but with 0 upward mobility).

However, last week I had a medical incident and at this point I'm not sure if I'll be able to safely drive as much (if at all), even going up and down stairs can be a challenge. I'm on medical leave from work while waiting on specialists and referrals etc. but I'm coming from an IT job that involved a large amount of walking. And work from home would be challenging as we already have a help desk that handles most remote issues (management already decided to not let people WFH as there was fear of just downsizing and outsourcing everyone).

I realized that it'd be much better for me in the long term to switch to a career that allows more work from home/flexibility and could hopefully offer much better pay - right now with my current job I don't see myself having a long term career/retirement plan, and until I hear from my doctors I'm stuck on medical leave wondering if I'll even be able to go back to my job.

I've been looking into coding bootcamps (as I'd rather not spend 4 years in school racking up tons of debt), but a lot seem really sketchy. The one I see most advertised/recommended is App Authority, but there's literally no way to schedule a talk with admissions (which seems really suspicious). They claim you pay nothing upfront until you ""find a job"" making $50k+, but they don't specify that it's a software engineer job. My current job I make a little over $50k, so it would be nice to avoid paying large sums while at a job I may or may not be able to go back to at all.

I should note that I have very minimal experience with Matlab and Python from my geology coursework using ArcGIS and other geospatial softwares.

Since I already have a BS and 30k of student loan debt, I figured I should find some free online resources to try and learn coding/software development. Does anyone have any recommendations?

Are there any coding/software certifications I could get outside of getting an actual computer science degree? My hope is that if I were to pursue this, a recruiter would see that although I have a degree in an unrelated field, if I could get certified in python, Matlab, or anything else I might need, it could give me a chance of making a career switch to computer science. It just seems like a waste to incur even more debt if I don’t have to when I already have a BS. Does this matter?

Any and all advice on where to get started would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR I have a BS in geology, looking to switch to computer science, need advice on free  resources to start learning the basics",1620223382,t3_n5gngv,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n5gngv/carter_switch_from_geologyengineering_to_cs/,5073,748,0,1533677015,1,0,GeoTech84

311,n4yr2c,itsnbdtoday,Advice on career switch from PM to Software Engineering,"Hi all, thanks for reading and helping me out. I've been at Microsoft  for 2.5 years as a PM for a couple teams. I've been working here since graduation and have an EE degree with a minor in CS. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to code or do many 'technical' projects while on these teams and don't have any internship experience, so I'm considering myself as having 'zero-experience' although that's not completely true. I would like to switch roles to software engineering as I think this position better aligns with my interests and provides an opportunity to gain more useful and tangible skills. I have a couple questions I hope folks could help me with:

1. [I saw this older post from the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6e0dm4/are_remote_entry_level_positions_rare/) about finding entry level remote positions, and how rare it is. Now that we've been working from home for the last year I imagine (or hope) that there would be more opportunities for entry level remote work? If that's the case, any advice on where to look? If not remote, what would be the best listings to find entry-level positions?
2. It will be easiest for me to pivot internally but am interested in exploring other companies. I'm not sure if being at Microsoft is a better help considering my role but, is there anything you think I could do to better my chances of switching companies (beyond ""doing side projects"")?
3. I'm currently going through CTCI and attempting a couple LeetCode problems a day (studying Java). My coding experience is limited to Java and C which I studied in school. I know that lots of companies use more modern languages such as React, TypeScript, etc. Is it necessary for me to learn these to standout as 'relevant' (such as taking a bootcamp course, or doing a side project in these languages)?  I know ""anything helps"" but 'm trying to optimize my studying since I have a full-time job.

I may need some help deciding on whether to pivot companies or try to move internally (and then pivot) but would like to start here.

I’ve been self teaching myself and trying to dive into the theory on my own as well. My other option is college (US community college is called college in Canada.) for 2-3 years with a coop.

To put it simply this is the amount of money and time I would be spending for each option:


**University to get bachelors of CS:**

my situations a little special in regards to transfer credits, so it would take me 3-4 years and $10,000 per year (without textbooks). Potential Coop.
I will have two degrees after this option.


**College to get diploma in Programming**

It would take me 3 years and will cost me $4400 (without textbooks) per year. Potential Coop. 
I will have a degree and diploma after this option.


Or my next option would be to not do any further schooling, continue self teaching and start working in about a year. What do you guys advise?

407,n424qs,ov3rsight,DS or SWE for entry level job?,"Hi all. A little background about me... I graduated from a MS in Math last May. I have extensive coursework in math/stats/CS/ML, did a computation-heavy thesis (simulations in Python, not ML) which led to a publication as first author, and taught undergrad calculus. My university was a no-name state university in a rural area with few connections to tech and I don't have much of a network. I have no industry experience/internships -- I intended to do a PhD but realized it wasn't for me.

Due to health issues I've been taking time off after graduating. I've sharpened my technical skills and completed a few projects in the last few months and have started applying for jobs. I think my background and interests are most suited to a DS role; however, these roles seem to be highly contested by PhDs and people with several YoE. My math background should put me ahead of many candidates (e.g. non-quantitative BS + MSDS), but I feel my lack of a PhD or previous experience prevents me from being a strong candidate. Also, because of how poorly-defined DS roles are, I get the sense a lot of companies don't know what they're looking for, and the interviews can test you on anything.

I've heard that starting as a analyst or SWE is a better route into DS/ML. I'm not really interested in the dashboarding and SQL duties that an analyst role entails. I've learned some web dev skills (Django, JS/React, etc.) to deploy ML models and think a SWE (web dev) role could be fitting. I'd have to practice LC like hell, though.

**Given my background should I apply to DS or SWE positions to optimize my chance of landing a job?** I'm more aligned with DS, but it is insanely competitive at entry level, and my callback rate has been low. Alternatively, I have *some* SWE skills and the barrier to entry is lower.",1620063350,t3_n424qs,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n424qs/ds_or_swe_for_entry_level_job/,297,729,1,1480573490,1,0,ov3rsight

I first started at a university in 2012 but pretty much failed out because my priorities were terrible. Since then I’ve at 2 different banks. One as a teller and another in the call center and some landscaping work. I just want something more for myself and I don’t want my age to be a factor as to yeah I should have this and that figured out, etc. 

I started school at my local community college in the fall of 2019, I finished up my last 2 gen Ed’s, college algebra and csc 111. The following spring I took precalc 1 and csc 112 and ended up failing those classes because the pandemic started and zoom classes just wasn’t doing it for me (yes I know that’s a bad excuse and I should of passed). So fast forward to now, I will be taking precalc 1 & 2 this summer.

My goal is to take all the lower level CS classes at my community college and transfer them back to the university I first attended. At that point I will have to finish my upper level courses, electives and another math class (calc 2 I think it is).

At my community college, I have 7 classes left to take:
Computer science 2
Database management systems 
Data structures and algorithms 
Discrete mathematics 
Calc 1  
Precalc 1 & 2

All the classes above except precalc 1 & 2 are transferable to university.

Okay so I guess that’s a lot of background info...but my question is it worth going back to school at this age? I would like to be a software engineer. A lot of ppl have counted me out unfortunately. I want to prove them wrong as well as prove to myself I can do this. Also Idk if information science & technology could be an option as well because the CS math courses are kinda scary and I’m not a math wiz or anything.

I was considering joining a boot camp but decided on taking a couple of Udemy courses prior to committing to something so expensive.

Judging by the course contents, is the web development course enough to get an entry level job? It has some projects included in the course and I was also thinking of making a couple of personal projects afterwards as well to help if necessary. If that’s not enough, what should I look at for next steps? 

I’m also wondering what field in software development I might fit best in - I really enjoyed the problem solving aspect in the course I took (it was mainly implementing data structures and algorithms from scratch), but I’m sure that’s not what jobs are actually like.

I'm decent at leetcode and it kinda come to me easier because of my math background. But the caveat of this switch is maintaining a salary that helps out my fam for atleast now (willing to relocate anywhere I just help them financially). Wondering if it's doable and if so if you guys have advice.

**Long Form Explanation Below:**

1. I work at a semiconductor foundry as a materials engineer. I'm the guy trynna make sure the supply meets demand however, I want to switch over to CS because I don't like the location and I am decent at coding.
2. With my background I didn't know which direction to go through so I went on free code camp and just went the web dev route. Thought why not.
3. I want to leverage my previous technical experience so I was wondering if you all wanted to help me find my place in the Computer Science world. I already know python due to using for research before. However, the data science route seemed to be the most stringent on degrees and certifications. That's why I started to pick up web dev. Seemed the most fluid and I can knock out javascript and a couple projects by the end of the year.
4. My only caveat with not leverging my current resume is that I do have a salary requirement. I am right now helping my family out and paying for their bills along with mine for now since they got screwed by the pandemic. It won't be for long but I would need to maintain my salary of 89k atleast to do so. Is that doable if I switch? I can leetcode very very well. I am learning the whole algorithms and data structures aspect but, my math background kinda helps out a lot (I dual majored in math in college).
