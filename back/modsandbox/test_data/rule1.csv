148,n68d4q,futuredoc70,Thinking about switching from medicine. Am I insane?,"I'm a resident physician.  I graduated med school last year and will be finishing my first year of residency this summer.

I don't love medicine and the specialty I chose is not going to set me up with a ton of opportunities.  The job market outlook right now is - ""if you're open to moving almost anywhere in the country you'll find a job.  If not, do a 2nd or 3rd fellowship"".  Chances are I'll also be restricted to academia and its salaries.  I'll be making ~60k for the next 3 years and will probably be looking at 150k-200k in 4-5 years, then low 200s several years after that.   Certainly not something to scoff at, but also not the ""doctor money"" some people expect.  Medicine also comes with insurance that will cut into my salary.

I have become increasingly interested in technology and computer programming over the past 5 years.  So much so that I'm considering leaving to become a software engineer.

Would this be absolutely insane?  It wouldn't take much to beat my work satisfaction right now and I already sit in front of a computer all day.

I think my main concerns about making the switch are my ability to make a salary in the same ballpark while having similar benefits (4-6 weeks paid vacation, health insurance) and not being too late to the game to be able to succeed and move up the career ladder.  I'm in my early 30s.

Concerns about staying in medicine are my relative lack of opportunities, the need to move several times in the next several years, and the fact that I just don't like it all that much anymore.   Switching specialities could fix some of this but I think I'd like software engineering more than I'd like any other specialty.

Thanks!",1620310830,t3_n68d4q,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n68d4q/thinking_about_switching_from_medicine_am_i_insane/,374,3986,5,1436553139,1,0,futuredoc70

183,n5yp3k,Ironic_Gangster,Self-Taught Dev Getting Desperate..,"Howdy there partners, I'm a self-taught dev. I have no degree, and I've only worked in retail. I have a few projects in my portfolio, but if I'm going to be completely honest I feel as though my skill level is very much internship level. Nevertheless, I hate my job and the CS job hunt for internships has been  rough. I'm getting desperate as I want to quit my job and get into the field soon. So I have put together a few options and I would like to get some opinions as to which course of action I should take:

1. Programming Bootcamp (will have to be remote due to my location)- Pros: Networking, certification, refine my skills, access to teachers for questions, they will likely improve my chances of getting hired at a high paying job. Cons: Expensive, lengthy, no guarantee of job quickly, I will have to put up with my current job for about another year.
2. Unpaid Internship- Pros: Networking, experience with interviews, work experience to put on a resume, real experience with programming within an organization, access to higher level devs for questions, I could possibly graduate to a paid position? Cons: Unpaid, no guarantee of graduating to paid position, experience on resume still may not be enough for future job hunt.

196,n5w1vv,GabenIsLife,Looking to make a career change; hoping to get some input,"For some background, I've been working around 5 years in corporate healthcare IT (very much customer facing; not really any coding/programming experience required at all). I've been feeling very much like I needed to go elsewhere for a while but I haven't had a good push as the job pays OK and offers great benefits (but with 0 upward mobility).

However, last week I had a medical incident and at this point I'm not sure if I'll be able to safely drive as much (if at all), even going up and down stairs can be a challenge. I'm on medical leave from work while waiting on specialists and referrals etc. but I'm coming from an IT job that involved a large amount of walking. And work from home would be challenging as we already have a help desk that handles most remote issues (management already decided to not let people WFH as there was fear of just downsizing and outsourcing everyone).

I realized that it'd be much better for me in the long term to switch to a career that allows more work from home/flexibility and could hopefully offer much better pay - right now with my current job I don't see myself having a long term career/retirement plan, and until I hear from my doctors I'm stuck on medical leave wondering if I'll even be able to go back to my job.

I've been looking into coding bootcamps (as I'd rather not spend 4 years in school racking up tons of debt), but a lot seem really sketchy. The one I see most advertised/recommended is App Authority, but there's literally no way to schedule a talk with admissions (which seems really suspicious). They claim you pay nothing upfront until you ""find a job"" making $50k+, but they don't specify that it's a software engineer job. My current job I make a little over $50k, so it would be nice to avoid paying large sums while at a job I may or may not be able to go back to at all.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** I'm in my late 30s, may or may not be disabled/unable to walk/drive reliably, and want to break into software engineering/half-stack/full-stack. Where the heck do I start?

I am starting a CS program this fall and have no programming knowledge. I was initially interested in game dev but I know that its not the best field to go into if you want to have good pay and a comfortable work/life balance. Anyway, I bought rob miles yellow book and have been slowly going through it, then I plan to take a Udemy course on developing 2d games.

Or is there a better way for me to start right now? Just feeling completely lost and would appreciate any advice. I am in Canada btw. 

I guess since I have wasted so much time already I am afraid of choosing the wrong path and wasting even more time. What's the fastest path to a job in 1 year time that I can learn while in my first year, and in turn is that path going to help me earn 6 figures eventually down the road?

I first started at a university in 2012 but pretty much failed out because my priorities were terrible. Since then I’ve at 2 different banks. One as a teller and another in the call center and some landscaping work. I just want something more for myself and I don’t want my age to be a factor as to yeah I should have this and that figured out, etc. 

I started school at my local community college in the fall of 2019, I finished up my last 2 gen Ed’s, college algebra and csc 111. The following spring I took precalc 1 and csc 112 and ended up failing those classes because the pandemic started and zoom classes just wasn’t doing it for me (yes I know that’s a bad excuse and I should of passed). So fast forward to now, I will be taking precalc 1 & 2 this summer.

My goal is to take all the lower level CS classes at my community college and transfer them back to the university I first attended. At that point I will have to finish my upper level courses, electives and another math class (calc 2 I think it is).

At my community college, I have 7 classes left to take:
Computer science 2
Database management systems 
Data structures and algorithms 
Discrete mathematics 
Calc 1  
Precalc 1 & 2

All the classes above except precalc 1 & 2 are transferable to university.

Okay so I guess that’s a lot of background info...but my question is it worth going back to school at this age? I would like to be a software engineer. A lot of ppl have counted me out unfortunately. I want to prove them wrong as well as prove to myself I can do this. Also Idk if information science & technology could be an option as well because the CS math courses are kinda scary and I’m not a math wiz or anything.

I now have a keen interest in programming and want to go into software as a career. I think I have a knack for it and really enjoy it. 

I was considering joining a boot camp but decided on taking a couple of Udemy courses prior to committing to something so expensive. 
I’m currently taking this Udemy course on [Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-fullstack-web-development-bootcamp/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=Webindex_Catchall_la.EN_cc.CA&utm_term=_._ag_119831896715_._ad_504641403594_._kw__._de_m_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-423967289464_._li_1002287_._pd__._&matchtype=b&gclid=CjwKCAjwm7mEBhBsEiwA_of-TK2vG3HRPOHcjO879FBTiIGmr7y0IoJw6xgtyS60xJ3JfE2Hye_z3hoCUHQQAvD_BwE) and was going to later take a course in Data Science to gauge what I have a preference for.

Judging by the course contents, is the web development course enough to get an entry level job? It has some projects included in the course and I was also thinking of making a couple of personal projects afterwards as well to help if necessary. If that’s not enough, what should I look at for next steps? 

I’m also wondering what field in software development I might fit best in - I really enjoyed the problem solving aspect in the course I took (it was mainly implementing data structures and algorithms from scratch), but I’m sure that’s not what jobs are actually like. From my limited knowledge, I think something back-end or data science would be more technical and might suit me better, but I’d love some opinions from people more knowledgeable. I’m also enjoying the web dev course, but I think that’s just because I’m enjoying the coding.",1620041954,t3_n3tvab,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n3tvab/engineering_graduate_looking_to_go_into_software/,4,9,1,1543187413,1,0,yvalent
449,n3p158,gabtessregg,dropping out of grad school for a career in CS?,"I'm currently getting my PhD in Biochemistry (hear me out), and year 4 will be wrapping up soon. People graduate on average in 5.5 years, I think I'll be longer than that. 

Right now, I work in a computational biology lab, so I'm writing code basically all the time - Python and some C++. We don't need details - but I'm thinking of dropping and want to know if a career in CS would be a viable alternative. 

I have a BS in Chemistry, and a minor in Computer Science, went straight to grad school after undergrad. The minor got me a lot of theoretical classes (data struct. and algorithms, probability, etc.). But I don't think I have that much practical experience. I've been coding for my thesis for \~3 years now but academic science coding is not the same, take my word for it. If I was to drop out, I would probably try to find a bootcamp to brush up my skills a bit more. 

I'm not worried about liking a career in CS, I think I would, but I am worried I wouldn't be a competitive candidate for jobs. Thoughts/advice about steps I would need to take to be a good candidate?",1620020973,t3_n3p158,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n3p158/dropping_out_of_grad_school_for_a_career_in_cs/,67,3,3,1549917297,1,0,gabtessregg

In all seriousness, I'm a bit worried about the job outlook I will have with a physics/econ BS and it's too late to now change my major. I'm an international student and as such my school limits me in how much time I can take. I'm thus thinking about how I might be able to get into CS as an alternative career option, despite having majored in physics. 

I know that physicists used to easily Segway into CS, but today, there are more than enough applicants who bring CS degrees to the table. Thus, I'm wondering how common / possible it is for a physics BS to go into a CS master's. 

How possible is that? Any suggestion? (I'm currently minoring in CS but don't know if that's enough...)",1620018298,t3_n3odxx,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n3odxx/is_it_still_a_thing_for_physics_students_to/,534,390,0,1586727248,1,0,NationalTechnician7
455,n3mnsq,Deep-Ad3797,What's the best pivot route for a Materials Engineer to Software Engineer?,"**TLDR:** I am a materials engineer who wants to switch to CS and picking web development route because it seems to be the most approachable but willing to hear out what others in the field think. I'm decent at leetcode and it kinda come to me easier because of my math background. But the caveat of this switch is maintaining a salary that helps out my fam for atleast now (willing to relocate anywhere I just help them financially). Wondering if it's doable and if so if you guys have advice.

**Long Form Explanation Below:**

1. I work at a semiconductor foundry as a materials engineer. I'm the guy trynna make sure the supply meets demand however, I want to switch over to CS because I don't like the location and I am decent at coding.
2. With my background I didn't know which direction to go through so I went on free code camp and just went the web dev route. Thought why not.
3. I want to leverage my previous technical experience so I was wondering if you all wanted to help me find my place in the Computer Science world. I already know python due to using for research before. However, the data science route seemed to be the most stringent on degrees and certifications. That's why I started to pick up web dev. Seemed the most fluid and I can knock out javascript and a couple projects by the end of the year.
4. My only caveat with not leverging my current resume is that I do have a salary requirement. I am right now helping my family out and paying for their bills along with mine for now since they got screwed by the pandemic. It won't be for long but I would need to maintain my salary of 89k atleast to do so. Is that doable if I switch? I can leetcode very very well. I am learning the whole algorithms and data structures aspect but, my math background kinda helps out a lot (I dual majored in math in college). This whole thing got brought up because my friend at Capital One landed about that much starting off in Texas. But I don't know if he was a fluke.

529,n2tbk9,algerbrex,Would going into cs be realistic if I major in philosophy?,"I'll elaborate on the title. Long story short, I've been blessed to be accepted to attend several different colleges. 

The one I've decided on however doesn't offer a cs major, or anything comparable. The other colleges I was accepted into all offer cs majors, but...they're not the colleges I want to attend, for different reasons. 

So since I've also been passionate about philosophy since middle school like programming, I decided to just double major in philosophy and business at my chosen college.

Here's my question. I still really like programming, and I would really like to pursue a career in the area after college, or even during it. But is that a realistic goal if I'm just getting a major in philosophy? I know I could go back to college, but at this point, I really don't see that happening.",1619908709,t3_n2tbk9,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n2tbk9/would_going_into_cs_be_realistic_if_i_major_in/,26305,23434,0,1549766808,1,0,algerbrex
