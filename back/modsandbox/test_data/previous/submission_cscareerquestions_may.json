        "body": "Hi all,   \n\n\n I was wondering if someone could shed some light on the following two things I have thought about recently (and a bit worried about).  \n\n\nIf you have CS subspecialties - like Software Dev (Web, Mobile), Data Sci, Cyber Sec - is it difficult to transition in-between when you are a senior?  \n\n\nFor example - mobile software dev and is a senior and wants to move into data science (because he/she got bored or whatever). Assuming you learn everything there is to know about Data Science on top of your 9-5 software dev job.   \n\n\nThe way I see it is a DS position with matching seniority would want years of commercial experience in DS regardless of what you know so the opportunities to do that seem scarce. The same goes for moving from mobile dev to web dev (altho better overlap to sell yourself).\n\n  \nAnother thing I see, but to a lesser degree, is that) if you work in an applied industry (assume no Big Tech but more like financial services) it is not that easy to sell yourself for matching seniorities in another - like a med-tech company or whatever.  \n\n\nI might be wrong so I would be really grateful for some advice. Thank you!",

        "body": "I don\u2019t post much and am more of a fly on the wall. But here it goes.\n\nTLDR: I just landed a new job that is a huge step up from my previous role. This job has me in the office more and the combination of not interacting with a single human for a year in 2020 and new job jitters has me saying stupid stuff in the office and experiencing massive imposter syndrome. I have no idea how to dig myself out and feel like total garbage.\n\n\u2014\u2014\nI am a fairly senior sys admin and recently transitioned into DevOps. This new job has a lot to learn but in my first week of actual work (2nd week since first was all onboarding) I was able to help implement a new logging system and... well I think I helped. \nPoint is that this new job is great and a huge pay bump but it is a cultural shift that has been hard to adjust to. My previous role was behind closed and locked doors or working from home. In my previous role dropping a f-bomb in a meeting was basically a given. We were a small team tucked away from the world keeping a non profit running. It sucked but it was also pretty free. This new job has an open office, very professional, and very controlled. I like that about the new gig but it\u2019s an adjustment.\n\nTake last Friday, everyone was chatty before the weekend. I have hardly spoken to anyone other than my dog and my few co-workers for a whole year. To say it was overwhelming is an understatement. And my default response is to say stupid stuff. I said a couple off jokes. And exaggerated a couple things. Nothing major but I feel like total garbage. \n\nAnother side to this job is that didn\u2019t even apply for it. The VP of recruiting found me on LinkedIn. That sounds like a great thing but it\u2019s really giving me a deep sense of imposter syndrome. I mean Google imposter syndrome and I check every box right now. Along with that, this company works much more differently than my past employer. It\u2019s a good thing. But it\u2019s hard to keep up and remember everything. I am two weeks in and feel like a failure. \n\nIf you read this far, thanks.\nMy questions are:\n\nHow do you handle cultural shifts? I am not a social person and neither are most CS people so I wonder how you all handle shifts and culture and the eventual missteps that happen.\n\nHow do you handle imposter syndrome? I keep on asking myself how this job happened. I did not lie on my resume. I was truthful in my interview. And I know my stuff. But I feel like this gig is a cosmic joke.\n\nLastly, how do you deal with companies with poor documentation? I\u2019m finding it hard to understand what is going on because there is little to no documentation.",

Also I\u2019m unsure if those answers would be different now considering some of those threads are 5-7 years old and the landscape could be dramatically different, what with covid and all.\n\nI have a BS in computer science from the University of Washington: Tacoma and I also live around the Seattle area.  I graduated two years ago and intended to take a few months off.  Before I knew it, I had spent two years doing nothing.  \n\nMost of the time I feel like I suffer from imposter syndrome but then I'll visit subreddits like this one and feel like I really do know nothing.  I'll come across job search horror stories on the front page of Reddit from people who applied to hundreds of jobs with little to no success and they have great qualifications and experience, of which I have none.  I was a pretty good student but I assume the real world work in this field is nothing like solving the random problems you do in class.  If it indeed is like solving advanced algorithms and using calculus on a daily basis then I'm in even more trouble, even though I passed and got the degree.\n\nI've had a burst of motivation recently and want to get back on track.  I have zero experience in the field and have no idea where to even begin.  It's all so daunting but I need to start somewhere.  Like school assignments, the hardest part for me is just getting started.\n\nWhat I have going AGAINST me:\n\n* I have zero work experience in the field, not even internship(s) \n* I now have a huge gap in my general work experience and understand that's frowned upon greatly\n* I don't know what to put in the projects section of my resume as I haven't really done much outside of school projects, of which all the other students have done so I can't differentiate myself from the competition.  Any projects I have done on my own are mostly incomplete or just very simple programs that I made for fun that relate to my life.\n* I've undoubtedly forgotten a lot from school, but could probably pick it back up if I grind/refresh for a few weeks.\n* Computer science is very broad and I'm unsure what type of job I should be applying for or even where I should be looking (LinkdIn, Indeed, etc?)\n* I live in the Seattle area and assume the competition is way beyond me\n* I have huge confidence issues but at the same time I don't want to sell myself short.  I've never had a job where I had to negotiate my salary/benefits.  I'm afraid of getting stuck in a job where I'm being taken advantage of.  I really have no idea what my worth is.\n\nWhat I have going FOR me:\n\n* I got a degree.  I almost burnt out in the last year of college and I don\u2019t think I can/want to get a master\u2019s degree.\n* Some might think I'm lazy, but I'm actually a hard worker and can grind/focus for long periods of time.\n* I was a pretty good student.  Not the best, but maybe top 20-30%?\n* I live in the Seattle area and although competition must be high, there's hopefully lots of jobs?\n* I'm vaccinated, have transportation, and don't mind working in an office/cubicle.  Although, I do like Washington and want to remain local and not move out of state for a job.\n\nThanks so much if you actually took the time to read all that.  I could have added more but this is just what I can think of off the top of my head.  ANY advice is greatly appreciated! :)\n\n**tldr**: Have a degree, unemployed for years, no work experience in the field, no idea where to begin.  Any help appreciated!\n\nedit: I'm receiving quite a few replies and want to thank each and every one and also every new one!\n\nedit 2: I'm using a throwaway account so I'm going to make an edit now in case I lose access to the account.  I think I've gotten a better perspective on my situation and myself thanks to all your replies.  Here's a list of some of the things I plan to do from here (not necessarily in order):\n\n* Highly consider therapy (have to get insurance sorted out, see what's covered, if anything)\n\n* Go through all my assignments in college and see what I'm proud of or which projects demonstrate desirable traits and add them to my resume\n\n* Get back into the coding mindset.  Maybe learn to make some simple apps that I can use.  Practice (Leetcode, Codecademy, freecodecamp.com, etc)\n\n* Finish my resume and LinkedIn profile.  Add a bunch of people on LinkedIn that have tried to reach out to me.\n\n* Apply anywhere and everywhere\n\n* After an indefinite amount of time if I'm having zero success or improvement, consider boot camp options (A number of people suggested this but I can't deal with the cost right now). \n\n* Thanks for helping me",

        "body": "So I've been thinking about what to learn and work on outside of work to better market myself in about a year's time when I plan on searching for a new job. I'm having a dilemma as to if I should just commit myself to becoming more proficient in backend, either by learning a new framework, making my own apis, etc. or if I should just learn frontend and become a fullstack engineer.\n\nMy current position is completely backend, working on internal tooling, core api features, some devops work, improving our ci pipeline, aws stuff, etc with 1 yoe.\n\nIf I was going to focus on backend, I would probably learn another web framework in a different language (like spring boot or something, maybe some graphql), make my own apis, fully learn some of the tools I've used (since making modifications is different from starting from scratch), try to make some projects with a microservice architecture, dive deep into aws, networking, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, a few of my friends who are/have been at top companies suggest learning javascript and becoming fullstack. I do have a few months of html, css, js, react experience from school, but honestly probably not sufficient for a junior position. So if I go this route, I would finally learn those pesky css attributes, typescript, javascript, react, node.js, express, etc.\n\nThe problem I have with this is that the frontend ecosystem seems so complicated, always moving at a super fast pace, and definitely more saturated due to popularity and perceived lower barrier to entry. There's babel webpack, yarn, react, redux, typescript, sass, etc. and new frameworks and tools coming out at a seemingly really fast pace. It also seems like there's more variance and \"personality\" in how different people implement things on the frontend as opposed to backend. Also, I just don't like having to deal with styling, css (flexbox, grid, and honestly I still don't fully understand the different types of \"display\") and making sure things look good on screens of different sizes.\n\nSo I guess I do think that learning frontend will make me a better engineer and give me better opportunities and more flexibility in the future, but its it worth the pain points I specified above?",

        "body": "Hi everyone, the title sums it up pretty much, but here's some context.\n\nAfter having finished an hour-long interview on Zoom with one of the company's partners, they invited me over to their office a few days later. Then I talked to both partners for another hour, and they told me to come back after a few days, so they could check my technical skills. After that, if they liked me, they would offer me an internship, and, after three months, a junior position. When I asked them what the test would look like, they told me that I had to create a very simple landing page with HTML and CSS.\n\nI found this situation kind of odd, as the position I was applying for was advertised as a junior fullstack position, and suddenly I found myself creating a landing page for an internship, but I really liked the company, and went along with it.\n\nWhen I got there a few days later, I immediately got a briefing from their design team, showing me the website they wanted me to do. It turns out the \"very simple landing page with HTML and CSS\" was a fully responsive website with multiple components, and animations. And I had to perfectly implement the design provided by the design team. They gave me four days.\n\nAs I was pretty nervous and fed up at that point, I messed up and just told them that I would do it, without asking any further questions.\n\nA few hours later, they told me to regularly push the code on Github, because they wanted to see what I was doing. Also, after seeing the first versions of the website, they started to regularly text me, telling me that they wanted that font bigger, that image smaller, you name it.\n\nThe deadline's in two days, and I'm almost done, but I'm pretty stressed out, and confused about this whole process.\n\nThe questions I have are the following:\n\n1. Am I just overreacting, or are they asking too much?\n2. Is someone who's applying for an internship ever supposed to create a complex website on their own during the application process?\n3. Why in the world are they texting me and asking me to tweak the website according to their preferences?\n\nThanks in advance to everyone spending their time reading and answering to this post.",

The main issue is that no one in our team had previous web dev experience, so we learned on the job together and probably missed out on a lot of knowledge that comes from working with experienced developers (common pitfalls, industry best practices, pros and cons of different technologies etc.) so I'm not confident with my skills to get anything more than a graduate level job in web dev, which as someone whose title is currently senior software engineer I'd like to avoid.\n\nSo I'm wondering what the best way to go forward is - I've been looking at online courses on sites like Udacity and Coursera but from what I've heard they tend not to be strongly considered by recruiters - does that still apply if I have experience outside of them and am using them more to polish my existing experience?

It took a week to hear back from them and I feel like the only reason they even hired me was because (I assume) few people applied for the position (generally aimed at students) and I might have seemed like the most qualified person because I've already finished my studies. I do tend to overthink things and I never really feel like I deserve the opportunities I get. I doubt everything I do and I never feel like it's good enough. I've been trying to work on it and not be so hard on myself.\n\nI will be programming in Python and while I do have some experience of programming in Python, it's not a lot at all. The job listing didn't really have any requirements listed and they didn't really ask me about it in the interview. I've looked over the code and it seems simple enough. I understand what's going on in it but I'm afraid I'll run into problems once I actually start contributing to the project because I don't know Python too well. I'm afraid they won't be happy with my work.\n\nI've had a decent amount of time to prepare for the job and while I definitely have been preparing, I've also been avoiding it because I don't really know what to do or where to start.

        "body": "I\u2019ve been offered a position as a software engineer at a large defense contractor. I\u2019m unsure if I should accept, because I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll be competent. I\u2019m a recent graduate from a degree that isn\u2019t computer science, but somewhat related - my program focused on game development/ design and 3D/2D animation, with some programming courses (oriented towards building games in Unity). I took fundamental CS courses and struggled through them, failing two. So at all stages of the interview process, I tried to tell them I was no longer interested, because I didn\u2019t think I was competent enough. The interview process was mostly me talking about my experiences in game development and the internships I\u2019ve had. Somehow I was given an offer.\n\nFor the last 2-3 years, I\u2019ve had sights set on a career in product design, by learning what I could on the side outside of school, and working on things for my portfolio.  I\u2019ve been applying to UX/UI roles but I still have a lot more work to do on my portfolio, which would take probably months.\n\nI tried to be a computer science major in college, but I struggled through coding classes, and could never get my code to work without help. The internship I had as a programmer solidified why I don\u2019t think I\u2019m meant for software, and would enjoy UX/ UI more. I could tell that my manager and team at that job was expecting me to be better at coding and have more knowledge than I did. For example, I was struggling to write SQL code and had to get help with more complex queries. He picked up on my lack of skill and gave me visual design focused assignments. My reviews were good at the end, but I think it had more to do with my work ethic. I didn't get a return offer.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be in a situation where I\u2019m incompetent again. I\u2019m willing to self-study and put in the work by practicing what I can for this job, but don\u2019t know if it\u2019s realistic that I\u2019ll compare to SWEs with a whole degree in CS that I don\u2019t have.\n\nThroughout all my experiences in tech/ engineering, I\u2019ve felt like an outsider who has little understanding of what\u2019s going on.  On the other hand, design feels more natural.  I\u2019m also just a lot more interested in solving design problems than I am in technical problems.\n\nI\u2019m considering taking this job as I continue to work towards a career in product/ UX design. My biggest concern is that I\u2019m not a CS major and not a strong programmer - that I\u2019 be an actual impostor.\n\nAs I\u2019m hoping people here have more experience than I do, I wanted some opinions.\n\nIs it possible to overcome the fact that coding isn\u2019t a strength, while working on the job?\n\nIs someone like myself likely to end up being a bad hire for the company?\n\nIs it realistic to believe I could accept this job and work at being competent through self study?\n\nAny resources I could use that helped you get better at coding and understand the concepts more clearly? this is what I've always struggled with.",

My spouse is quite worried about it, however I have never heard of this being an issue. I love working at MS and I want to work there again as an FTE, but at the same time AirBnB is offering more money and I am getting out in September anyhow, they specifically told me they are not going to renew my contract and they don't want to hire me as an FTE (at least my team manager doesn't want me for some reason, ugh, I am guessing he doesn't like me or whatever, see if I care)\n\nAt the same time, the gig at MS is pretty chill and I worry going over to AirBnB and the team turn out to be assholes.

(Starts in September)\n\n\\-Can start applying for jobs September 2022 (if not hired by corporate internship to stay on full-time)\n\n\\-No guaranteed job, but they do have job placement services following the program.  \n\n\\-Costs $0 and even has a small (\\~$1200/month) stipend for living expenses.  \n\n\\-Language taught is Java.  \n\n\\-Average salary following program that is advertised is $40k, but I have a bit more general work experience and education than most students.\n\n\\-Side note:  This program is less-intensive & the hours are better for holding a part-time job during the program, but it does come with a potential commute (if they go back to in person) of between 30 min-1 hour (depending on where my wife and I buy our new house).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Option 2:  App Academy.**  \n\n\\-6 month bootcamp (Starts end of June)\n\n\\-Can start applying for jobs end of December 2021\n\n\\-\"Guaranteed\" job placement (deferred payment until you have a job).  \n\n\\-Costs 15% of annual salary up to 3 years or $31k, as long as you are making a minimum of $50k.  \n\n\\-Languages taught are JavaScript and Python. \n\n\\-Average salary is advertised at \\~$80-85k, though I fear that is inflated by their main offices operating out of high cost of living areas (San Francisco & NYC).  (Note: $80k salary, minus 15% comes out to $68k, but since this is paid after taxes, we'll call it equivalent to \\~$65k).\n\n'\n\nI'm hoping to get any advice I can.  Obviously App Academy comes with a fairly high price tag, but getting to start working 8 months sooner helps alleviate some of that (depending on actual salary, of course).  I do have some personal connections through my family to the business that is running the corporate internship for Year Up, though, so I feel confident I could land a job there following Year Up.\n\nUltimately, while money matters, I want to make sure I'm making the correct decision to set myself up for a successful start to a new career path.  So any advice you can give me is highly appreciated.\n\nEDIT:  Update, I have officially accepted the position at Year Up.  I'll leave the thread up just in case it helps anyone in the future.  Thank you to everyone who commented.",

Should I be running for the hills?\n\nAny advise those with experience in this area might have would be very much appreciated.",

Yes, I can make up for some of those gaps at work in practice, but my position has become more precarious recently. It's a very real possibility that I will lose my job soon, so I won't really have that practical learning environment.

I think learning in a low-stakes environment like a classroom may be much better for me. \n\nIs this the wrong mindset? Am I equally likely to cover my gaps in knowledge and ability in a real job?

For a junior programmer in a third world country, those are golden opportunities. Some offers go for as high as 20$/hour. With this salary, you can live like a sheikh. You land a \"sketchy, underpaid, informal job\" by American standards, and you're suddenly rich, earning 20x minimum wage.\n\nI found a lot of these offers extremely approachable. Maybe I got lucky, but I got a nice opportunity with minimal experience. I'd get far into interviews without even being familiar with the tech. For how poorly the game dev scene is talked about, this seems way too good to be true.\n\nAnd that brings me to my point: is this really just a gold mine for people in my position, or would the average SWE route be even better? Maybe that's just how computer science works in general, and if I were investing my time into learning, say, C# .NET backend, I'd be getting even more opportunities and way higher salaries. I'm sure this is the case for \"big boy jobs\", but once again, this is a \"cs student with 1 YOE\" kind of deal. The bar is veeeery low for these gamedev jobs, which is why I managed to get into it in the first place. Maybe it would be impossible to land such a job if I were in another field?\n\nWhat do you guys think about this? Cause if I can get into a new field just as easily, and have even more of these intern-esque job opportunities, that'd be amazing. Or maybe I can aim straight for the more professional jobs. I don't think I wanna be a game dev after I graduate, so a more standard SWE job would work better in my CV. Please share your thoughts, and thanks a lot in advance!",

        "body": "I recently quit my job and got another one (pays 15k more) as an IOS dev, it's a scale-up. During the interview process they told me they care about Unit tests, clean coding, architecture, work-life balance and SE best practices (classic lies but devs sounded legit), turned out all of them are bullshit. fast forward to my 2nd month at work (never had onboarding btw cuz everybody is too busy) I have to work on shitty code with no proper architecture, it's a mess and only one of the devs knows about project, if he leaves this company they are fucked up big time. I have to work 10 hours a day because they always rush for releases, they do absolutely horrible practises like approving PR's without even checking because they have no time, and if PR passes with bugs they blame the PR creator. I'm already sick of this job, should I just chill for 5-6 more months and pretend I'm caring or start looking for a new job? Do you think it's a red flag to switch jobs after 2 months? Thanks..",

However, Company B and Company C have deadlines coming up (to accept the offers) and Company A said they would take anywhere from 1-2 weeks to provide a response. (When I was moving through Company A\u2019s interview process, they would usually be on the longer end so most likely closer to 2 weeks)\n\n\\- Initially, I had told Company A that I had no offers, but that has since changed. Would telling Company A that I have two other offers be a good idea in terms of speeding up their decision making? I am a bit hesitant because I do not want to force their hand and have them rush a decision that I will later regret.\n\n\\- If I were to tell Company A that I had other offers, how much am I allowed or supposed to disclose to Company A? Company name, compensation, none? I am a bit hesitant because the offers are not for the same positions. Also, if Company A asks and I choose not to disclose any information, would it seem like I am lying? \n\nShould I just try and wait for Company A to make a decision? Should I tell Company A about the other offers and convey that they are my first choice?  I would definitely go with Company A (if given the option) so that is why I would like a decision from them as soon as possible, but I am not sure the best route to take. \n\nI have never been in this position before so any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

It has been exhausting. Many of the applications were to mid level roles which probably inflates the numbers and reduces the application to interview ratio.  \n&nbsp;\n  \nSome other factors that likely increased difficulty:  \n* between junior and mid level, higher salary than grad but not skilled as mid level  \n* below average theory and design knowledge (learned a lot by doing/working code level rather than reading)  \n* don't want to grind leetcode  \n* don't wanna spend so much time on projects  \n* don't wanna read books so much  \n* average intelligence  \n* started job hunt without prep and never really went all the way  \n* global pandemic, businesses feeling high fear and risk of unknown, higher unemployment/furlough/competition  \n&nbsp;\n  \n*Ok but that just makes you sound entitled, do you even like programming?*  \n&nbsp;\n  \nI love thinking about and solving problems. Being able to see, investigate, understanding systems. Debugging and finding the exact source of bugs. The clarity of mind programming can help me reach and the feeling of superiority is amazing.  \n&nbsp;\n  \nWhat I have done:  \n* I have 5 iterations of my CV based on feedback from reddit and people irl. At some point I stopped making changes cause the finer points are quite subjective and it goes back and forth.  \n* I've been slowly making progress reading books C# in depth and Refactoring over the last 2 years (started before job hunt and still in (very slow) progress)  \n* Doing Andrew ng's ml course. There are courses I could take better/more relevant to web dev and .net dev but I find ml more interesting :/ (started this before job hunt too taking 2+ years so far)  \n* Collecting interview questions I've come across and creating flashcards with answers on quizlet  \n* Writing down my answers for non technical questions  \n* Writing short generic cover letter used in some applications  \n* Every weekend applying to as many suitable (junior-associate) job ads that have come up in last 7 days as I can  \n&nbsp;\n  \nIt's hard to get good feedback/any feedback. Ghosting is very common especially with external recruiters. When I wasn't ghosted a lot of the feedback I received were either there was someone better, I wasn't at the right level (for mid level positions) or generic you were good but not good enough.  \n&nbsp;\n  \nIn the end it's very hard to see what I did right here and what I did in the other interviews. I thought I didn't do as great in the online assessment (got 61/100) as I'd done in some others. There wasn't a take home assessment for this one but I thought I did really well at that in application to another job ad. The interview went as well as any other.  \n&nbsp;\n  \nThe only thing different is they came back and said they really like me. Job was actually for support developer, but when that changed to they just wanting support staff they got me for junior dev instead.  \n&nbsp;\n  \nTldr - market is shit, corona, wanna improve but dont wanna live and breathe code, got job victory lap, not sure what I did right",

        "title": "Senior FE eng. Lost in further career path (engineering manager), and losing mental health over it.",
        "body": "I had expressed my interest in the engineering management path in my current company around October last year. Shortly after, the company introduced the concept of provisional roles. At the same time we grew super fast, had reorgs split bigger teams into more focused ones, and creating new teams for new projects. However, I haven't heard anything concrete since then. Several other engineers with the same interest were bumped to provisional management roles recently (they're super smart and have a lot of software engineering experience, so no hard feelings, really). But because of that I started having a hunch that I'm not even in the middle of potential managers list (almost no BE or SWE experience).\n\nIn the beginning of the year I was really proactive about the new path: reading all kinds of management related material, taking initiative on stuff, trying to mentor anyone I can, introducing team workflow suggestions, learning about leadership, etc. My manager handed me over some smaller tasks of theirs. I've also been getting very positive reviews from colleagues in our feedback cycle, and I know a person who is vouching for me regarding this new role. And while my manager supports me in this endeavor, they told me it's not really in their control: a spot has to open up and their manager's manager calls the shots.\n\nI'm starting to doubt which path to choose or what to do with my career. I'm not coding properly for more than half a year (a lot of project management and coordination falls on engineers now due to PMs being moved out of our teams after reorg; and because our team is light on BE work right now, BE guys take more FE tasks, and I'm left with some leftovers or basic BE tasks). I'm not opposing to those tasks beause I'm taking more management related responsibilities and learning. But at the same time I'm not doing any actual management because I'm not on that provisional role and not sure I will be. So while I learn something about management, my FE skills are expiring, to the point where I sometimes don't even know how to help a colleague with a more difficult problem anymore. I'm not even sure if I'd even get a senior role in another company, tbh. So feel like I'm stuck in some kind of limbo state, with my skills not being relevant, with morale and mental health going down, and no actual plan for when and if I can get a provisional role.\n\nI'm also told: be visible, contribute to other teams and participate in other teams' discussions, basically - be all over the place. But everywhere I look things are so BE or SWE oriented, and information is flying across so many Slack channels, that it's hard to contribute anything while also having a bunch of your own tasks to accomplish.\n\nThat being said, I'm starting to have a lot of conversations in my head: Do I have too high of expectations to jump from FE to EM role? Is this provisional role the carrot that the company is hovering in front of me, so I keep having hopes for this change, and, as long as I get the job done on my menial FE and some junior level BE tasks, it's ok from company perspective? Am I just comfortably numb? Will I become irrelevant in the job market if I continue like this?\n\nSo I guess the main questions are:\n- What is a reasonable time after expressing interest in the role and actually being considered for it? half a year? a year? 3 years? \n- Can I even have hopes to jump to engineering management as FE engineer?\n- Should I just focus on FE work (even if it means moving to another team or job), and gain back the knowledge I'm losing?\n- should I set some kind of time limit to be offered this provisional role? if so, what is reasonable?\n- anything else I should be doing to make it?",

        "body": "Hi, all.\n\nFirst time caller. First time fan.\n\nI'm currently finishing up my expected core curriculum for a CS-related degree at a community college and must now face the decision of where to go and what, precisely, to declare. My focus for a while has been in cybersecurity because of the job potential and job security (I know, it's a pun, but I can't think of another way to say it).\n\nHowever, now I face the choice between two school with different degree programs. One is cheaper and has a Software Engineering program that seems cool, and others which don't seem to necessarily be what I want. The other is a bit more expensive, but has an Applied CS degree that they have said allows for specialization into cybersecurity.\n\nI'm told by friends in the CS field that the specific type of degree one acquires is of little consequence in the end. It's the having of a degree that matters. I'm still not sure what would best set me up for the field I want to get into. I do like coding. I literally had a dream last night where I joyously taught someone C++. I just don't know if the cybersecurity field cares as much about coding ability as something like, say, video game development.\n\nI would be really intrigued to know what feedback any of you can give, and if you have a recommendation for other career paths that might fit, I would be happy to hear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest wishes.",

        "body": "I\u2019ve been a Junior Software Engineer at my company for almost two years now (it's my first job since graduating university), and I\u2019ve gone above and beyond my job description. Not only do I complete the standard bugfix/new feature/improvement tickets assigned to me, but I have also taken over both the entire regression test suite as well as the build configuration when our tester and the software engineer responsible for the build configuration got laid off due to COVID. In addition to this, I also was recently responsible for onboarding a new tester to the team about a month ago and I regularly support them with any questions they have with testing.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that I'm not a tester, and I was not hired to be responsible for the build configuration, but since we were short of staff I took on the responsibility for both of these areas with no complaints, and have done an admirable job considering.\n\nAt the start of October 2020, a year after I was hired, I put forward my case for promotion to my manager. He agreed that it certainly seemed like my performance merited a promotion, and so I arranged a meeting with him and my senior manager. During this meeting I presented my case and demonstrated how I met each of the company's requirements for the role of Software Engineer. At the end of this meeting, my senior manager said that he doesn't see any reason why I shouldn't be promoted, and that he would give his recommendation to HR.\n\nIn November 2020\u2014after a month of being told that \"there are discussions being had with HR and we are just waiting for some of the other Junior Software Engineers to have similar meetings\"\u2014I was told that, somehow, there was no existing process for promoting software engineers from Junior to Mid level, and so before any decisions could be made, HR would have to create some kind of process to ensure that people are promoted fairly and consistently across the board. Fair enough, that makes sense, but how this didn't already exist is beyond me.\n\nFinally, in December 2020, HR set up a meeting with myself and the other Junior Software Engineers to explain the process of applying for and receiving a promotion. The general idea was that you should first get in touch with your manager and present your case for promotion and explain how you meet the criteria. If your manager recommends you based on this, you would be given a technical assessment. If you passed this, you would be promoted. I was also told that, since I had already had a meeting with my manager, that I would be able to move straight to the technical assessment. However, since this was a new process, the technical assessment would have to be created, and wouldn't be ready until at least February or March 2021.\n\nIn February 2021 I received an email from my manager telling me that they were requesting that I fill out the form they had created for this first step, which meant that I had to have another meeting with my manager to enter the details we discussed back in October 2020 into the form so that it would be the same as all the other juniors. (We actually had two meetings, because apparently the first time we filled out the form it wasn't done exactly the way HR wanted it. Nobody had done the form the way HR wanted it.)\n\nTwo months go by, and then in April 2021 I finally receive my technical assessment. I complete the assessment and present my solution to a panel of three senior engineers and one HR employee. The feedback I received at the end of the meeting was incredibly positive, and they said that they would need to compare their notes and come back to me with a decision.\n\nAbout a week and a half after that, HR explained that, although the panel felt I had performed \"incredibly well\" on the assessment day, they needed to wait until the other engineers had also completed *their* technical assessments, to ensure that the decision making was fair, but that I should hear back by the end of May (and that they would keep me updated).\n\nWell, it's the end of May and I still haven't received a word of feedback. I feel that I've been more than patient throughout this process, but **eight months** is a crazy amount of time to wait for a decision on whether or not I should be promoted, especially when I have been doing the work of a Mid-level Software Engineer this entire time. I can't help but feel that if I took eight months to do any part of my job (not counting some long-running project, and even then I would need to have more deliverables than this) and provided as few updates as I have received in this process, I would be fired.\n\nMy question is this: do I stick it out? Wait for the promotion that I can only hope is coming? Or do I start applying around for other jobs and accept a better offer when it comes?\n\n**TL;DR:** Applied for a promotion once I met the criteria provided by my company, and am still waiting on a decision 8 months later. Is it time to look for better jobs? Are there other companies out there that are better than this?",

They are looking for a new Junior Developer to take in for a big project they got coming up. There has been no job posting for the position or anything and after a quick interview, the manager hasn't made it clear on what I'll be doing if they actually hire me. Up until now, I've been avoiding sending my resume to postings that have to do with languages other than Java.\n\nThey mostly work with C# but they also have a small Java team. I'd really like for my career to be on Java. I like it, I have worked with it more than any other language and I've been advised by other friends who work in the industry that it's a good choice. However, I'm constantly thinking that maybe they will make me an offer, but I'll have to work with some other language. Or that sooner or later, I'll have to just accept that any job is fine, if I don't find the position I'm looking for soon enough.\n\nSo is my thinking rational and valid? Is there such a thing as a career based mainly on a certain language? Won't I be at a disadvantage in the job market if I end up working with something else but in the future I deside to try again for a Java position? Are language switches common in our line of work?\n\nAny tips on the matter, other than answering my questions would also be greatly appreciated.",

I'm a Hindu and my father (who is an extreme Hindu) warned me not to trust such organization as according to him, I being a minority, can fall prey to something bad when the office will be opened after lockdown.\n2. I'm not sure whether he will pay my salary on time or not as the India development centre has just opened.\n\nSo, I'm confused whether I should join his organization or not. What will you guys suggest?  Please don't consider me as having anything against Muslims. It's just that I find this slightly awkward.",

        "body": "I was hired as a devops engineer for a new team which focuses on using cloud and bringing a specialized site reliability engineering team to customers. Idea was not to sell us as traditional consultants but as a team to build things like CI/CD, cloud migrations to cloud and bring in all the necessary components for DevOps, GitOps and SRE. Needless to say I was actually really interested in this opportunity to work as a member of a team and we'd bring in the full package.\n\nIt all started extremely well with a good customer. I was early member of the team and the initial feedback was solid. We were happy and brought in good cash for the business. But then the senior architect resigned and joined another company. The project was put on hold and I was left in vacuum. Basically my days were just a few interviews and prepping for certification exams.\n\nNow this went on for a few months and I started to get quite anxious. At the same time paid learning was nice but there was the other side of the coin that I was doing nothing. Later on the sales contacted me that I was sold as a consultant. At this point I almost crashed because doing traditional consulting was not something that I wanted to do and definitely something I didn't sign up for. \n\nNeedles to say the project was a disaster from the beginning because I was sold as a sub-contractor. The scope of the contract changed from a month until further notice but there was no written agreement about hours which I were to put in. I was really stressed out with the constantly changing requirements and my unclear position. \n\nSo I cracked and failed to deliver. Now the management was angry because the customer pretty much said that they don't trust me and I don't blame them. I failed and I'm not making excuses. I lacked clear communication, I didn't ask enough questions and I presumed too many things. So of course I failed. \n\nNow I'm at the point where I have no idea what to do next. What started with big promise became a literal nightmare. Team we tried to build failed and the architect who recruited my left. There was no DevOps solutions team which brought me on board. Worse, I know the names of 5 colleagues and my only input is occasional team meetings where I say stuff like \"Nothing new\" but the only person to person meeting is once a month with HR. Other than that I have no idea about my supervisor, my team or what on Earth is my current objective or what is the strategy or personal growth plan for me. \n\nI don't know what to do. I'd feel like to loser to give up after such a small term employment but on the other hand this isn't what was promised and I'm really unmotivated to go on with traditional consulting.",

        "body": "I was browsing workatastartup a couple months back and saw a posting that I found interesting enough to ping and find out more. Their product sounded great and the technologies they were using aligned closely with my experience.\n\nMy first inter view with them went great but things started getting strange fast. First I had an inter view with the CTO, then I had another inter view with the CTO. Then we set up one with the CEO, I figured that would pretty much be it since there's nowhere else to go from CEO, but then the CEO inter view was just asking probing life questions. We got to the end and it was very clear we would need further inter views since we hadn't even discussed salary/equity. So we set up a followup with the CEO.\n\nAt this point I was pretty confused about how many inter views they were going to have me do, but I was falling into the sunk cost fallacy and I assumed we were \"pretty much at the end\" but oh was I wrong about that. I also really thought their product was brilliant so depending on equity it seemed like it could be a great situation for me.\n\nI then had another inter view with the CTO. And then an inter view with their ML engineer. At this point I'm pretty sick of the inter views so I ask their ML engineer how many more inter views I'll have to do. They tell me this is the last one for sure since I've met everyone at that point. Turns out they were wrong as well. After that we did ANOTHER inter view with their only other backend engineer.\n\nFinally, they send me the offer, the only thing missing was one last chat to determine what my salary/equity balance would be, since it was mostly my decision how little salary I was willing to take for more equity. According to their email they were thrilled to have me join the team. The CEO wasn't available to chat about salary for another couple days so in the interim we set up a zoom call with the only other member of the team so I would have the chance to meet everyone before joining.\n\nI was assured that this would be a casual conversation just getting to know each other since we'd be seeing each other daily in standup and what not. So I hop on the call and I'm quickly greeted with another intense inter view. I figured this last team member just didn't get the memo that I already had the job so I answered their questions and went along with it although I was not in an inter view mindset so I was not as on my toes as I might have been otherwise.\n\nA couple hours later I'm greeted with a last email from the CTO, it was basically the exact opposite of the email offering me the position. Whole lot of business speech saying they've realigned their company values and they're sorry they can't hire me.\n\nSo all in all, an enourmous waste of time. Some red flags throughout that I was mostly ignoring because I was dying to know what an extremely well funded early stage startup is willing to pay one of their first 10 employees in salary and equity, but I still don't have that question answered.\n\nI'm a bit reluctant to say, but the final inter viewer told me how religious he was and then asked quite a few probing questions through which he could deduce quite a bit about me. Without giving all those details, I can't shake the thought that it's illegal discrimination, though not like there's much I can do about that. And it was a shit show either way.",

        "title": "C++ engineer or ML or Developer career paths?",
        "body": "Let me explain the broad title of this post.  \n\n\nAfter completing my masters degree in Electrical Engineering, I have been working at a very small startup for the last 3 years. I have been the only person here with technical know-how, so I did things my way, even when I didn't have complete knowledge of things. I have been coding in C++, with hobby coding in Python. Now I am realizing how detrimental it has been to not have a mentor and no direction. I am trying to get into a company where there is growth potential but I am struggling selling myself, because my work involved wearing many hats instead of honing my skills in one area. The only thing I have going for me right now is \"I have coded in C++ and developed a huge codebase from the scratch\". I have dabbled in some embedded C programming, and some databases but only enough to do the task at hand. I dread technical interviews because I only have superficial knowledge of things I have done.   \n\n\nMajority of job postings I see fall into one of these categories:\n\n(1)  Web development (Java, SQL, backend, front-end) - I'm not very keen on this path, but there are plenty of jobs for this. So finding a job would be easy here. Plus, possibility of being DevOps guy in the future, which is neat.\n\n(2) ML Engineer: Would love to do this as I have always had an interest in ML, and always been doing minor side projects on my own. I have, however, no industry experience with this, so not much to show for in my resume.  \n\n\n(3) C++ Engineer/Compiler Engineer/Linux/Embedded: While I dread embedded, I do have a lot of C++ experience. I have no experience with fundamental concurrency, efficient coding but I have accomplished the tasks at hand so far with C++.   \n\n\nNow (2) is my interest going forward and (3) is my experience, how do I improve myself? How do I sell myself, and also make myself worth selling?   \n\n\nQUESTION 1: In order to improve my basic C++ fundamentals for those tricky technical interview questions, what book or video series do you recommend? I feel like I need to learn C++ from the ground up to make my understanding thorough.  \n\n\n QUESTION 2: Any tips for interviews in the meantime? I have started doing Hackerrank challenges with Python currently, and I struggle a bit, but sometimes I surprise myself. Is there a way to improve competitive coding in a structural manner or should I just keep doing random Hackerrank challenges?  \n\n\nThank you for reading a long post!",

In how much time do I need to search job after June I don't have my degree yet nor result of final sem , I heard you need to find job after college as soon as possible if you are in IT field , if I apply for job after 6 month when my college end I will have problems getting hired because there is 6 month gap from my college to job. Do such a thing happen and if yes how much time do I have after college, do that time start after ,end of exam , after result (online) or after I have degree with me.\n\n2. After exam end and I have no job should i apply for course , people says in india you need to know Java to get a job I can learn it by myself but do I need certificate and how much helpful is certificate with skill or just skill without certificate. Should I do course on artificial intelligence as I know python or any other new tech instead of programming language. ( I will do course on edx and Coursera for free without certification will it be considered ,I am not in the position where i or my parents can pay for course ). \n\n3. Should I apply for internship? I heard angel list is good place for internship. if any guidance on how and where to apply will be helpful . how much skill do I need for internship? Skill that I mentioned above is that enough for internship?\n\n4. Do your first job have impact on your entire career ? If I apply for tech support I will surely get it . My friends said take whatever job you get at first but I have see one interview of wall street on youtube\n\" your first job decides your career and have lasting impact throughout\"  name of that video is \"what class of 2021 grads should expect in the job market\" does it have impact throughout or I can apply for now in tech support or call center jobs I don't want to do it if it I would have problems with my career ahead. \n\n5. As in same interview editor in chief of linkedin said \" you are more 4 times more likely to get jobs from your network ( refferal etc) then applying\" do fresher get refferal how do I get one do people online on platform like linkedin give refferal and what other platforms I can get one . Any tips on building network for job.\n\n6. Any must have skill to get a job ? That I lack have not mentioned. \n\n7. Which project should i make. I have made project like 3 but they are small projects I don't think they can get me hired do number of projects matter. Or just  project that are difficult and advanced one or two in quantity is better then four five small projects.\n\n8. Should I do competitive programming online on platform like code chef, top coder , code war . What are other platforms online that I can do project in team to improve my skill in both communication and programming related.\n\n9. Any additional tips and guidance that you can provide.\n\nThankyou",

        "body": "For context: I have been unemployed for a year. I have 10 years of experience in my field and made close to 100K salary in my last role. More than once, I have applied for a job requiring 3-5 years of experience and on the interview, it is suggested to me that they see me as a better fit for the entry-level role they also have open, which requires 1-3 years of experience. I used to simply respond that that was not what I was looking for and move on.\n\nHowever, I have gotten nowhere in my past year of unemployment, so I have also started applying for these jobs with 1-4 years' experience required - just out of curiosity, I suppose. FYI, even those jobs requiring 3-5 years of experience are jobs very similar to roles I have held in the past so the problem is not that I don't have relevant experience.\n\nI often get interviews for the jobs requiring 1-4 years' experience, and holding out for an appropriate job for my amount of experience has not worked out so far which has led me to consider these jobs. The salary is always low - for me - but probably in line with what someone with 1-4 years of experience would expect for the job.\n\nAs I may simply have to resort to taking one of these jobs which require 1-4 years of experience, I want to try to get the salary up as much as possible. My question is: how would you negotiate an increase in salary under such circumstances?\n\nIt seems blatantly obvious to me that both a person with 1-4 years of experience and one with 10 will be able to do this job, but the one with 10 will - barring any exceptional reason - do the job better, more efficiently, etc. That alone would justify paying the more experienced person more (especially, in my case, since this is a role I have held already - just at different companies). I will make this point, but I am concerned that they counter simply by saying: \"this is the budget for the role\".\n\nSo my questions are these: what can one say to that? How would you negotiate a salary increase in this case?\n\nLooking to hire someone with my experience into such a role and insisting on paying them the same as they would someone with the amount of experience they are asking for just seems to me like trying to cheat your employees. Obviously that isn't something one can say in a negotiation, though I think shame is a more effective means to getting someone to increase the salary than expecting decency.\n\nOf course, I am hoping to have multiple offers at once in order to have more leverage in the negotiations, but actually getting multiple offers at the same time in order to leverage them has yet to happen to me, nevermind getting just one offer in these pandemic/economically challenging times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny ideas would be great.",

I know it could be my fault that I should have started job-seeking much earlier, but what I have been told before I go to colleges is colleges DO help you in terms of career, which turns out that they DON'T. Oh, they DO charge you fees.\n\nSince education won't help, I devote much of my time to developing toy projects, hoping that this will become parts of my portfolio.  But I was told by some chaps that toy projects also won't help and are going to be ignored by the recruiters. They also told me that what recruiters want is projects that are fancy enough. I don't know how to develop a fancy project, although I can make a twitter clone with the help of frameworks. I don't have a mentor, nor can I afford tutorials for a fee, and I have to say that the outcomes of these tutorials don't seem quite fancy.\n\nSince both universities and side projects won't help, I find that I have trapped in a catch 22 situation.\n\nCompanies require years of experience but you have to got a job first to gain experience.\n\nI got 0 interviewing after rejected by tens of applications.

I was put into the Automation team, which is totally out of my area of expertise as I have had no background in computer engineering.

But being this early in my career, I have heard sayings like \"You shouldn't fixate yourself on one field this early\", so I am super confused on how to proceed. \n\nShould ask my manager for a switch to another team, as this will result in severing whatever relationship I have built with my manager (which I might regret later). Or should I keep at it and see where this takes me. I guess it boils down to:\n\n1. Is it recommended to work in a field that I see no future in yet, but does broaden my skill set? \n2. Will it put me at a disadvantage if I dont get direct exposure to datascience projects, if I do want to pursue datascience in future?\n3.

        "body": "I am a US citizen living overseas in Thailand (a low cost of living country). I know the advice is to work in the states for a few years first before getting a remote job, but it's quite impossible to go back right now as my wife doesn't have a visa and we would like to live here. My career options are either finding a remote tech job that pays $30,000+ /year or continuing to teach English (less preferable) for $30,000.  \n\n\nIn other words, I would be wasting my degree if I didn't find a tech job, but I really don't plan going back to the states anytime soon. I like my life here. \n\nI currently have a part time remote job doing Wordpress for a small branding company (originally a contract but they kept me). I somewhat like the job and the pay is decent, but I only get about 5 hours per week of work. Wordpress is better than teaching English, so I'm open to doing Wordpress as a career if I can't get a remote junior position at a software job. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any career advice for someone who isn't too picky about what work I do, as long as it's remote?",

        "body": "First off, I've lost many years so far due to not knowing what I want to do in life (but being raised to see no other way than studying) and due to my own stupidity. Which means:\n\nI finished high school in 2016. Now five years later, it's 2021, I'm 23 years old and I still don't know what to do in life and haven't really studied anything yet(despite being applied to stuff). You can read the details about this at the bottom of this post.\n\nEven though I fear that the mathematics will be a challenge, I am now planning to switch from my current subject over to computer science, because I think that this will give me the opportunity to land a stable and well paid job and possibly allow me to work from home, somewhen. I think that this knowledge will give me the motivation required to keep going. I am not 100% sure whether this is a good reason to study computer science though, of whether computer science is the right thing for me. Thus, I'm asking you these. Do you think that these are good reasons to choose computer science?\n\nWhat doors will a Bachelor of Science in computer science open up for me? What pay can I expect (in Germany)? How much of a difference will a Master of Science make? Is a M.Sc. required? Is the study stressful? Is the job stressful? What did you struggle with the most, while studying and in jobs? What does an everyday workday look like?\n\nThank you!\n\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\nDetails:\nAfter high school, I chose computer science because I didn't know what else to do and the deadlines for applying at universities had already passed (computer science's deadline is a day before the actual semester starts here).\nI was therefore officially studying computer science for two semesters, but quickly lost motivation and ended up writing no exams whatsoever, actually doing nothing due to my lack of motivation and thinking that's not what I wanna do. Initially I had been wanting to study engineering for years before, but at the last moment, the kind of maths done in university induced anxiety into me. After those two years of computer science I unapplied and did nothing for a year, trying to find a path, then cluelessly applied to business and economics (called science of economy here) and tried to do that but it doesn't interest me at all. Wrote two exams so far. Then covid hit and ever since, I've been dragging my life out and being depressed because this wasn't what I liked either... six semesters later, now, I know that I might want to change the subject once and for all, and go back to computer science. I am scared of the mathematics but I think it's nothing I can't learn if I am motivated and think that's where I want to go, but I'm not entirely sure, hence the question.\n\nI currently work a well-paid part time job while still being applied fo business and economics. Even though that part-time job is in a world wide company (Parcel deliver service & supply chain logistics) and therefore has good ways of rising up into higher management etc., it will get me absolutely nowhere if I don't have a university degree. You require a degree to become something big there.\n\nBasically, I just want to finally find out what I want to do in life, and I'm running out of time and not getting any younger.\n\nTherefore, I'm now thinking about quitting my part-time job, use the time until september to refresh my maths knowledge and get a bit into coding, and then apply to computer science once again.",

Computers have always been my passion and I like to tinker with them and get to understand how we make them work. Before college, the plan was to major in music for scholarship money along with Comp sci, however, my advisor told me no and that doing the two was impossible together. Fine. I\u2019ll go into the BSBA route for Computer information systems with a track of information security with music. Still in the field of interest, but not what I really want. Id love to go into comp sci full on. The issue is that college is expensive and music offered me a full tuition scholarship. Recently, I was informed of a BA in computer science. Not heavy with science courses, but it looks doable with the music degree. Obviously, this is heavily towards a creative path as opposed to science. It gives me the range to do what I want while doing something that helps pay the bills. Even though it\u2019s a BA, are technical jobs still possible with it? What would you do?",

I do know that most tech jobs ask for a BS and that was my original goal, but, my AS took me four years to complete due to debilitating physical and mental health issues. There's only so much that I can manage to do, and I need a lot of time to complete tasks as I struggle to focus or to actually do anything due to any combination of my symptoms which flare up unpredictably. (In fact, I'd say that I'm hardly functional as a person but let's not get into that--)\n\nSince July 2019 I've been working with a job coach to help me find employment, and I've been reassured that I can still get a job even with just the AS, but I can't help but to feel discouraged and utterly unqualified. Not only that, there's the persistent notion that even if I *do* miraculously land a job at all, I won't be able to perform well enough for my employer due to all of my health problems. No one wants a worker who can't complete what's required of them, when it's required, etc.\n\nI have no prior job experience, and I suppose that my skillset is quite limited.

There's a ton of issues at the company that I'll list some below too. \n\nWe have no formal software design process at the company.\n\nOur code base needs work before it's completely technically bankrupt. \n\nOur teams are poorly structured and the scope of knowledge shifts frequently \n\nMany new hires left in their first six months.\n\nThere's just so many more...\n\nI spoke to the new engineering manager and he seems completely out of touch with what the engineering staff wants and needs. He seems to really value these pseudo science personality tests. Meyer Briggs and DISC being the two he mentioned. He told me directly that I will never be good or happy at my job because I am a \"red\" person, apparently that's only for \"blue\" people. He wants to structure and hire predominantly based on these glorified horoscopes. He told me a ton of stuff that apparently nobody else knows about his vision for the company, I won't go into a ton of detail though. He often uses vague terms like \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" knowledge, as a solution to the problems I present, not that those are bad answers... But I need more than that? He also went down random side rants about unrelated and completely irrelevant topics. It was one of the strangest meetings I have ever had. I had concerns about professional growth, in terms of challenging work which were not addressed. I had concerns about job satisfaction that also were not addressed.\n\nIs this common in industry in your experience?

        "body": "Has anyone else noticed how recruiters/headhunters make contract gigs seem A LOT nicer than they actually are?  For example, I had a recruiter reach out to me this week saying a contract gig pays up to 70-73/hr, and she then said that is $145,610 to $151,840 a year (I had told her in a previous convo that I would maybe entertain regular perm FT jobs at 150k base, and then bonus/equity/options on top of that).   Quick math tells us that this comp range she provided is only true if you work full weeks for all 52 weeks of a year.  I have had several other recruiters make shitty conversions like that as well in their pitch calls sometimes using 50 instead of 52 (which is also ridiculous).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe icing on the cake is I usually respond to these messages saying that I am not open to working a contract roles, unless it is at a rate where it would compensate enough for the lacking/no benefits (it seems like a lot of these roles now offer somewhat okay health/vision/dental, and not much else) and increased risk (contractors are much more likely to be dropped), and then they often ask me for what kind of rate I'd need.  I basically take my TC (140-155k), and add what I'd need for a job hop this early in my tenure if it was a FT role (which is about 45k more), and add another 25k for the increased risk, the barebones benefits, and lack of a signing bonus - which brings it to about needing to be paid 210-225k.  I then divide that by the equivalent amount of days I work right now (I have 40 days off when I combine my PTO and Paid Holidays), so that would be 44 weeks.  That's about $119.31 to 127.84/hr.  When I give them a number like this, they respond like I am crazy.  They say they never see people getting paid that much at my level of xp (about 2 years), and then often say that their rate they are pitching is already extremely high for my level of xp.  I usually respond by saying that I understand, but that's what I'd need to make a contract role worthwhile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has happened several times now, and I am starting to feel a little crazy.  Am I right in thinking that these contract gigs are largely not worth it?   I live in Chicago btw.",

With this in mind, I was planning to take a summer course so that I can be on track to graduate next year without having to take a 5 class quarter.\n\nI just spoke with the CTO who is also going to be my supervisor regarding my schedule and he says that 20 hours is just the minimum and some people put in 30-40 hours a week. \n\nWhat's interesting is that I interviewed with the CMO and suggested that I could work past the 20 hour limit if needed and she reminded me that the internship is part time at 20 hours a week.\n\nShould i go with my supervisor's suggestion of 30 to 40 hours a week? If yes, is it too much to take a summer course along with the internship? Would just putting in the minimum(20 hours) be a bad look?",

Usually I login by 8am and close by 11 pm. Sometimes 1 am become usual . On the other hand , manager isn\u2019t even raising voice to the technically strong person and he gets all the privilege to say no.

For loop becomes very complex for me and small case and joins looks complex for me . juniors handle this with ease and it makes more pressure for me with more experience . Being questioned or being more pressure for unable to execute any programming or sql. Where should I learn for my experience and how can I implement a solution without hands-on .  They are able to close by 7 in the evening and doesn\u2019t own any responsibility. I\u2019m being middle men to understand all their issues , deliverables etc to the client.

Then once that had finished I was wondering what to do now? Like so many people who get to this stage and decide I have not really learned much and not really getting this, so I will give up. I think this is where a lot of self-taught devs drop off. You learn all the syntax and how to debug a syntax error and not really how to create something.   \n\n\nSo I decided to go to uDemy and learn how to make a [slack clone](https://slackclone-5f7d8.firebaseapp.com/).  That taught me so much about debugging, flex boxes and frustration. I built it and was proud of it. Now what next I am not job ready so let me try and build something else...   \n\n\nI decided to try my hand at React Native this was just before covid hit and I was furloughed from a job I hated. Which I was ecstatic about because it gave me time to code and cycle. I continued trying to make an app for my cricket club, which never materialised unfortunately. I continued playing around with RN and building silly apps that never got anywhere but I learned so much.   \n\n\nThen in December a recruiter had seen my Linkedin profile and decided to give me a call about a contract job, and said that they were keen to hire ASAP and I should have an interview the next day. He also told me the name of the company. He requested my CV and I sent it over with a link to various projects and my Github. Then I never heard back from him. I was ghosted by him.   \n\n\nI found the CEO on Linkedin and sent her a message with my CV and GitHub link and my story and being upfront and honest about this being my first job and I am keen to learn. I had a call with the CEO and the CTO that same day and got the job. I have been working at the company since January and I have been learning so much and improving each day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo for any devs trying to get a job:   \n\\- Don't give up  \n\\- Be relentless  \n\\- Always learn   \n\\- Publish your code on social media  \n\\- Write medium about what you are building  \n\n\nGood luck you can do it.   \nPS I am 36",

        "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nFirst of all, thanks for taking the time to look at this post! I'm a student studying for my undergrad in CS and I've become worried about getting a job after I graduate, particularly after seeing posts where the OP has submitted hundreds of applications, received only had a handful of interviews, and still hasn't seen a job offer. I haven't found the time/motivation to start any side projects, I'm not exactly sure where I want to specialize, I don't have any internship experience yet, and I've got about 1.5 years until I graduate. Needless to say, I think my chances of success for finding a job soon after graduation are weak at this point.\n\nFortunately, I've picked up on some of the insightful comments many of you have made on posts in this subreddit since I joined a week or so ago. All of this along with some things I've read on here has lead me to some questions, which I hope some of you can help me understand the answers to:\n\n1. It's becoming more apparent to me that choosing where to specialize in CS could be one of the best things I could do to prepare for a job. What resources are out there that could help me learn more about different specializations I could do? Is there any benefit to me trying to generalize my skills or should I focus on one specific area in my free time?\n2. Once I have an idea of what I might specialize in, it seems like doing side projects will be a good way to strengthen my resume/GitHub. Is it better to do these projects totally independent? Or are open source projects better to participate in? Would it be valuable to an employer to see that I've collaborated with one or more people in creating something? I understand that the answers here could depend on what specialization I go for.\n3. I'm hoping to qualify for some sort of internship next spring/summer. Should I take any internship I'm offered even if it doesn't align with the specialization I decide on? If I'm unsuccessful at getting an internship, what are some of the best ways to compensate for not having experience to speak of on my resume? \n4. Any other last tips or advice you've got for an undergrad student? I'm sincerely open to any input or feedback.\n\nThanks for your time, I apologize if a lot of these questions are too commonplace for a dedicated post. The FAQ section was helpful, but I was hoping to have some back and forth dialogue for follow up questions.",

I have ~3 years of experience and a degree.\n\nOut of nowhere recently the CEO presented a plan to totally change our core product from [partially completed technically complex and interesting thing] to [completely nonexistent generic SAAS thing]. I\u2019m profoundly uninterested in it as well as it being nowhere near anything I\u2019m experienced in, and I assume they picked up on that as they\u2019re trying to bring on someone from outside to lead it.\n\nThe company seems way too old (2 years) for this to be anything but a hail Mary, and the hours are already insane. For all I know myself and anyone working on the current product are going to be let go if the new one pans out. If I were a better person I would just accept that I got bait and switched and start interviewing. \n\nThat said, I don\u2019t want to go through interviews for a long time after just having done them. I have enough in savings for at least a few years, and some other projects I\u2019d like to put time into. What I\u2019m worried about is what such a short stint followed by a medium/long gap will look like, especially as an early-career developer. \n\nWill it invariably look like I got fired and then couldn\u2019t find anything? How long of a gap can I reasonably take? Do I even put a ~4 month stint on my resume, or just leave it out as if I\u2019ve been doing nothing for the last few months?

        "title": "\"FinTech\" vs. Data Analysis",
        "body": "Hello,\n\nI am a recent graduate who just got his Master's in economics. While I do love economics, my career interests moved more towards data analysis/data science some time during my degree. I am currently faced with two job offers and I am having a hard time deciding which job is the better decision.\n\nThe first job is a very unique position at a middle market investment firm. This would probably be my only opportunity to start in finance at this point, as they seem open to teaching me all about investment banking (something extremely hard to get into, which I missed the boat on years ago). This job is the first of its kind at the firm and combines finance and technology, but probably leans more towards finance. I don't know too much about the role, other than I am working directly with senior management and basically doing whatever they require. The responsibilities range from financial modeling to writing Python scripts to improving upon already existing apps. There is no chance of upward mobility as I would be an analyst working directly under senior executives. The best case scenario would be large bonuses and exit opportunities 1-2 years after being in the role.\n\nThe second job is basically the job I imagined I would have after finishing my program: a data analyst job at a large marketing company. This job is much more structured, has training included, and the expectations might be much lower. The responsibilities for the job are basically consulting clients using their data for marketing campaigns. This would be a great opportunity for me to gain professional experience in Python and SQL, in a relatively forgiving environment. There is a clear path to take to move up to more senior positions in the company. However, these take time and the company seems to not be very generous when it comes to bonuses and annual raises. But there is progression. Also, I already accepted this job offer so I would have to renege on it if I went with the finance job (which will make me feel very bad for a few hours).\n\nMy current thoughts are that I could always find a job as a data analyst, but this would probably be one of my last chances to work in finance. In economics coursework, the focus is more on statistics and theoretical models than finance and accounting. Therefore, it is difficult for someone to get an investment banking job from economics unless they prepared on their own time. The finance job is 40% more money and I anticipate the hours will only be 20% longer compared to the data analysis job. Again, the finance job is extremely unique given it is new to the company.\n\nI feel like if I asked 10 people which job to take, 8 of them would say to take the finance job. However, there are significant cons to taking the finance job over the data analyst job. Firstly, I would have to commute into Manhattan compared to working from home. This would remove 1.5 hours from my day total. There would also be other costs such as commuting costs and needing to wear a suit instead of a hoodie in my living room. Secondly, the finance job is much more volatile -- there is no training, no one at the company has ever done this job before; the firm is just testing it out. I'll basically be on my own in a high-exposure role. What if I don't perform? What if they realize it was a mistake to have this role? I could be out of a job very soon. I would like to think I can handle the pressure as I did go to grad school and can deal with pressure, but still something to acknowledge. I guess that would be it for the cons. Both jobs would require more than 40 hours, but I could at least salvage some hobbies with the data analyst job.\n\nSo, any thoughts would be great. Thanks in advance.\n\nI'll summarize the pros and cons below:\n\n**Finance Job**\n\nPros:\n\n* 40% more money\n* Investment banking clout\n* Sponsored license exams for finance industry\n* Can always find an entry level data analysis job with my credentials\n\nCons:\n\n* Have to renege on the data analysis job after already accepting offer.\n* Lose 1.5 hours of my day  and pay $130/month commuting\n* No training, no support\n* 20% longer hours (around 70 a week)\n* No upward mobility in company\n* Gets away from the strict Python/data analysis stuff I wanted to work on out of school\n\n**Data Analysis Job**\n\nPros:\n\n* Work from home\n* Training and support in role\n* Clear path to promotions\n* Less demanding work\n* Gain extremely relevant experience with software to pivot to a tech company later on\n\nCons:\n\n* 40% less pay\n* Will never work in investment banking\n* FOMO from not taking finance job",

The team that I work with consists of 3 developers including me. 2 other developers in the team are mid-senior level and I'm the junior one.\n\nWhen I joined the company I didn't get a mentor and I was put in a project where I had to learn new frameworks and languages. (JavaScript/Typescript, React.js and Three.js) without much of help.\n\nNow the problem that I'm having is that on daily basis I get stuck in my tasks. Most of the time my tasks consist of implementing a new feature that is related to another feature  which I haven't worked on and this is the reason I get stuck because I have hard time understanding my teammates codes. Some of the codes they have written are really complex 3D stuff that I really have hard time understanding and also because I'm still learning these frameworks and languages, it somehow makes it even more harder for me to understand their codes and sometimes even tho they explain to me something I still have hard time understanding.\n\nRecently I've realized that when I'm stuck and I ask for help, none of the other developers in the team are willing to help other than throwing some ideas around and small tips. It wasn't any different in the beginning when I joined the company but they were a bit more willing to help and show me stuff but now they almost don't want to help me anymore and they even verbally bully me sometimes for not knowing something.\n\nThis has brought down my confidence significantly and I'm afraid to ask for help anymore.\n\nI'm constantly trying to learn and improve myself in the frameworks and languages that we use but seem like I'm not improving or learning much because most of the time I'm stressed and have hard time focusing. \n\nI thought about finding a another job in another company but I don't want to quit and give up easily because the same thing might also happen in another company.\n\nHave you guys been in a similar situation?

        "body": "Hello r/cscareerquestions,\n\nI am a recent graduate (May 2021) from a top university. I entered into college as a biomedical engineering major and enjoyed some of the coding we did and picked up a computer science double major. For the longest time I was planning to go to graduate school, but recently I decided it wouldn't be a financially wise decision. In addition, I was facing a lot of mental health related issues and family issues my spring and fall semester of my senior year resulting in my final GPA dropping to 3.3. Long story short, I decided to enter the software job market really late (like last month) and have been applying to many junior software engineer and entry level positions. I have also been studying leetcode and systems design, while I apply around.\n\nI have 1 internship where I was working as an R&D engineer, developing some ML algorithms coding in Python and utilizing a fair amount of SQL. I also have also been working on a health tech start-up with some friends since my junior year and have learned quite a bit about full-stack software engineering. Although I don't think software companies care, I also have 2 published works and 1 technical patent, from research projects.\n\nMy problem seems to be I don't get any replies from most companies I apply to, presumably because most of the new grad positions are already filed (or my resume is trash). Last week, I was contacted by a recruiter of a small company (my LinkedIn has open to work) inquiring if I was interested in an associate web developer job. I just went along with the process and interviewed at the firm. I interviewed the next week and was then given an offer. The company works with .NET (C#), React native, and some mobile frameworks. I'm not sure which team I am assigned to but, the company essentially builds software tools for other industrial oriented companies.\n\nThe offer is $60k/yr ($3k signing bonus) with standard benefits (insurance, PTO, etc.) and the job is located in Raleigh, NC. This seems pretty low for the Raleigh area, but according to some friends it I manageable. Most of my friends who are CS major are incoming SWEs at FAANG companies making 90k+, making me feel like this offer is too low. Additionally, the company seems to have bad Glassdoor reviews (2.0/5) saying that the management/training is bad and hours are long for the salary. However, I also feel like one of by big problems is a lack of formal software engineering experience, which working at this firm for a year or two could help fix. The only fear I have is whether working at this company will pigeonhole me into not being competitive  at companies like FAANG. Is this true (I don't know how common it I for people to hop around companies)?\n\nI am a pretty motivated person who is currently getting into competitive programming, open source development, and learning new frameworks to improve my resume and interview skills. Does anyone have any advice about whether I should take the offer, keep applying, or what?\n\nThanks!",

So...basically, I'm just waiting on current employees to  apply for the job and get rejected? How does that work?\n\nBeing that this is a start-up, I figure they're just working out the kinks...and it hasn't been that long since the last interview.\n\nIs this a common thing that companies do? - offer a position internally for a set number of days prior to offering the position externally? I'm not aware of any laws that mandate this, so I'm wondering if I'm about  to be ghosted, or if this seems legit?\n\nCan anyone clarify on this?",

        "body": "I have a number of thoughts on this issue (down below), but I'm curious of other people's experiences.\n\nIt's not entirely CS-specific, but I do feel like the ratio of luck/networking/talent/etc \\[1\\]. varies by field, and CS has traditionally had a lot of self-taught \"learned to program in my basement for fun\" type of people (I'm one of them), which skews attitudes.\n\nI was reading another post on this sub, [\"I just got a offer for 80k - No Degree\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nl9dxy/i_just_got_a_offer_for_80k_no_degree/), and there was an interesting variety of responses there, so I thought it would be good to address the issue directly, here.\n\nRelevant XKCD: https://xkcd.com/1827/\n\n----\n\nPersonally, I feel like people generally under-estimate the contributions of luck (quite a lot, really), and over-estimate that of hard-work. Especially in the US, there is a prevailing attitude of \"If you work hard, success will come.\" While hard work may be an important, and even necessary ingredient for success \\[2\\], I do not feel like it is generally sufficient.\n\nSo \u2014 not to put too fine a point on it \u2014 when a white male, from a well-to-do background with a good education, living in one of the richest countries on earth tells you \"My hard work paid off, just keep trying and you can be like me,\" it's hard not to roll ones eyes a little at all that conveniently-ignored priviledge. And you get priviledge via luck \u2014 being born into the right body, at the right place and time, etc.\n\nThe unspoken implication of \"If you work hard, success will come\" is that if you are not successful, you must either be lazy or there is something wrong with you. But the reality that I've come to believe is that even though I have worked hard and achieved some success in my field, I feel certain that there are *tons* of people out there that worked just as hard as me (if not more), and did not find that success. Like, thousands upon thousands of people.\n\nThe kicker is that plenty of people really have good intentions by saying such \"motivational\" things. They want to share their success, they want to inspire, they want to provide hope to others. Those aren't bad things. So, it can feel a little harsh to grab someone in that state of mind and try to take them down a peg or two.\n\nWhen I try to discuss these ideas, I'm inevitably met with the response: \"So you're saying people should just give up? If it's all luck, what's the point of trying? That's a bad attitude!\"\n\nAnd at such times I know that I have, sadly, failed to make my point properly. People like binary \"A or B\" explanations for things, but I think there's just too much nuance and grey area, here. Both luck and hard work play a role. Someone who does not work hard is surely more likely to fail. But I'm just saying: someone who *does* work hard is not guaranteed success, either. Plus, hard work doing something you enjoy can be rewarding in itself. I have a whole poker analogy about this set of nuances, but I feel like this post is a bit long, so I'll leave it there.\n\nPlease share your thoughts!\n\n----\n\n[1] I'm generally using the term \"luck\" to refer to a variety of aspects of life that are outside of ones control. Some say \"make your own luck\" or \"put yourself in situations where you are more likely to get lucky\". That is not the luck I'm talking about. That is being shrewd. True luck is outside of your control \u2014 like being born to rich parents.\n\n[2] I'm generally using \"success\" to mean financially. That may be part of this whole problem, though. If people defined \"success\" as \"happiness\" or somesuch, then it might be clearer that someone else's formula for success is not going to be the same as yours, and you should do your own thing and not be swept away by motivational speakers too much :\u00de",

        "body": "So, I have worked in this field in a few jobs now and can now pretty much say that this field has an issue. I have have seen it not just in jobs I have worked but also seen it in posts on here.\n\nSadly too, it appears many in this field were picked on as kids. Not all to be clear. But it seems to be a thing. There is a stereotype after all where some famous person in this field said something along the lines of, \"Be careful of what geek you bully, as they could be your boss one day\". Funny enough, this exact quote semi plays on exactly what I am talking about.\n\nThere is also evidence from studies that many people who were bullied in there past sometimes become bullies themselves. \n\nWell, put two and two together and you get what many are doing in this field. Basically, some people who got picked on as kids (or later in life), who now have some knowledge and a high paying job (aka, they now have some power they didn't have in the past), and are using that power to bully others. \n\nIt seems to play out a lot too with people bullying anyone who they deem \"outsiders\" of this field or who they deem \"lessers\". Many times these people are new to the field and are simply asking basic questions. \n\nThese questions are either met with disdain, dodging (to make the persons life more difficult), or other actions like snitching on them to their boss or gossiping around the office to downtalk that person for just asking questions. For anyone who denies this is a thing, there was actually a post just like this today linked here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nlnjcr/am_i_wrong_in_expecting_help_from_my_new_coworkers/\n\nThere are plenty more examples of posts just like this before people go into denial mode that this isn't a thing.\n\nI think it is about high time this field knocks this off. If you were bullied as a kid, that doesn't give you a right to now bully others in the workforce. \n\nThis field has a lot of potential to be a great thing. But, that means knocking off this toxic behavior of bullying others new to the field or ones asking questions and trying to grow.\n\nI think its time this field stops being in denial about this. It is clear that this field has a problem with the bullied getting some power and now becoming the bullies as adults. \n\nIts time to knock this off. If you were bullied as a kid, you do not have the right to bully others now that you got some power in your life and are taking your anger out on others (that also goes for people who are bullying who weren't bullied as well).",

But I also know that was just the basics of one language and it really gave me no experience in what I'd do working a job in this industry. The problem is throughout my years I've learnt my problem solving skills aren't good, this was seen in my inability to do calculus, any math course, physics without cheating on the whole question. The only reason I even got into the program I wanted too was because I cheated and got the marks. This has been ruining any excitement I had about pursuing computer science. In the contrary, I love courses like social justice, and I was actually able to perform in them. And that's what I was considering doing phycology. The issue is, I don't know what I'm capable of doing. And if I'm going into a competitive field like CS that involves a lot of math, I might not succeed. I understand I could learn it with enough perseverance, but I just have no interest and if I'm already cheating and finding any shortcut possible to do these questions, what will I do in university when I have to repeat these courses. \n\nTLDR; highschool student who sucks at maths, has no interest and cheats on everything doesn't know if this industry is right for a guy like him. Also thinks codes cool and social justice which I don't know have any level ground for a career.",

And yet, I will usually also see a post from this person like \"couldn't crack FAANG interview again, what should I do?\"\n\nAnd to me this is insane, because I have friends that got pretty mediocre grades in their CS classes, maybe completed 100-200 leetcode questions half-heartedly, and were still able to land a FAANG job. So is it really that much harder for international students? I know part of the reason has to do with their visa, and also the tough competition due to the volume of applicants from their countries, all wanting to secure a job in the US.\n\nI'm sure many of you already know this, but I just wanted this to be a reminder.

However, they then tell me you've a 2 hour computer test of which you will be given some sort of scenario and you'll have whole computer with full internet access, you just have to complete those requirements. And If I pass that, then they'll conduct my technical interview. This company I'm talking about is not my dream company, it's just a mid level company. I just have developed one project in 2019 on UWP C# and after that never touched it. I know basics fundamentals of programming that's why I'm able to clear up initial test. But I don't know what should I practice now? What should I look into? They just told me to get a good grasp on OOP and database concepts. I mean, I've like 24, hours till my test, what practice should I do in this time? How can I give my best shot tomorrow? \n\nReally looking forward for some positive response from you guys. \n\nP.S: this is my first post on this subreddit.",

        "body": "Throwaway because I obviously don't want this linking back to my employer.\n\nI'm working at a place on a software project that my gut is telling me is doomed (or, at the very least, more trouble than it's worth). For background, I have 6 years experience in software and a decade in IT before that.\n\nI joined the company a little over a year ago and got put onto Project X after two months. It was presented to me as something of a research project as other developers had attempted to make it work in the past but had failed (I believe Project X was running for at least a year before I joined). I wasn't given any sort of spec, just a vague \"see if you can figure out how this works\".\n\nWithout giving too much away, it needs to connect to and interact with a specialist network, information for which is sparse. Data structures are defined but higher-level documentation on how they tie together, what the expected sequences of events are, etc, is practically non-existent. Unfortunately this means that we don't have any real way of testing it until we connect to the live network (more on that later). There are two main phases, one for each main area of functionality the network provides.\n\nOn the politics side of things, apparently Customer Y had paid the company a hefty sum to build this for them they were extremely unhappy that no tangible progress had been made. Because of this, they were not willing to offer any more assistance or support.\n\nAt the start of Phase 1, we decided to focus on one core area of the network's functionality and after four months, despite the lack of direction and information, I managed to build something that kinda worked (albeit with many, many assumptions made). The CEO then decided to demo it to Customer Y and promised it to them by mid-Q3 this year.\n\nI've become the project lead so I'm getting a lot of pressure to complete it. I've been told it'll \"make or break\" the company, that Customer Y has already started making arrangements to move over so they can't be let down, and that the deadline will **not** be pushed back. However...\n\nWe only finished Phase 1 about a month ago; Phase 2 has barely even been researched. There's still no spec, though new requirements are being thrown at us in passing every day. Every week I'm told it needs to support some business process that was never even mentioned up until now. The CEO is unhappy as he expected Project X to have a fleshed-out UI (he originally insisted it would be integrated with a CRM and so would only need a couple of basic status pages, but he's apparently changed his mind?) so Phase 2 is falling behind while we try to work out what UI is required for Phase 1.\n\nThis isn't even including testing. We don't have access to the live network nor can we find any test network available so we're developing more or less blind. Project X needs to be accredited before it can be used on the live network but nobody can seem to find out who actually does this. Management have told me they expect it to pass accreditation first time.\n\nOn top of all this, we are (unsurprisingly) short-staffed. Until I got a contractor last month I've been running either solo or with one or two people who keep getting swapped out as other emergencies crop up in the company.\n\nEdit: Forgot to say that my current estimates are pushing the dev-complete date well into Q4. Again, not including full testing.",

Always did in high school, but I think they\u2019re basically my favourite courses in school when I compare them to the other courses, so my favourite compared to everything else.\n\nI know engineering is hard, but I feel like if I really like it hopefully i can get trough it. I basically have that mindset of \u201cif you actually love it you can do it\u201d.\n\nAnyways, I have never taken a business course in hs, but i applied to it because I thought finance is interesting, it is math rated and its really tough to succeed and the job\u2019s demanding and so on and on, but i\u2019ve also seen people making lots of money. \n\nComputer science imo is an amazing program and field, and ik its the future of our world.\n\nI\u2019m mostly stuck between business and engineering because I really really wanna be an entrepreneur.\n\nAt least that\u2019s my mindset rn and ik many say that so it might change who knows. I don\u2019t wanna have my own business necessarily in the field of my program. \n\nActually tbh (Im really exposing myself), i really want to TRY having a clothing brand. I wanna see if I\u2019d like that field. \n\nIn hs, i mostly studied and now I wanna change that and explore more. I wanna be able to try fashion and see how i feel about having my own line (ik its super tough but i wanna try).\n\nI basically wanna be able to have time in addition to what I\u2019m studying to explore more and maybe I\u2019ll find something I absolutely love that\u2019s not even related to my program. \n\nIdk if i should do engineering, work super hard for the 6 months of school and I guess do the extra random stuff I wanna do in my own time during summer, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll really have any time considering how hard engineering is.\n\nBut I keep thinking maybe i should study business, giving me a bit more freedom and time because I hear it\u2019s not as rigorous as engineering, and it\u2019s also related to having your own business (you don\u2019t need to have a degree to have your own business but I though it helps).\n\nConsiering all that, rn i feel like i wouldn\u2019t like coding, but i keep thinking what if I\u2019m wrong and i gotta try it out, and maybe I\u2019ll like it and it\u2019s the future of our world so it\u2019s rewarding as well.\n\nSo maybe because I don\u2019t have that \u201comg this is my dream career i really wanna study program x or I really really wanna be an engineer, etc), I should do cs.\n\nMy dad actually says because i\u2019m not strictly interested in business or eng, then i should do the degree with better job prospects. \n\nBut the thing is idk rn at this age, and idk what I\u2019ll like. \n\nI don\u2019t wanna have a desk job forever and I\u2019m fine with having that for awhile and I know all these disciplines are like that, but i think later in my career I wanna have (try my best to have) my own business.\n\nIm so so stuck right now and i would really really incredibly appreciate anyone\u2019s help!! It would mean a lottt to me!! Thank you so so much!\n\nTldr: I am stuck between choosing programs (cs, mech eng, business). I don\u2019t know which one I like. I think wanna be an entrepreneur and perhaps try having my own business (clothing line). But I also like math and physics and the courses of engineering seem interesting. I was quite studious in hs and keep thinking what if eng is for me. At the same time, I missed out on exploring and wanna do that more in uni. What if I find something I love just bc I had more time in business? If I go into business, I\u2019d probably do finance.",

        "body": "After working for a startup for 2+ years as the CTO (from the start) and building the quite extensive REST API backend for a consumer app (among other things), I have decided to start a Master's degree. From the beginning of working there, I have communicated to them that one day I would do that. I told my boss 6 weeks ago (about 4 months before leaving and 2 months before being obliged to tell him) that I was planning to start the degree this year, but said I was interested in continuing to work there part-time. Back then he said that it was quite a short time to find someone else, but accepted it.\n\nHe didn't get back to me for 5 weeks (and apparently didn't do anything about it during that time), so it was me who asked for a meeting about 1 week ago to discuss the details of the part-time engagement. Turns out we had very different expectations of how much work I was going to do - I was planning to focus on the degree and thus only work there for 8h/week (at least for a couple months, and then probably leave once a new opportunity comes along), he was expecting 20h/week + more outside the lecture periods. I told him I didn't want to work that much to focus on the degree, he argued that a financing round was planned for this fall and without a \"real\" CTO he had a hard time raising funds, and without funds he had a hard time finding a new CTO and thus had a huge problem. It seemed like he was making me feel as though this was my fault now and giving me a bad conscience about it. This stirred me up a bit and I started to look for alternatives what to do instead working there part-time during my degree (e.g., freelancing). We decided to talk about it again 1 week later.\n\nThinking more about this and finding the alternatives much more attractive and more valuable in terms of my career, I decided I didn't want to work there anymore long-term for different reasons. So I told him today in our meeting that it was my plan to leave the company in 3 months instead of continuing to work there part-time as originally planned. He was staggered and told me he was very disappointed and me not wanting to work there for a couple more weeks/months (part-time) could now cost everyone their job (because of them not getting new funding this way). He made me feel guilty of letting the team down.\n\nWhile I am still sure this is the right decision for me and my career and I don't think I have done anything wrong (feel free to convince me otherwise), I'm still feeling bad about the possibility that me leaving might actually negatively affect the jobs of my team mates (as I have an essential role in the company, both operationally and (apparently) for getting funding).   \n\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on it!",

They look great on the surface, but my concern is that the time commitment can be quite large (anywhere between 16 months and 3 years) and it's hard to really pin down how good they are, how much I will actually learn and if they are better than self studying.  \n\nThe benefits I see from them are that I'll be getting paid (although, not much, but tha'ts fine for a couple years), getting a foot in the door in working in a professional IT environment, learning on the job and meeting people. \n\nMy gut feeling is that these apprenticeships will vary wildly in quality, it will be important to go the extra mile in order to learn the most and it's about finding and employer that is interested in helping someone grow instead of just having someone to make coffees etc. \n\nI'm open to any advice, or any learning resources anyone is willing to share!  \n\n\nThanks for taking your time to read my post!",

What should I get done by the end of the first day? What should I learn/figure out/understand ASAP? \n\nAlso, is it a good idea to reach out to everyone on my team to ask for a 15-min intro call? Or would that be a disturbance to the real devs?\n\nActually, while we\u2019re at it (sorry if too many questions all at once), what\u2019s a good pace to be communicating/checking in with my manager, especially since everything is virtual? \n\nReally appreciate any advice, especially from those who have managed interns before.

        "title": "For any mid-level developers stuck in an underpaid and overpaid job - Go out and start applying. Now.",
        "body": "Hey all,\n\nI recently made a post about interviewing for a new position that is 2-3x my current salary and finally got the offer. I'm ecstatic about the position, but have been thinking lately about how much I've been shafted over the years at my current position. I love the people, but the pay has been very subpar(\\~50k in one of the highest COL areas in the country) and the work is mostly brochure sites and small fixes on top of convoluted CMS's. \n\nThe job was very comfy; my co-workers and boss were very very cool, relaxed atmosphere but at the same time learning where I needed to as it is a very small company (\\~5 employees, sole developer). I was there for almost 5 years as my first dev job out of school, so I learned a majority of what I know by being tasked with everything from UI design to full-stack development. Besides the pay, it was so easy-going that I delayed my job search by probably a year or two late, even though I knew I would be able to get payed over double what I was currently making at my next position.\n\nI eventually had a breaking point when the project management and general structure of some of the projects I leaded development on began to fall apart and began applying for positions in the area. After talking with some friends and colleagues, they advised that It was time for me to look for another position and that I was being poorly compensated for such a valuable skill set.\n\nI got in touch with a recruiter that reached out on LinkedIn, and was given an offer at a publicly traded e-commerce brand as the first company I interviewed within almost half a decade. I am generally a very poor interviewee, so much of this was probably luck; however, depending on your location, I think that there is a large demand for SWE's and developers than most think.\n\nAs I mentioned, the job is not only working on a very interesting and well-known platform, it also pays almost 3 times my current salary. \n\nWanted to make this post to give some motivation to any junior/mid-level developers who are contemplating leaving their long-term position for elsewhere. If you enjoy the company and the company has a reasonable path to upward mobility, then staying at your current employer may be a smart move. But most developers with <5 years experience seem to be at small agency/product teams that are prone to stagnation when it comes to salary and position advancement. Don't be scared to open yourself to opportunities. Even if you don't yet feel ready to move on, you can at least get a better understanding of your local market for your skillset and get some experience interviewing. It definitely surprised me what my local market was offering for development positions in regards to salary, and I'm excited to move on to the next stage of my career and learn a whole new set of skills that I wasn't accustomed to in my last position.\n\nTLDR; If you are at a mid-level developer who is unhappy with either the work they are doing or the salary they are receiving, move on and upward.",

        "body": "I've been an intern in SWE and ML in a pretty big company for a few months now (not in the US). This internship is supposed to be the last one I do before I graduate, and the grade the uni jury and my manager will give to my internship report counts as half my final grade this year. \n\nThe problem is that my internship isn't going as well as I planned. I am working within a team of SWEs but on a separate project, which is in my opinion way too ambitious to be completed by an intern in just a few months. \n\nIt is roughly about building an entire system which will use a ML model I had to find on my own, and that will be used as an internal tool by developers at the company, with no data available to train the model. I came up with several ideas for a model since I've been here, the team let me demonstrate how I could use them to solve the problem and every time they said that the model was not going to be precise enough, fast enough, etc. I spoke to different people working in ML and they said that it was a known difficult subject even among researchers and more likely to be completed by a PhD student in a few years. Actually, three other interns have been working on this subject before me and they all failed apparently. \n\nI am starting to feel really anxious about the outcome of this internship, and every morning I wake up with the stressful thought that I will not be able to graduate because I am too incompetent for this. \n\nIs there still a chance to save my internship even if I do not finish the product they expected me to build?",

        "title": "CS degree, no internships, looking for a job and am on the fence about App Academy bootcamp",
        "body": "I graduated last December with a BS in computer science and a minor in math, with a 3.34 gpa.\n\nI never had an internship during college, and I\u2019m looking for my first job in the software development industry. I\u2019m in the application process for App Academy for a 4 month long intensive bootcamp online, which covers Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, SQL, and a lot of other things to prepare me to be a full stack web developer.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m considering App Academy is because I seriously dread the job search and application process, and I hate long wait times and rejections to be honest. So by doing an intensive bootcamp, I\u2019m making myself the most qualified I have ever been. I\u2019ll have more skills in my resume under skills I\u2019m \u201cproficient\u201d in and more skills in general. I\u2019ll have new projects which could hopefully be better than my previous projects, and on top of that, they offer career services like 1:1 career coaching, mock interviews, and resume reviews and stuff. I\u2019ll have group project experience, which I feel also helps make up for not having an internship. So I think it will take me less applications to get my job after a bootcamp, and I can hopefully shorten the job search process and minimize rejections. That\u2019s why I\u2019m considering it. I really just want to \u201cget my foot in the door\u201d but without a painful process. I kinda enjoy learning new computer science stuff anyways. I\u2019ll look forward to learning (in depth, not just basics) Ruby, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and SQL. The rest, hopefully I enjoy and I think I probably will. \n\nAt this point, 4 months are gonna pass by quick anyways, so I\u2019d rather be more qualified in 4 months than possibly be still unemployed or lost. And the thing I fear most is a large amount of time passing by, like 4 months, and me regretting not joining App Academy from the start (especially because this is the last online cohort before they switch back to San Francisco and New York cohorts.) So I\u2019d rather just get this over with, study for 4 months (I guess it will just be like one more university semester), and put myself in the best position to get hired.\n\nOne thing is their job placement rate though. This is one thing that made me uneasy about the program, because though they say they have around a 93% placement rate, my counselor said 6 months is the average time to get placed, and in an information session they said that 50% get placed within 6 months after the program. So while I do have a big advantage because of my degree, and I also have decent knowledge of and practice with  technical interviews, and at least a few projects already, I don\u2019t want to struggle for months after an already intensive program. If any App Academy graduates have information on how long it took to get a job and roughly how many applications were sent, I would appreciate that information very much.",

        "title": "Advice for dealing with a cowboy coder team lead who keeps breaking things",
        "body": "**Tl;dr: Team lead who I do not directly report to went behind my back and pushed changes he thought were the right ones to make, literally hours after I finished my work and after saying he was ok with what I was doing. This directly broke my shit and he did it all without telling anyone and skirting our Agile review process. He has a history of doing this, but I am unsure of how to bring the obvious security and process concerns up to our team since he's in a position of power and there is a non-zero chance this comes back to bite me. Could use some advice.**\n\nFirst off, apologies. This is going to be lengthy because I don't want to miss any details.\n\n**The Situation:**\n\nI joined a healthcare startup a few months ago as a primarily front-end dev. While it's been mostly great so far, the last week has brought up some concerns that I'm not too sure how to approach bringing to the team. Namely, it's been made pretty apparent to me that one of our two team leads is a cowboy coder extraordinaire. Let's call him Fred.\n\nFor context, we're an Agile/Scrum team. Nothing out of the ordinary aside from our three week sprints.\n\nThis all started last week. After going back and forth on an endpoint I was assigned that sends out bulk emails, I realized that the older code I was trying to integrate with wasn't going to handle this use case with any sort of reasonable performance at scale. Our back-end is mostly [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) that integrates with plenty of Azure services, and while I've had experience in C# in the past, the framework is totally new to me. So naturally, I've been reading and bouncing ideas off of devs that are more knowledgeable with it when I hit a dead end. Knowing that we have a new service built by Fred that should handle this better, I go and ask him about it.\n\nAll seemed well, got the service up and running and I start playing with it. After a bit I start to realize that, while it is a better system, the way Fred integrated it into our main backend project makes it so that it's more focused on sending single emails than it is for bulk. No worries, I start playing around with some different methods of achieving this while also trying to think of how to optimize for a reasonable scale. I get some rough data through local testing and have one method that stands out as significantly faster than anything else. But I still want to make sure I'm not missing something, so I take it to Fred to get his thoughts.\n\nImmediately he gets defensive about changing anything at all. Asks what the value of it is and how he doesn't think that the request times I see locally will be at all what we see in production. Which he's not wrong about, sure, but I wasn't trying to say the specific times I was seeing locally were going to be the same for a production build out in the cloud whatsoever. I was asking about the general and consistent trends that I was seeing between the different approaches I tested. Eventually it seemed like he backed down and told me to do it if I felt strongly about it.\n\nSo I make the changes and put up a pull request. The only big comment I receive is from another senior backend dev who just suggests a change in the mechanism I was using to do what I had discussed with Fred, which I happily did. The PR sat there for a few hours after that with no other activity..... until Fred comes bursting in with this essay of a comment, adamantly telling me to remove the change I had made and use the existing code he had written. He again asked what the value of it was and specifically demanded I show him the data to prove what I was claiming about my changes.\n\nI'm frustrated, but try to remain diplomatic, push back with the data again and reiterate exactly what it is I'm trying to do and why. At this point, this is also starting to block other people who have related tickets from being able to do their work, as well as testing the entire feature. So in the interest of not holding other people up, I tell him I can also just revert the changes I've made to do it his way, test in production to verify the trends I was seeing and optimize from there.\n\nThe next morning, I'm confused af when he suddenly backs down again and tells the entire team during stand up that his PR comments are never meant to block unless he specifically says so or makes himself a required reviewer when I mention I wanted to discuss it. Fine, whatever. I get approval and push the changes.\n\nFast forward to around midnight, just before I'm about to head to bed. I go to do a quick test of the changes to make sure they're working for our QA in the morning. Of course, they're suddenly broken. I get a funny feeling and go right to the place where my changes overlapped with his prior integration with his service. Lo and behold, Fred had pushed changes on top of mine about three hours before I checked, without PRing or telling anyone, that were the direct reason for this breaking.\n\nQA asks about it next morning when they run into the broken endpoint, but thankfully I'm ready for it and just say that changes were pushed late the night before that broke things, without calling out Fred specifically to avoid singling him out. Still, he responds to our Slack thread, saying all this stuff about how he was totally rethinking the service anyway to accommodate bulk emails, that it would do away with the need for my changes and that he would tell me when all these updates were done and pushed. Stand up rolls around and he also says that he'll fix what he broke with my changes, but goes off on a tangent repeating the same stuff he said on Slack. He does end up fixing my shit though.\n\n**The Concerns:**\n\nSo yeah... all kinds of questions come out of this. I also got confirmation from both one of our testers and a more junior dev who has been here for a longer time and is a direct report of Fred's (I report to someone else on the same team) that this is far from the first time this has happened. People have been cleaning up the messes he's left behind for a while, apparently.\n\nThere's certainly a personal aspect to it for me, since he basically went behind my back to do this instead of discussing it in the appropriate forum like a professional. But it also makes me question whether he trusts the rest of our team in general, since I'm not the only one he's done this to, and his ability to be a decent leader and mentor for our more junior devs. After all, if Fred, who basically is the most powerful member of our team when it comes to permissions and privileges, isn't following our rules, why should anyone else?\n\nThe biggest issue to me though, and what I'm truly worried about, is the possibility of him introducing something catastrophic into the codebase that nobody catches until it's too late. While we're still a relatively early stage startup, we're in the healthcare space and deal directly with our clients' personal medical information. There's a lot that could go wrong here and this is an easy way for it to happen, in my opinion. I know I'm also not alone in this opinion on my team.\n\n**The Approach:**\n\nAll that being said, I'm unsure of how to approach this and could use some advice. Besides the obvious thing of him being in a position of power, even if I'm not his direct report, Fred is also the primary admin for all of our repos, Azure services, databases etc. and has the most seniority of anyone on our team. He's technically capable and has helped drive a lot of the design of our system. As far as I know, he's also got at least a decent rep in the company. There is a non-zero chance this could backfire on me.\n\nI don't want to turn this into a crusade or turn Fred into a boogeyman either. Generally speaking, I like him as a person and there could be more to his side of the story. \n\nBut this needs to stop for the health of our team, codebase and, ultimately, the company.\n\nMy initial thought is to start gauging how the rest of the team feels; kind of a \"start small and escalate as necessary\" sort of thing. I had a long conversation with the two people who confirmed his history and they also feel the same way. I have a 1-on-1 with my manager this week and I've been thinking of talking to him about it as well. \n\nOf course, if we end up bringing this up to Fred as a team, my hope is he accepts it and starts to change. I just want to be prepared in case he doesn't and try and cover my own ass as much as I can.\n\nIf you were in this situation, or have been, how would you handle it?",

The pay is decent, there is much flexibility, I get to work remotely which is awesome. However, the codebase I have to work with is awfully messy and poorly written. Even the unit tests are incredibly messy and difficult to maintain! Things break frequently. \n\nThe \u201csenior\u201d engineers who had worked on this had all left before I joined over 2 years ago. I inherited a team where everyone is mostly inexperience despite their fanciful titles except for one person whom I have recently recruited. But everyone is very passive and full of air. So I\u2019ve much babysitting and ego soothing to do for them. \n\nAnd here\u2019s the biggest problem. I\u2019m the lead of the team and I\u2019m responsible for \u201cmaking things right.\u201d But, I have lost all motivation to \u201ccorrect\u201d the mess. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve been with the company for over 2 years and I did try and I was literally working 60 hours a week in the first year ambitiously refactoring and rewriting parts of the mess whenever I work on a new story. I hope I was going to gradually do this for the whole application but I eventually felt extremely mentally taxing and fatigue. I was the only one. Nobody on the team is interested in doing this. They just build their feature requests by the PM and call it a day. And nobody seriously appreciated it anyway because they either don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on or it looks functionally the same to them before the refactor. Delegating to the rest of the engineers isn\u2019t helping too as they are either inexperience or not interested.\n\nI see everyone else on the team just cruising by the days. They either do some low hanging tasks or takes a long time to slowly complete a task. I wish I could do the same too but I can\u2019t because I\u2019m the lead and I\u2019m held responsible for any mess or lack of improvements and my boss has expectations of me. I\u2019ve a small side hustle and I enjoy building my own stuff than working extra hours in a job. I wish I could also cruise by the days like the others on the team and focus more on my own project. \n\nRecently, I\u2019m trying to do just \u201cenough\u201d to get by and nothing more than 8 hours a day. But the progress of the tasks are slow and the messy codebase is piling up. It\u2019s a matter of time I\u2019ve to answer to this. \n\nShould I consider changing job because of these reasons? I love the remote work and flexibility as I can have more time for my side hustle. I\u2019m afraid I may lose these in a new job. But I\u2019m also so sick of being responsible for a messy codebase and babysitting a bunch of passive noobs. I wonder my coding skills would even degrade working with that mess after a long enough time. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure what I should do and would love to hear some opinions and suggestions about my situation.",

        "body": "Hey y'all, throwaway to prevent too much personal identifiers. So since about 5 years ago I've been sporadically pursuing a job in CS. I went to a coding bootcamp, and I'm currently in my sophomore year for a Comp Sci degree. In the meantime I've had other jobs to keep me afloat. I've always been more proficient with tech than the average user (re: know how to google problems). Long story short, a company offered me a job as a DBA. Specifically, cleaning up a very disorganized database, and automating some aspects of the other positions to free up employees for other tasks. I'm familiar with the software the company uses to create orders, invoices, track accounts, etc. It's essentially a glorified SQL GUI with some automated report functions.\n\nMy problem is that when the company ordered this software, it was essentially a new product with zero previous users. As far as I know, we are still the only company using this version of the software. When my company first started using it, there was a lot of back and forth between them and the providers to cover specific edge cases that evolved it to the point where only a select few of the customer service team at the provider could even understand our questions about the product and help, as well as a small group of people at my company who knew what to ask. Those people have since left both companies, so while I know how to use the front-end from experience and have a pretty good picture in my head of the back-end, I can't get any straight answers on it.\n\nMy access so far has been very limited, being forced to manually correct these problems through the front-end. Even this doesn't provide enough for me to fully do my job, as certain fields (containing seemingly inconsequential data) require me to contact the provider to get filled in. I also have to contact them to have any entries deleted. On top of that, any changes I make have to account for integration they built with multiple other pieces of software we use. I have to submit all of my questions about how the software handles certain cases as support tickets. Half of these tickets to the provider are answered incorrectly (determined from experience and basic experimentation with test entries), the other half go unanswered. I have no legitimate documentation on the software or how the integrations work, so I can't know what changes I make could have negative consequences without a slow testing process. \n\nI have some other responsibilities that keep me busy and my employer isn't expecting changes overnight, but I feel like I could progress faster with more access, either to the database itself (as my job implied I would get), the documentation, or at the very least someone who knows how it works.

Everything was fine, my boss was satisfied with my work to the point that he offered me a job within 2 months and promised a work contract at the end of April.\nThe thing is during that time, I had exams so I wasn't able to move to another city ( where the agency is located) I told my boss and he was okay with it. He told me to start working right away but I won't sign the contract until I get there and we agreed on the terms of the contract. Now it's been two days since I moved in, and he suddenly changed his mind claiming that he's giving me another 3 months  internship period because legally he has the right to renew my contract whenever he wants to and after that, I will officially sign the contract. I don't understand am I being played?\nPs: this is my first job ever and I got lucky getting it because I still have one year to get my master degree.\nP. S: I live in Morocco. I checked the work code \"code de travail\" and there was no law that obligate employers that.",

Associate Product Manager at a well-funded tech startup (100 people)\n2. Software Engineer 1 position at Large Ecommerce Company with 2-day shipping.\n\nIt has been a long time goal of mine to become a Product Manager, and to eventually start my own tech startup.\n\nInitially, my plan was to work \\~2 years as a software engineer at a large tech company to build a solid foundation in technical skills, then transition to a PM role to gain the mini-ceo experience, and eventually pursue the startup route. The opportunity to be a Associate Product Manager sprung up within my connections, and I applied without any expectations. Now I am conflicted because I haven't considered being a PM so soon, and I was expecting to take things step by step and develop engineering skills first before moving into PM. Which opportunity should I pursue? While I will immediately start accumulating PM experience as a APM in the startup space (both of which I want to pursue in the future), I am also worried that I will miss out on the foundations of being a good developer that might set me up well for the future.\n\nAny advice appreciated!

        "body": "Hello to anyone willing to open this up!\nThis is a slightly stacked question, so feel free to share any insight you might feel would be relevant.\nI am inspiring to develop a practical computer skill. \nI have two topics of interest that I am struggling to decide on what topic I should focus on the most.\n\nThe first set of skills I was looking into developing was learning how to do full stacked web development I've heard that they're quite a few individuals who have successfully made a comfortable income in this field with no traditional higher education or even without the help of a bootcamp program. I personally have been dabbling in the field taking the Colt Steele Web Development course on Udemy, as well as a Zero to Hero Python Course taught by Jose Portilla. I have been enjoying the courses so far even though I do feel a little intimidated in the web development field just knowing how it is a continuously evolving field and I'm aware it will require me to have a dedication to learning the new systems that come and play as they develop.\nIt is a little scary but I do find fulfillment in the process of writing out the code and seeing it perform appropriately.\njust a lot to take in. \n\nThen while I was doing some research I came across the cybersecurity field. Which definitely does peak my interest a bit. What also peaks my interest is how there's a economy claim that there's already more cyber security work out there than there are people capable of doing the work and I came across a statistic that showed that it's supposed to only get in more demand as time progresses. Only thing is is that I have yet to have met or communicated with anybody who has gone into cybersecurity independently without traditional higher education. So I am unaware of how accepting companies   are with people who have learn the skills themselves.\nI've read some career guides in the field stating that if you are interested in learning and starting a career in cyber security the best start is to go get your CompTIA A+ core 1 & 2 certifications and then obtain the Security+, \nAnd then a Network+ and a Cloud+ certification along with some showable projects to prove capabilities.\n\nSo I am struggling with deciding which path should I focus the most. \nI currently have two weeks off before I start a new job as a call center representative. Which I'm very excited about considering I've been doing logistics, warehouse grunt work for about 7 years of my life.\nOne of the possible opportunities I'm considering since I'm heading to a call center is possibly looking into getting my certifications CompTIA A+ core 1 & 2 to see if I could move myself up into the IT department at the call center. \n\nI've always had a love for computers and grew up on a computer playing around on my own desktop at 9 years old. Even started learning HTML at that age on neopets.com. I never considered until I got older and wiser about developing that passion for the technology into something that could help me achieve greater things.\n\nSo my main questions are,\nDo you or anyone you know independently learned any of these skills that I am talking about?\nHow did they organize there studies?\n (I for example am trying out the Pomodoro technique with a productivity tracker) \n\nMy dream is digital nomadacy. I want to be able to work remotely as long as I have a solid computer and internet connection. Do you know anybody who has achieved this and if so what skills did they develop to make it happen?\n\nShould I maintain a focus to get my certifications instead of dedicating to completing my python course due to the fact that where I am currently heading professionally has a IT department and with the appropriate certifications could boost my resume to obtain a promotion from where I'm currently heading? \nOr should I organize my time to where I study both topics of interest?\n\nThe trick here is that I have a wife and kids and can realistically only dedicate about 20 hours to 25 hours a week maximum of studying.\n\nThese are the questions that have been fogging my brain and focus.\nAny suggestions or advice will be gratefully appreciated!",

        "title": "When should you jump to a leadership role?",
        "body": "Hi, I'm a software engineer with a little over three years of experience.\n\nI've been recently thinking about leadership and whether I should try to start pursuing a leadership role or not.\n\nI remember a professor I had in college, who was also a software engineer with national reputation, once saying that before jumping to a leadership role (be it manager, team lead, CTO...) one should gain proper experience. He recommended doing technical stuff (i.e. being a regular software engineer) for 10 years before considering any leadership role. He made it clear how important it is to learn as much as possible before becoming, for instance, a manager. That made a lot of sense to me, so I've been trying to keep that in mind during these past three years. My main priority has been (and still is) to learn as much as I can.\n\nBut the key here is that in my previous company I started to gain \"management awareness\", if that's a thing (hope it doesn't sound too cringy). I was aware of how my manager was behaving and why, or how would've I done things differently (not necessarily better). Also, at that company I became like the go-to person. In addition to the regular development stuff, I would also help people, train new developers, make technical decisions and overall make sure that no one was blocked.\n\nThen I moved on to my current company, where something similar has happened. I've gained some ownership of some projects over the past months and somehow I'm the go-to dev again. The biggest difference in this company is that we have a good team lead so he's the one managing and leading the team, but still he relies a lot on me when a decision needs to be made. He always asks for my opinion, whether it's about a technical problem or about a candidate who's in the interview process. Also when our team lead is out, I'm the one attending meetings, managing stakeholder communication and whatever my team lead would do. I didn't explicitly ask for those \"responsibilities\", but I guess I naturally gravitated towards it and everyone seems happy with the situation.\n\nSo, I find myself starting to have this leadership way of thinking. And don't get me wrong, I'm not referring to leadership as being the fascist micromanager who tells others what to do. I'm talking about it more in terms of helping the team, providing proper training to co-workers who need it, and all of that.\n\nWhat I like the most about this field is the tech part. I love solving problems with technology. I don't see myself being a \"pure\" manager who has completely abandoned coding. However, I like this leading by example thing. Also I've been gaining some interest on agile management lately. So, the possibility of starting to pursue a leadership role is definitely something that has been sticking around my head for some weeks but I'm full of doubts. My biggest fear is abandoning programming too early on my career and regretting it in the future.\n\nWhat has been your experience with leadership roles? When did you make the jump? Was it worth it? Is it easy to be in a leadership role but still be able to solve interesting problems and write some code?\n\nThanks for reading!",

        "body": "Hi all, first time poster here!\n\nI graduated in Math and CS in 2020 and got a job as a Product Specialist last September at a growing tech company (4000+ employees) . Let's call it Company A. The Product Specialist role offered promotion tracks into various Engineering positions (Test Engineering and Support Engineering), but I realized that I have do have the appropriate skillset to land an actual Software Engineering position. My ultimate goal is to become a Software Engineer.\n\nMy manager found a loophole to allow me to promote to a Development role within Company A. The position will pay about $70-80k. It's on the low end since I am an internal hire, but if I stick with Company A for a bit I can work through and get promotions to where I'll get paid a higher salary, as well as have opportunities for leadership in a growing and successful tech company. It's not Software Engineering, but from what I understand, in general Developers have the ability to become Engineers by amassing time and experience.\n\nOn the other hand, I also got an offer from Company B to join a growing team at a large food chain to work on one of their backend APIs as an SDET. From what I understand, they are looking for fresh college graduates so they can train and groom them to become leaders and valuable parts of their growing team (12 team members to 130 team members since 2020). The hiring manager said their most recent SDET became a QA lead in 6 months. I realize this is not a guaranteed track, but there seems to be signs of major career development there in QA. Additionally, the offer is $110k.\n\nHere are the pros/cons of each of the positions\n\n**Company A:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Large tech company with name recognition\n* Lots of ability for career growth in multiple directions\n* More interesting work and mobility (I would prefer not to specialize in QA Engineering)\n* I like the people in my company a lot. I have a lot friends here, there are a lot of young people, and there is a regular influx of college graduates\n\nCons:\n\n* Pay is not great and will remain this way for awhile. Company A is somewhat notorious for not compensating internal hires enough.\n* Slow path for promotion and leadership opportunities\n* It is a Development role vs. Engineering role\n\n**Company B:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Much higher salary\n* Fast track for promotion and leadership opportunities\n* Smaller team means that I can become an extremely valuable asset to the team\n* Ability to become a QA lead fairly quickly\n* It has aspects of an Engineering role\n\nCons:\n\n* Less name recognition in the tech space\n* Less interesting work (I am interested, but not *too* interested in QA)\n* Permanent remote work and the team seems to lean towards the older side\n\nIf any of you have been in a similar situation, please let me know how you dealt with it. I feel like I'm between two great opportunities and would like some input as to how you dealt with the decision-making process, as well as how that decision ended up panning out for you.",

        "body": "I've recently moved to a new project. Using lots of aws serverless. Pretty much all new to me. Never had any training.\nI asked to move project because I was getting burnt out on my last one. The previous one was so big we had to fight management for work (for some ideal, not for me). They'd prioritise predictability over efficient use of Devs. I'd spend half my sprint waiting for the next one. Doing dull mindless tasks in between. It wasnt for me. As someone who's been a Dev for 3 years I need experience and I felt my skills deteriorated while I was there. I'd get a decent chunk of code to work on around once every 3 months. It was ridiculous.\n\nBack to now my current project is very dull. We don't do anything apart from move from lambda to queue to lambda to fargate. Not only am I widely inexperienced to do this, I'm not being offered specific training and I'm constantly getting pressured by my tech lead that things are taking too long. And I'm constantly have to waste my team's time asking for help. I feel lost and constantly stuck. I hate the fact I'm counting down the minutes till finishing time. On a previous project where I'd worked on data problems I'd love going in every day. I'd even love it even though I had 3 hours a day travelling. I do this role from home and it feels like a longer day.\n\nAfter joining this project it was clear to me Id enjoyed previous projects more due to a data focus. So now I'm in the process of changing over to a data engineering role (and then hopefully a DS in future). Within my company. That sector seem to offer more consistent training. They've even doing training for me right now for those wanting to make the move from software to data.\n\nHowever, in the meantime I feel almost stuck in my current role. I keep getting told how great it will be to understand AWS in future and this project is only until September. Is it worth sticking it out? Found myself stressed and exhausted constantly since starting this project a month and a half ago. Always feel inadequate and it takes me 4 weeks to do a ticket which I know a teammate can do in a couple days. It makes me embarrassed and like I'm not cut out for this. When I know full well in the past how good I have been at my job.\n\nShould I stick it out for the remaining 4 months? Should I ask to be moved to a data focused project or will this look bad on my company and be unfair on my team? Is this a sign I'm not good enough to be a programmer? Any general advice would be so helpful. I feel so stuck.",

        "body": "I\u2019m in a bit of a tough spot. I\u2019m a Software Developer with 2 years of experience. I currently really like my work, but I\u2019m underpaid. On top of that the opportunity is likely ending in a year. The opportunity has great work life balance.\n\nI just finished a final round interview at company X that went really well. I believe they might come with an offer that is over 2x (double) my current comp and fully remote. I really like their process, values, and everyone I\u2019ve met was friendly. A rare interview with no red flags. However, looking into company X almost all their recent employee reviews on Glassdoor are negative with a fairly common trend: \u201cThe company is going down hill\u201d. Last year they laid off about 7% of their workforce. It seems like maybe a lot of that was in sales, but I couldn\u2019t find out for sure. I haven\u2019t had much success with other interviews so I was feeling really excited about this, but now I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nCompany X is a global, publicly traded company with around 600-700 engineers. Their growth does appear to be stagnating, and their stock has been declining a few percentage points this year.\n\nMy question is: How do you adequately assess the stability of a company like that? Are the layoffs a red flag or business as usual especially with COVID? Is frequent \u201crestructuring\u201d a red flag?",

Slowly overtime impostor syndrome started to set in and now every time I start to apply again, I take breaks here and there for mental health (being constantly ignored or rejected isn't exactly great for it after all), I find myself think \"no I can't do that\" or \"no I'm not qualified for that\" or \"I only have 1 thing out of the 10 that they want, why try\".\n\nI try and work on projects on my own, for both something to do and something to put on my resume, but I feel like I burnt out on them faster and faster.

I do have this habit of once I figure something out, I think nothing of it. Like I'll look back at projects as just things I did instead of accomplishments, like I published an app on the play store but anytime someone asks about it I tend to play it down as \"just a simple weather app\".

This may sound convoluted, but the title of the degree that I have been pursuing is as follows: \"Applied Computer Science: Web and Mobile Application Development with a focus in Security\"\n\nI have decided that I am going to move back to the east coast to be closer to my family, and luckily OSU has a fairly prolific online degree program that will allow me to finish my studies on the other side of the country. The one caveat to this is that they do not offer Web and Mobile Application Development purely through online classes; they only offer CyberSecurity and some kind of CS/Business hybrid which I am not interested in.\n\nI AM interested in CyberSecurity (hence the \"focus\" part of my original degree) but I know very very little about it compared to traditional programming/SWE. Ironically, a family friend is the CISO at a large Fortune 50 company which is headquartered in the city I am moving to, so career wise it seems like it could be a very good move.\n\nMy main question is this: **Would it be possible to apply for traditional SWE jobs if I don't like cybersecurity?** I am thinking I could just list my degree as \"Applied Computer Science\" and just leave off the \"CyberSecurity\" part, but having never held a job in the industry I am not sure whether this would fly. I would love to hear any thoughts that you have regarding the situation, and if any of you are Security people I would love some online resources to learn more about the field.  \n\n\nTLDR - Could a CS graduate whose degree says Cybersecurity get a Dev job?",

Though I know it's very difficult to get an internship as a freshman, my position is a bit unique: as a result of all the university credit I got from my AP and IB exams, I'm entering university as a second-year student, and as such, I'm unsure of whether companies would treat me as a freshman or as a sophomore.\n\nFurther, how important is this distinction? Is the lack of freshman internships a result of freshmen generally being less qualified, or do companies actively prefer sophomores and juniors because they're closer to finishing their degree? For a bit of context, I don't have *zero* experience, but I'm not super skilled or anything; I've done a paid CS research internship at a university and have a few personal projects.\n\nIn summary: I'm starting university this year, but graduating in 2024.

        "title": "I finally got an offer! (2020 new grad w/ no internships)",
        "body": "Hey guys this is my obligatory I got an offer post! I've been lurking this sub ever since I graduated last summer and wasn't having any success during my post grad job search. I applied to close to 500 job listings in my initial job search, which lasted a couple months. I had a handful of interviews, and ultimately made it to the final round with two companies (at different times). I posted about them before on this sub but basically I felt I did pretty well for both companies, but both times the recruiter would ghost me at some point after the final interview without giving me a solid answer. Then 2 weeks later they would send me a rejection email that told me they went with someone with more experience. This left me feeling so defeated, especially since having no internships made me a lot less competitive as a candidate, and it was difficult to get to the final round. Finally around December I got an offer at a notorious WITCH company, but I decided to just go for it since it wasn't contract based and I could still continue to apply on the job.\n\nLuckily the training at the WITCH company taught me a couple of new technologies, which I immediately added to my resume. Then after a few months I started my second round of job search, and this time I had a lot more callbacks for interviews! I think having a few months of \"experience\" at a company even if it was a WITCH helped me significantly in my job search. This time I was interviewing for companies left and right, even though I only submitted about 85 applications. Eventually I got to the final round with 2 companies, and both times I again felt I did pretty good. The first company took a week to get back to me after the final round and lo and behold they decided to go with a more experienced candidate. The second company gave me an offer the same day as the final interview! I still had interviews lined up with other companies at this point, but I was pretty tired of interviewing in general so I didn't continue with those applications.\n\nSo the moral of the story, for me at least, is to take a job even if it may be a WITCH, especially if you are able to leave and it's not contract based. The new technologies and skills I gained there were pretty invaluable to my own job search. Of course I'm not trying to tell you to join a WITCH if you have to sign away 2 years of your life, however if you manage to get an offer that's less than ideal but you can leave at any time and still keep job searching I'd say go for it. At the end of the day having any amount of relevant experience, however minimal, may still be better than having no experience at all.\n\nSome other things worth mentioning about my story is that I did probably only around 20 leetcode questions, mostly easys and mediums. Any time I was given an online assessment, even if I did well and completed all the questions and passed all the tests, none of them ever got back to me. I did a couple of take home projects too, and I felt that although I initally preferred those to leetcode, I found that doing well enough to pass to the next round was a lot harder than just doing straight up leetcode interviews. Another thing that may have helped me is that I switched from applying on LinkedIn to Indeed, which is where I found success.\n\nEdit: Wow I didn't expect this to blow up, thanks for the awards! I'll add a tldr.\n\nTldr: I couldn't find a job post grad and so after 500 applications I decided to take a WITCH job and keep searching. It panned out and my experience at the WITCH job helped me get a real job offer elsewhere.",

        "body": "I'm currently living in the US, have completed my masters, and 1.5 years of work on my OPT(Not sure how much this would be valuable in other countries). I'm kind of worried as I'm out of 2 chances for my H1B in the lottery and I want to think of what to do in case I do not get through the lottery next year, and wanted to start planning. I'm also kind of unsatisfied with my life in the states, and would like to move somewhere better.\n\nHere are the factors I'm considering as very important:\n\n1. Ease and guarantee of a visa/permanent residency : So I'm in a lottery for the H1B, and then a lottery for the green card is kind of frustrating. I would really like some measure of stability(Work visa as long as you are employed, and permanent residence/citizenship after staying for X years) so I can start planning a future(purchase a house/get a good car etc.).\n2. A good healthcare system : Right now I'm perfectly fine, but no-one can predict the future(especially after retirement) I also know that my family has a history of diabetes, and while it would be best for me that I don't get it, realistically I will. I'd rather not spend a fortune on staying alive.\n3. A good work-life balance : Right now I don't have a family and can totally dedicate a lot more time to work, but I eventually plan on having one. I would really love a solid paternity leave, more than 11 holidays a year, and being able to stop work at 5.\n4. A good public transport system : I can drive, but I don't like to. I'd like to be able to take the public transport to places at least as long as I'm in the city.\n\nHere are a few factors that I don't really care much about:\n\n1. I would like to save money, but earning a lot of money is not a huge factor for me. I have no loans, and would rather live happy and satisfied than rich and miserable.\n2. I'm a stay at home and play games kind of person, so I don't really need to live near nature/beautiful places. I also don't mind rough climates.\n3. I love to learn languages, currently I know like 3, and I'm learning Japanese. Going to a place where I'd be forced to learn a new language is a total benefit and I'm really cool with it.\n\nThere are a lot of options I'm considering, but right now the major ones are : Munich, Zurich, Norway and Amsterdam. I'm also thinking of Vancouver, Singapore and Australia but lack enough knowledge to decide. I would love to work in Japan, but I've heard of extremely bad work-life balance, and that's a very important factor for me.\n\nAnother thing I had to consider was what would be the best way to relocate. Would it be better to apply for a second masters in chosen country(I have a bit of savings from my past year and half of work) and then apply for a job? This would give me time to settle in, learn the language, and would give a favorable approach to the companies in said country?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would really appreciate any advice that people can give me on this matter.",

Students get lots of opportunities to work at great software companies so I think that makes this program a bit better than CS at some other schools. Math and CS are in the same faculty by the way, so I do get CS classes offered however, there are still many higher-level ones that I cannot take.\n\nDo you think it'd be worth going for a boot camp as a math major or should I be fine with the classes offered in my program?

As such, many of my courses have involved artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision concepts. \n\nI have no years of experience because I have never had a job before. I need a little help with what steps to take to get that first job/internship in the AI/ML/CV field. \n\nI'm not sure if that's even possible. Am I supposed to get some SWE experience first, then transition into a AI/ML/CV role? \n\nCan you give advice on which companies to look for which hire entry-level employees in the AI/ML/CV fields?\n\nCan you give guidance on how I should do the job search? Which keywords to search? Which websites to search on?\n\nJust looking for a bit of guidance as to how to break into the industry.\n\nThanks for any guidance!\n\nEdit: I'm not looking to do research or get a PhD. I wanted to have a role at the intersection of SWE and AI/ML/CV.",

I did have an interview with the place I worked at for tech grad scheme, kind of flopped it in November my fault tbh for not preparing enough.\n\nBut since march I've been actively working on my skills got a AWS Cloud Practitioner and I thought I'll get the AWS associate as well but wasn't interested as I realised It's not worth much without any experience. So I've been applying for multiple roles in graduate schemes or junior jobs such as Cyber security, technical engineer, devops, software developer and etc. Out of the 100 I've got like 5 first part assessments and a hirevue video, unfortunately I've failed every single one of them before getting to the 2nd stage. Other than one which is pending which I don't think I'll pass either.\n\nI'm just confused like I know a bit of python and I've been working on it recently to get better. But even if i was good at it,  one of the assessment question was about solving something with javascript which I don't know much about. And even if practice that, what if they ask a question in C++. Like it  just seems like endlessly shit I need to learn to even be considered and that's if I learn the right things which will get me a job. Everyone says Leetcode but I don't think I've been asked any questions related to that.\n\nSo I don't even know what to work on. Sorry for the rant, just feels depressing. Almost wished I had just practised for that interview back in November as it was a lot easier than all this and I wouldn't be in this situation. Any suggestion or advice would be appreciated.\n\nAlso I've had offers for companies like FDM who lock you in for 2 years, been considering it recently as I'm starting to get a bit desperate. ",

They gave me a lot of control over projects and I felt like I was really helping.\n\nThe other is at Amazon under retail where the wlb was good, and the location is more preferred (Vancouver vs Fremont). I learned here as well, but not to the extent as Tesla. But I enjoyed my time after work as the work weeks weren't insane, however there is a lot less control here as the scale is just so much larger and interns/L4s won't have too much say in the beginning.\n\nIn terms of pay, both are good enough for me to be comfortable so I am really more interested in where I would be able to grow into a better engineer.

We have a new manager since a few months that set a requirement for us to book our worktime 15 minutes at a time. We are not allowed to broadly book multiple hours on a project, we have to book the exact time we worked on a ticket, e.g. 15 minutes \"Bug fix for JIRA issue 242\", 20 minutes \"Discussing a Problem with coworkers\". This need for exact time tracking is having a big hit on my motivation, since it only costs time for developers and engineers that could be used to work on problems instead. The billing for the customer is only on project basis, so it is not exactly a benefit to break it into single tickets. Finding the right ticket for every action not always easy and quite time consuming.\n\nAm I overreacting and is this normal in most companies, or is this too much micromanagement?",

While I love my job for the most part, I am not particularly fond of HTML and CSS and find myself drawn to coding in JS. While I am not actively looking for a new job with COVID, I do like to browse the job boards and see what skills are in demand and I have come to the realization that I am no longer interested in JUST front end. I have an interest in Full Stack/Back End/Data Science/ML.\n\nWhen I look at positions such as software engineer, I find that I am unqualified for most aspects of jobs in regards to backend (obviously), while I learned most of the skills for back end (PHP, .NET, SQL etc.) when I was in school, I don't use them in my day to day job and haven't for over 2 years and don't feel comfortable listing these skills on a resume. Even though I've been employed professionally for 2 years, due to company secrets I am unable to show most of my work or code and my GitHub is very bare so I don't feel like I am a good candidate with nothing to show. I have been dabbling in Python on my own time but I don't think it's sufficient to land me a new job as a different type of developer.\n\nTo remedy this, I have given up my full time job and enrolled in Computer Science at an accredited university in the Fall. I have only divulged this to a few people on my development team and they told me it was a waste because I have experience working as a developer, I can learn backend on my own and that I'm giving up a full time job and benefits for a piece of paper. While I have no intention of changing my mind as I have already committed and my partner and I have made arrangements to handle being down to one salary, by no means do I feel as though I made the wrong choice but I do feel discouraged and anxious. \n\nSo my question to you fellow redditors is: in this case, is job experience worth more than education? How should I move forward in my career (with or without a Computer Science degree).\n\nThank you all for reading and I appreciate any and all feedback.",

I've wanted to work for Google my whole life and was ecstatic when I was hired.\n\nI thought Google would leverage me into a nice programming job, but in the past few weeks I've been applying I've had terrible luck.\n\nOne recruiter called me on the phone (not a programmer, just a recruiter)   \n\"Oh that's nice you work for Google... wait, so you don't have any professional coding experience yet?\" I tried to elaborate: I'm one year out of college and have tons of GitHub projects and can easily do a coding interview, but he didn't care. He started asking me how long I've been applying and how many interviews I've gotten in a condescending way, as if there was something wrong with me. It made me feel stupid.\n\nI'd like a non-remote, front end job that makes at least $50,000; Should I lower my expectations and try to snag a $20 an hour internship, or a remote job to get my foot in the door?

Actually trapped... this program promises reimbursement of tuition at the end of my PhD, and since I\u2019ve already taken out another loan while in this job, I would have to eat it if I quit. I started during COVID, so I have no coworkers other than my intense supervisor. I feel alone, lost, and completely overwhelmed. \n\nI have a Masters in mathematics and I\u2019m now working on a PhD in Computational Science. School was easy (relative to what I\u2019m doing now), but I also went to a university that isn\u2019t very impressive on a resume. My advisor was SUPER chill, and a pretty big hand-holder. He is also the professor of most classes I\u2019ve taken in my field. He\u2019s still my advisor now, but this job at the lab has become the majority of my focus, so we don\u2019t communicate as much anymore. My supervisor at the lab is the complete opposite of my academic advisor. No jokes, no positive feedback, no negative feedback. Just a super serious Russian that makes me want to cry after every one of our weekly (virtual) meetings. \n\nI don\u2019t want to blame it on imposter syndrome.. I want to hold myself accountable.. but I literally feel too stupid and inadequate for this job. I\u2019m living in constant fear of being fired or let go just because I\u2019m not moving quickly enough or coming to conclusions as soon as I feel like my supervisor would like. And honestly, I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I wish they would just fire me. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s pretty hard to get fired from a government scientist position just from inadequacy. \n\nGoing from being a 3.8 GPA student who stayed extremely busy with jobs, clubs, and sports to being stuck in my apartment in a new city with no friends and a job I absolutely despise, my mental health has taken a toll. I truly don\u2019t know what to do. Suck it up and get through this next 1.5 years just so they pay for my school and then leave, or eat my PhD loan and perhaps find something I actually enjoy? My boyfriend says it would be irrational to leave, and I get that. I don\u2019t think he realizes just how unhappy I am. I\u2019ve always been good at everything I\u2019ve done, but with this I feel like they hired me thinking I knew OpenFOAM and CFD modeling already. I thought this was going to be a learning experience, and it is... but the only thing I\u2019m learning from is YouTube. \n\nAnyways, this has become quite a rant. I just wanted to hear from others that may have had the same experience. If anyone can give me some light at the end of the tunnel, it would be immensely appreciated.",

I actually quite like to write procedural code in C. It makes sense to me and I think it has been of great help understanding dynamic memory allocation and ADTs.

How should I approach these 2 different paradigms \"at the same time\"? Or does it really matter what paradigm it is? Should be focusing on something else?\n* When it comes to theoretical/math classes: I consider myself a curiosity-driven person, and the theoretical concepts of CS (mainly Discrete Maths related topics) were not really what drew me into programming and computing in general and I'm finding some difficulty in grasping these concepts while handling the other classes.\n   * 2. I'm not looking for \"tips and tricks\", as I don't believe in that. I'm kind of trying to figure out  a way to get a better method and conduct to dedicate myself to these topics. Can anyone help me with this?\n* Now, this has been my biggest fear. I've really struggled to harmonize all these different topics (theory, practice, maths...)  and make them work together throughout my learning process. It's been really difficult to focus on one thing without jeopardizing other(s).\n   * 3.

I was expecting I should be only a Senior developer here, as it was promised to me when I entered. For other circumstances, I ended up being a team leader, a QA, an analyst, and customer support. My thought was \"This should be very demanding, but I'll take as an opportunity to build up my career\"\n\nWell I haven't taken into account the culture of the organization: My boss and also owner of the startup (a.k.a. upper management) doesn't listen to my advice for the project and ideas on how to improve (and I mean fix) the workflow. Which means me and my 5-dev team are stuck with developing without proper testing environments, delaying many features requested by my boss because he isn't clear with requirements and goals (that's when I stepped as an analist to help, but no luck. Many times once I got all the requirements right with him and after finishing a feature, he decided to scrap the idea as it didn't turn out to be like he wanted it) and had to make many installations on customers without proper version control, and even we've had to install the latest version (unclear with it's features) for one of the Big4 (one of our customers) without having even tested said app, which I've considered as being the final straw.\n\nI've tried talking to him and trying to convince him many times (always in a polite but serious and professional manner) in implementing a better workflow, version control, and project goals and I was always met with a \"You're right, let's do it\" response just for him to forget what we discussed in only a matter of hours. In his defense, he has to deal with a lot of customers and sales which I know it can be tiresome, and I do believe I'm trying to put on myself too many roles in this company which in turn is making me less effective.\n\nWhich it all leads to my question, **How can I quit this job gracefully?** Despite all of this I have a pretty good relationship with my peers and I'm not sure in leaving them behind (as they also don't like my boss professional behavior), and also my boss can be a very impulsive person, I'm even afraid of his reaction. This has droven me to the point where I want to quit without having other job lined up (it has its pros and many cons, but I could really use that free time to ramp up my knowledge as a developer in areas where my current job doesn't allow)",

I had a question or two about switching from a *completely* unrelated field to software engineering, and I couldn't think of a better sub to post in than here.\n\nI've been teaching English for 5 years now and have become increasingly attracted to the software engineering field. Conversely, I've been quickly losing interest and satisfaction in my current vocation. After giving it nearly a year of thought, I've decided to switch paths.\n\nSo, I've been studying Python closely for the past 8 months. I've read various textbooks cover to cover and have completed online courses in it. I've created my own beginner/intermediate-level projects and have a GitHub, which I try to update as much as possible. I've completed 60+ coding challenges of various difficulties. And I started a Udemy course on Data Structures & Algorithms. On top of it all, I love it all more and more every day, and it's quickly changing from \"hobby\" to \"passion.\" But I don't know where to go from here.\n\nSo far, my long-term goals are:\n\n* Learn about HTML, JS, CSS, some Bash, some SQL, maybe some C++, since I use it for building/writing in Arduino (my related side-hobby).\n* Create and maintain 4 or 5 longer-term, larger-scale Python projects on my GitHub, since I hear having an active GitHub is central to interviewers.\n* NOT attending a boot camp or going back to get a CS degree, since it would be a waste of money for me (I already know a lot of the basics of programming and have good enough self-discipline to continue teaching myself, which is what I plan to do instead).\n* Read through a number essential textbooks, such as *Cracking the Coding Interview*, *Clean Code*, *Beyond the Basics with Python*, etc.\n* APPLY APPLY APPLY, since I hear that you have to really grind to get a shot at a job as a newbie these days.\n\nThe *dream*, while far-fetched, is to get a junior engineer position this summer so that I don't have to work again in September as an English teacher, and can start my new career path ASAP. The *goal*, while more realistic, is to get one by the end of Spring 2022 (or early in the summer 2022). I live in a major metropolitan area (NOT Silicon Valley, sadly). I'm not 100% about my desired specialty, but I was thinking along the lines of full-stack developer, since both frontend and backend are equally appealing to me.\n\nWhere would you suggest I go from here to learn efficiently, and land a job as quickly as possible?

Recently in my organization I have seen that people who work on big data analytics and data science have been getting a lot of exposure and recognition and I kind of felt that my profile is nothing as compared to them. Got worried that in coming future will I have to pick up something new or to grow as a professional do I need to switch to python data science or any other streams lke that.\nThere has been so much hype about AI/Ml big data and it sounds so fascinating that I feel the work that we do is nothing compared to theirs.\nI do not actually have a preference right now kind of lost actually.

        "body": "So I'm back, clearly doing what someone in this subreddit told me not to do if I took the job. I just needed to get this out, maybe get some peoples opinions again.\n\nso basically here's [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hl78y1/best_friend_is_offering_me_a_job_i_know_im/) of this post, don't really need to read it as I'll give the jist of it but it does contain insights as to why I'm not really a good programmer and don't really enjoy this job...\n\nTechnical Manager/Solutions Architect Bestfriend offered to help me out, gave me months to prepare for a software engineering job. Originally he wanted me to get a sort of level 1-2 position. To be completely honest with myself, no amount of preparation was going to get me worthy of a MID to SENIOR position (even if he was able to pull the strings to do so) so I took the lowest one as a junior/associate SE.\n\nI got the job, doesn't pay great but I live alone and so the pay is more than enough for me to survive life and even spend a little on my hobbies. There was a 9 week paid bootcamp, comes with a 2 year bond though (I did not leave this out intentionally in the last thread, because the original plan was for me to take a mid level position which I hesitated), I passed that and was put into an ongoing sprint which is managed by my bestfriend (so basically another charity case by him) with a small team of 5 devs (including me) about 2 months ago.\n\nIt started okay, but the pressure was honestly there, I was completely blind at the start but I understood from most posts here that what I felt was normal, but here's comes the part that I hate. The job environment is tbh very chill, the people are good to me , they help me out but I'm just not really good at this, the previous sprint I did not sleep properly for 3 days just to keep up with the work load, I forgot to eat on most days, I would work for free through the night and weekends just to keep up with the deadlines and I assure you the things I'm working on doesn't even seem hard its just I suck... bad.\n\nI would ask help from my team but unless they spoonfed me, most explanations would go over my head and I always feel embarrassed whenever I force myself to ask them. My bestfriend would help me out on numerous occasions just for me to finish a couple of the work assigned to me and I really feel like he's sick and tired of it.\n\nBasically, I have to endure this for a year and a half more Unless I wanted to go AWOL, which I can't really afford. I keep begging my bestfriend to put me into support work, which is bug fixing but he says I would never grow there but I'm honestly just so tired of not having to sleep or eat just to keep up with these 2 week sprints. I feel like I am not ready for this and It's not like I even feel joy whenever I finish my work. There's absolutely no satisfaction here except for that twice a month paycheck.\n\nI'm really considering just begging people to take me out of the team, It would probably be a horrible idea to go into a division that doesn't offer growth but I just want to survive, I cant keep this up, I am a mess and I am so unhappy. I can endure this and pretend like I'm getting better but I think my team wouldn't appreciate their work getting blocked and looking bad infront of the client every time a sprint ends.\n\nIs this all worth it and I'm just too easy to give up? I don't remember the last time I was able to sleep a full 8 hours tbh.\n\nEdit: clarifications about the bootcamp and the bond that came with it.",

But they have access to others branch and they verbally figure out who did this commit/merge stuff.**\n* I don't think startup have any goal it's just a company who pick projects and make some node website like currently she is working on a library organization software. Some foreign company hiring cheap dev. in India.\n* She asked to leave the job but they are giving a new project offer next month which she can lead. But she is new, she is very inexperience in development field, but in this startup she is a valuable employee. Her skills are better than most of co workers. Everything seem pretty unorganized in that startup. I don't think she can learn anything in this job.\n* Startup seem too friendly. Her HR is very friendly and less professional. They are asking for personal issues, why she want to leave this startup and  what new job she will do after this?\n* I think this new \"government\" project is like a bait, which is going to suck one more month of her life.\n* She is working hard. But the amount salary is very less according to amount of work.\n* This week she didn't even got weekend break of Sat/Sun.\n* She is tensed for her career love to hear some career guidance.\n\nMy idea is she still have 2 months left in her graduation. (yeah In India student start doing job before getting degree) So I am asking her to just use lockdown period to enhance her skills in 1-2 months and then making some of her own side projects. Creating her own website and then making a strong resume/profile engaging in open source / hackathons and eventually end up in a quality startup or MNC.\n\nBut she is afraid of my idea what if she lose this opportunity and end up even worse and even I am also afraid of giving advice since I am inexperienced.\n\nPS: I am not against working in startup but this startup doesn't seem good.",

I have experience with both SQL and NoSQL and I can write complex SQL queries and automate data pipelines through Python, create APIs to interact with databases. I love talking about databases and implement it from scratch, figure out how to clean and store data and develop API to extract data from databases. I have also experience with Linux administration, bash automation. I also talked to customers and their needs and based on the requirements, designed table schema. \n\nNow my resume shouts Software Developer. I passed AWS CCP exam, working on AWS SAA exam. I am also doing a side project to show my caliber with cloud.\n\nI applied to hundreds of Cloud Support Engineer positions (in hope to get promoted to Solutions Architect position in a few years) but I still only get interview calls for development roles. \n\nQuestions:\n\n1. How can I get into Cloud roles/architect roles? \n2. What certifications/courses I should do to gain knowledge with database architecture? \n   1.

What are highly SQL oriented jobs I could take ? \n\nI am horribly confused and lost and unable to get any job (even entry level). How to solve this problem? Software Engineering is all about solving problems and I feel ashamed I could not solve my own hurdles with career migration. I know what my goal is, what I want to do and I am working to get it also but I am not seeing any return on investment.

And the stats specialization just doesn\u2019t cover enough stats. \n\nAn MS in stats would greatly diversify my skills, since a strong cs background with rigorous graduate level statistics coursework sounds very employable. However, my concern is that it would hold very little value as, my understanding is that, companies teach all the necessary stats for the job. I don\u2019t know if this extends to graduate level stats though. \n\nLastly comes the MSDS, a perfect mix of CS and stats which would build off of my BS in CS and math perfectly. Plus, DS is a rapidly growing field. However, my understanding is that this is just a watered down version of the MSCS degree, a money-making scheme, and because its scope covers two large subjects (stats and DS), it doesn\u2019t go into sufficient depth for either. \n\nHence, I am left extremely confused. I definitely want to pursue a MS, I\u2019m just not sure which one would be the best one. Please help!\nAlso, my aim is to get into quantitative finance but I am definitely also open to data science and SWE roles.",

        "body": "For context, I'm a non traditional student who's essentially starting over from scratch in his college career. 26 years old. I've seen advice that it's not wise to take out more than 50k in loans for a CS degree. I'm planning to go to community college for a year and transfer to my target state school, but my parents are retirement age. My father is already on a fixed income and my mother is a few years away from retirement and not that high income. So I can't necessarily count on them to help, even though they say they will as much as they can.\n\nWithout taking loans, how does one live with any dignity for 4 years without taking out massive debt?\n\nFor the record, I wouldn't necessarily be opposed to taking out 80k+ in loans in my current situation if I was certain the job market for CS grads would be strong in 4 years. But with automation and possible climate crisis within the coming decades I don't know how much I can count on the stability of this profession, even though it's likely to be safe from automation for longer than the majority of professions.\n\nI'd assume some would suggest taking on-campus jobs and such. Are those enough to cover living and food expenses? I called a college advisor for my target school and she said many upper-level CS students end up dropping their jobs because it's impossible to handle the curriculum with even a part time job\n\nI guess my question goes to people who did a CS degree without much support from their parents, and no savings... what's the best way to go about this?\n\nMy other option is to cut my losses and just try to land IT jobs now with the certifications I spent years getting. I've recently lost confidence in that route because I realize that I'd make much more long term with a degree, but in the short term, I could likely command a decent enough salary and be able to live much more comfortably short term, while still being able to build experience and work my way up. This is honestly the path my heart wants but my brain is leading me towards the CS path, even though the more I think about it, the more unlikely it seems that I'll be able to achieve it without massive loan debt in my 30s\n\nLong story short, stay in school",

I despise the mundane nature of job.Thanks to my experience in startup, I find immense happiness in talking to people...trying to give analogies to explain ideas and solutions and i do it better than most in my opinion as in the past ive seen it working for me when pitching freelance projects to business owners. I love coming up with solutions to problem and in my personal opinion the design position is a more people oriented(not completely but the sweet balance).\n\nBIG DILEMMA:  So far i have always loved challenges and since i have never had mainstream software development experience i clinged on to the idea of spending sometime poilishging my iOS developer skillset but only to feel that as and when i start working in companies my job would become specific and i wouldnt be getting my hands dirty or say in UI/UX design so often and which would ultimately make me feel bored and come off as wrong choice... Design however is not challenging skill-wise but the job  itself is all about diving into the unknown to and create so that is enticing too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBACKGROUND AND TIMELINE: DESIGN portfolio would take 3 months and iOS DEVELOPER portfolio would take 4-5 months to get me at a confident job ready position(IMO)\n\nSince im a newbie to jobs, please help me understand how to go about this conundrum.",

I don't even understand how companies expect us to solve questions on these advanced concepts in OA's that usually last between 30-90 minutes (the 90-minutes ones usually have 2-4 such questions). Some say that the on-site interviews are usually easier than such OA's, but how do we even reach the onsite interview stages without being able do to well on these OA's?\n\nI know that interview prep sites like Leetcode might have questions on such advanced topics but I would prefer a book similar to EPI/CTCI because I think that the explanation and structure of books helps me learn better and quicker.

Long story short, I am trying to pursue a computer programming career and just trying to get started into what field would fit me best is so overwhelming. I think Cybersecurity would be great because of the challenge aspect of keeping your program as secure as possible. I also find front-end development interesting considering that's the actual part of the program users interact with. I would be very happy with a path to developing video games but it just seems like such a specific skillset that if I needed to broaden out into a different job field I wouldn't be prepared. I've taken classes on Python, Java, and Excel VBA, but when I try to connect the dots I can't put my finger on what exactly the path I want to pursue and put my energy into.

        "body": "I am keen to change careers to something CS.  I think I am primarily motivated by building or developing useful products -  so the obvious long term target for me would be a software development/engineering role. (I'm not so keen on doing ad hoc/ exploratory analysis, for example, although don't mind it)\n\nHowever, I'm thinking that my current career / life situation might suggest that the typical path into SWE isn't the most optimal choice for me:\n\n* I'm a social researcher. As of recently, I'm embedded within a team of data scientists, who seem to like me and have expressed (without me asking) a desire to develop me into a \"hybrid\" data scientist/social researcher. \n* I have several years' experience as a social researcher - i.e. specifying, designing and managing research and analysis for internal customers in a large organisation - so (I think?) a similar \"soft\" skillset to that of a data scientist. Plus a sprinkling of (applied) stats.\n* 30 yo., just bought a house, and my partner and I are planning to start a family in the next year or two\n* I'm not paid super well currently, but a bit higher than most entry level tech salaries for my area (London).  Moving down to entry-level for a few years would be doable but very tough given our current stage in life, unless I managed to get something at the very top end of entry level (which I don't think I can rely on given my background)\n\nI'm planning to start a part time MSc in September. I know opinions vary on whether this is necessary but it isn't too expensive, it suits me to have external accountability for learning (especially if/when family comes along), and I worry that my non-STEM background makes it more necessary than if I had a Bachelors in something STEM. It will take two years and after that I expect to start looking for jobs.\n\nMy current thinking is that I could do one of the following: \n\n1) \\[CS Masters + current \"hybrid\" role\\]  ->  \\[Junior SWE + financial hardship\\]  ->  \\[Mid/Senior SWE\\]\n\n2) \\[Data Science Masters + current \"hybrid\" role\\] -> \\[mid-level Data scientist\\] -> \\[mid-level Machine Learning Engineer\\]\n\nCurrently, option 2 feels like it gets me where I want to go (building useful products, in this case as an MLE), while leveraging my current situation and previous experience a bit more so I have a salary bump, rather than a cut, in the middle. \n\nThe Data Science MSc I am looking at is based in a CS department rather than a Stats/Maths one - it's actually quite similar to the CS degree, but focusing on Python/R/Analysis/ML rather than covering Python/Java/C#/Software principles. Both share the same core of algorithms / data structures etc.,. In my current role there are opportunities to work on the python/Django codebase for an internal application the team maintain, so it feels like I could lean into the engineering side of the data science skillset pretty heavily early on.\n\nI guess the major assumptions I'm making here are that:\n1) MSc plus 2 years \"hybrid\" data science plus research background sets me up better initially in data science than SWE.\n2) Data science -> MLE is doable in not too long a timeframe. \n\nMy question is whether these assumptions are reasonable?  Plus interested in any other reflections on my overall thought process from you wise folks.\n\nEdited for clarity of current role and assumptions.",

At the beginning I liked coding, but then I started seeing it as repetitive and the enthusiasm started fading off. I have the impression that the challenges we are given are of immediate solution and there isn't much space for creativity, which is often (rightfully) labelled as \"overengineering\". I have seen a previous post talking about boring CRUD work and I feel like that describes exactly the problem. The way I see it, after some time the progress in software engineering is more about soft skills, management and the right 'gut feeling' to make some technical calls, which is great but not really my cup of tea.\n\nSo my idea is to look for more technical challenges by moving to security and this would be my carreer plan for the future:\n\n- resign and study security (possibly getting some certifications).  \n- get some experience as security researcher, maybe somewhere in the academic.  \n- apply for security research positions (as far as I understand, they only exist in big N companies).  \n\nBut I have some questions about it:\n\n- do you see some misconceptions in what I wrote? Am I lacking some understanding of the IT world?   \n- do you know some (academic) insitutions where I could get some experience? So far I have only found the Citizen Lab, a research group that focuses on emerging threats for human rights activists. How does someone become a security researcher otherwise?   \n- the carreer plan I wrote above is just \"shooting for the stars\" of course. I know it might not turn out the way I hope, but I still guess that I would land somewhere in between. I have looked for some information in the internet and it feels like security engineers (like pen testers, soc analysts, etc...) earn less than SWE. Is that true? I am okay with losing some money, but I would like to know it before jumping into this field.   \n- for security researchers out there. Do you feel your work is actually technically challenging everyday? Or do you feel like the enthusiasm fades away at some point like for every other job?   \n- I probably already know the answer, but work to life balance is important to me. I like, for example, working part time 80% because I like having three days off a week. Is it something I am never ginna be able to do if I go for security research?    \n- I am doing plans in security because I like it particularly, but a hot topic in research is also data science and I definetly wouldn't mind that. Are there more opportunities there? I know there are a lot opportunities, but also a lot of competition. Are the earnings generally better?",

I've applied for inter nships over the past 4 years and sometimes I've made it past the assessments, sometimes I've had int erviews, and mos of the time it's been no response. I definitely think my resume isn't too bad, have a decent amount of side projects and my own website and stuff. People who have worked multiple jobs have gone over my resume and said it's pretty good for having no experience.\n\nThe thing is man, seeing all these others around me starting new internships and coops for the last 4 years has been pretty demoralizing. To the point where I have actually deleted LinkedIn, everytime I open it, it's just Congratulate X for starting at Tesla or Y for starting at MSFT. It really makes you feel hopeless knowing there are other students graduating with you with almost 2+ years of experience already and you got nada. Especially in Canada where the co-op placements are excellent at schools like Waterloo and such, which is a silicon valley breeding ground. I have cousins who have graduated in mechanical engineering and finance who are all working IT/Computer jobs now and yet I feel that I will have nothing upon graduation with a CS degree. Competition feels fierce and it really looks bleak for someone graduating next year with no experience. I'm a US citizen as well and have been applying to literally every major city in North America with little luck the last 2 summers. I hope new grad positions arent as competitive as some of these internships, since there's way less people graduating compared to the years 1-4+ students all competing for the same internships.\n\nHave any of you graduated with no experience at all with just some projects and managed to get a job right after uni in development? I'm honestly really scared for when I graduate, the loan payments will start pretty soon and it feels like a dead end with stiff competition, despite me graduating with such an 'employable' degree.\n\nFeels like everyone in this sub is either a master programmer or someone who's landed a great job, or a student doing a great internship then posting here that you too can do it. I don't know man, things are looking bleak. I literally had an offer this summer which was in a finance position, which they just rescinded a week before it starts saying that I couldn't work from out of the US, when they literally said it was fine during the offer call *6 months ago*",

        "body": "Dear careers hivemind of Reddit, I'm at bit a of a fork in the road career-wise - would love some thoughts from people here on the options! Especially from anyone who's made similar decisions, from hiring managers on how they'd think about job history, or from folks who've moved into consultancy.\n\nI recently moved from a well-established company I'd been at 5+ years to a startup. I was successful at the bigger company (went from entry-level to 'staff' title, had lots of opportunities for advancement). The startup has a very appealing tech stack and they really like me, but their culture has a lot of red flags - the CTO (who I report to) is lovely, but there are things I strongly dislike about how the CEO and COO treat their staff. The job is well paid.\n\nI have also been spending some time working with a very ethically focused group which does consulting for small clients: it is fun, it gives an opportunity to learn how to pitch and quote for things. But scalability/reliability work is only a small part of it, their CI/CD stuff isn't mature at all. It's much lower paying, but I feel pretty comfortable with explaining that away to a future employer. \n\nSo I'm torn - on the one hand, sticking it out for a year at the startup and getting them doing true continuous delivery and helping them mature would be more interesting work and a great story to tell. It's the kind of thing that'd be easy to pitch conference talks about! But the culture at the non-profit place is great and I think there's also interesting work to be done there - most people don't have much industry experience so my perspective could really help them. It'd also be much more chill in terms of working hours & avoiding burnout, so I am wondering if I could do a bunch of \"brand building\" type blogging/side projects/etc to build towards taking on some little bits of consulting work while I was there.\n\nI'm wondering:\n\n* If you made a choice to move to a non-conventional place and back, were you happy with it? If you've tried to move back since, was that harder than moving from like-to-like?  \n* If you do consultancy, do you have a sense of what in your past jobs helped get you clients, and how much having buzzwords and experience in fast-paced places like startups is a factor?\n* If you're a hiring manager, would you think it'd be a strength or a weakness for candidates to have done something a bit left field?",

It\u2019s that kind of proprietary software where anything remotely code-related is locked in a black box to which you have no access (which is understandable since it\u2019s the money maker) but very shitty documentation.\nHowever my main motivation is that I feel like ServiceNow doesn\u2019t allow space for technical growth? Compared to other (open source) tools, where you know that you\u2019ll gain constant learning experience from them, ServiceNow implementations are very repetitive and  once you\u2019ve done it several times, it becomes pretty predictable.\nI\u2019ve managed to get a job as a SWE at a big insurance company here but I\u2019m\nbeing told that leaving the ServiceNow world is a bad idea since there\u2019s space for evolution career-wise and I personally disagree, I feel like integrating solutions like SNow is a place where careers die\u2026\nLemme know what you guys think",

I've been unemployed for a couple months now, during which I applied to a lot of developer jobs (haven't experienced much success during all this). I mostly just want to get myself out there. I was thinking maybe if I just start working for a certain company (whatever job that may be), I can maybe talk to some developers there and ask for advice that could help me transition to a developer job later on within that company.",

I was inclined towards option 1 in the first place and all the comments helped me see that I will be making the right decision by going with it! No longer conflicted, appreciate all the resources!\n\nOriginal post below:\n\nA little background about me:\n\n* Graduated from a #1 CS university in US but with BS & MS in Mechanical Engineering \ud83d\udee0\n* Currently enrolled in the online MS in CS program at Georgia Tech, anticipate graduation in Spring 2022.\n* Two years of experience at a Fortune 500 company as a mechanical engineer, barely did anything related to software development.\n\nI've been looking to do a career switch for a while and I found myself currently in two situations to achieve that:\n\n1. Take an offer from my current company to make a lateral move as a software engineer likely making somewhere between $85k--$100k (it's an internal arrangement, number hasn't been decided on yet). However, the company is an old aerospace company and have been slow at growing their technology portfolio. There will likely be a lot of self-learning involved and the skills developed may be scattered.\n2. Leave my current company and invest in interview prepping (leetcode & algorithm review) and building up a portfolio of personal projects to take advantage of the upcoming Fall 2021 hiring season for new grads of 2022. I am in a financially stable place to be without income for a year. However, I don't have any industry experience related to SWE and SDE and would likely have to rely a lot on personal projects for the resume.\n\nIn the perspective of career growth over the next five years, which option would be more beneficial for me in the long term (assuming I join a well-established tech company with option #2)? If I were to take option #1, which job level should I be searching at after 2 years, entry-level or mid-level?\n\nReally appreciate the guidance!",

        "body": "Hi folks,\n\nFirstly, I think this sub hears this a lot from people my age but I believe everyone has a separate store and path, so here is mine. This one is gonna be a big ass post, but I really require some decent advice to take the next step here.\n\nI am a CS graduate from India, have been interested into tech since school, did stuff from HTML to Android Studio to Android ROM development to what not.\n\nGot placed into a Big 4 consulting tech US India office as a Business Analyst. Got into an 4-yr running insurance project having a workforce of 350+. Started off as a QA for 2 months, switched to API Integration dev etc, mastered Mulesoft ESB. Got to know lots of people, got some awards. Handled project final go-live solo for the team after senior team-members were taken off the project. Left the company after completing a year.Pros: Amazing people and culture, great fun; Cons: very monotonous work, meager salary\n\nJoined a small startup as the first person in tech, through a friend who knew the CEO of the startup. They were looking for CTOs/Tech folks and somehow wanted me to join after a couple of intro/coffee/beer meetings. I wasn't confident at first (cuz I am not at all a great coder or experienced developer), but felt I have nothing to lose and incredible stuff to see and learn. I worked after hours of my MNC job for 6 months and then joined as full-time. I started with writing the first line of code back in Jan 2020, and right now leading a team of 8 (devs/mobile/design/QA) working on 2 projects with \\~10k users.\n\nPros:\n\n* Crazy adventure, I feel I learnt endless stuff about tech, people, startups, business etc;\n* Brainstormed an idea with the team in lockdown which became the flagship product of the company and got us funding; handled every single technical decision of the product (it's a software offering for insurance policyholders, both web and mobile apps);\n* Technical things I supervised: Python, Django, Flutter, AWS, React, Figma, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, Firebase, JIRA, Trello, other third-party services; Amongst these, I have only learnt intermediate level python/Django and AWS I'd say, for all other items I depend on the people under me or the internet.\n* Also handled entire IT of the \\~100 employees using cPanel and Google Workspace;\n* Did couple of other stuff like setting up all social media, designing logos, wrote every single word of  content on the websites/apps.\n* I learnt a lot about Indian healthcare and insurance business, feels like I made my mark through the stuff I built\n* And a lot of other stuff...\n\nCons:\n\n* Incredibly hectic, everyone have their own demands from Tech team and just wants those done asap (all other teams and incl. the founders) and I am one of those \"Never Saying No\" folks so it just went pretty rough and bad; took a toll on my physical/mental health too; I know it's my fault too but I just was so attached to the project;\n* Decent compensation but no benefits; not even ESOPs or insurance as was promised during joining; don't see any fair growth in salary in future knowing the mindset of the founders;\n* No affirmation or support on my technical decisions: A lot of things I did went bad but I never knew they would. I am the most technical person in the whole company so everyone just left all things to me.\n* Other than people under me in my team, everyone in the company is like 10-15 years older to me;\n* Shit loads of mismanagement; leadership ain't focused on tech and just want Sales; Five people in leadership, no single person to take decisions; everyone has a separate opinion; co-founders themselves keep pitching the product in separate ways to potential investors/customers to lure them in;\n* No tools or metrics to track anything, be it revenue, tech, employees or anything; Not even a single line of documents/roadmap of the project; requirements/features keep changing every week (literally);\n* Every new idea is sent to tech team without any plan, execution, forecasting and wasted lot of time on those marketing/sales ideas that didn't work once;\n* People aren't hired based on skills and requirements; too much work pressure on each employee;\n* And majority of all, No empathy for employees, no culture or benefits or fun\n* Even after my resignation in April beginning, the CEO or others are not doing anything to find a replacement or get the knowledge-transfer from me\n\nSo my tenure ends on June 15 and I have no clue on what to do next. I feel I had more fun and more social in my first Big4 job, but i had more adrenaline/challenge and a matching role in the startup.I am not a pro coder but I like tech, experimenting with code and technologies. I have ventured into hundreds of different items, but I lose interest in coding after sometime always. I definitely like being social, putting ideas to technical solutions, planning out projects and features, feedback and debugging issues, and keeping the workplace fun for my colleagues. In both my jobs, I definitely put in a lot many hours than I was supposed to, only because I get attached to project/people/vision or probably cuz I take on whatever I can and people misuse that.\n\nHow can I assess myself in terms of strengths and interests and build a good skill for lifetime?And what kind of roles should I apply to?I think I should go slow,  learn something to build a strong resume and find a great-paying job in next 2-3 months? Or probably go for further studies like a Masters first? Or join a similar startup where I can contribute my technical and industry skills to?I wish to travel more than I have till now (both were like desk jobs), work on personal projects also, give some time to personal interests and play some regular football.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you guys, or connecting with people in the same boat or people who can mentor a lost mind. :)\n\nCheers.",

For some of you, that might mean, \"**how I ended up in this hot mess**,\" but for others, \"**how I found what I love doing**.\"\n\nFor context...\n\nI'm a veteran of several industries. I'm in my 40s with kids and all that jazz. After feeling rather isolated in some panic-driven startups, I thought I had finally settled into a relatively stable job where I'd eventually get into management, focus on helping other devs reach their career goals, ... and eventually retire. Turns out, after a couple years, this company is teetering at the edge of some big, strange pivots, and my specific working group's role in that transition... is... definitely in that \"hot mess\" category above.\n\nOur directors are visionaries who are really plugged into the state-of-the-art compared to the rest of our Midwestern company. I dig their ideas. So I leaned into reading up on the organizational/cultural factors that impact software development (Conway's Law, Project Aristotle, Theory of Constraints, etc). I learned about the tech stacks used for microservices and cloud-native architecture. I drank the kool-aid. Despite all this investment in the \"new way,\" beyond of our teensy group, the overall company doesn't really \"get it\" about what makes us different. And also, they really... super... don't... care. They just want to complete their project and cash today's check. As one of my coworker's put it, project managers \"jumping over dollars to grab their nickels.\" Bleh.\n\nAs a result of this impedance mismatch between business culture and development culture, my  job is just a ball of stress and conflict. On the one side, we've got devs being told to \"do it right\" and \"think globally, act locally,\" but on the other side you've got Scrumbots and middle management rearranging tickets, telling you to just cut the corners and there will be time for architecture \"later.\" Having to balance this every day is painful. Recognizing the need to hit timelines but also caring about long-term stability of the vision, I end up working insane hours to do both.\n\nI recently read \"[After Working at Google, I\u2019ll Never Let Myself Love a Job Again](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/opinion/google-job-harassment.html),\" and it struck sort of a nerve.\n\nI want my company to grow and change, but the skills required aren't technical. Shifting a non-tech company to a tech company is largely a social, political, and surprisingly sales-oriented (pitching *ideas*, mind you) problem. I have learned many of the rhetoric skills needed to slowly, but surely, change the climate at this company, but it's come with a cost. I realized recently that it was taking a toll on my physical and mental health, and it's eating away at the edges of who I am as a dad and husband. I feel compelled to do my job, like some sort of a personal mission, because if I don't, I'm sort of admitting that jobs *aren't* personal, it's just a paycheck.\n\nI'm considering a reboot - looking elsewhere to see what's around for a senior dev / software architect, but that question is still lingering out there for me. Do any of you have strong opinions about this? If you look for a job that's going to give you the space to maintain work/life separation, how do you identify that during your interview, too?",

The idea was the whole project would take a few weeks to complete, and me and Ben would split the work evenly. At the beginning, me and Ben had a meeting and divided the project into small subtasks, and agreed to each do half the tasks. But Ben worked over time every day and the weekend too (I saw him committing code to the repository late at night on Saturday), and finished his half of the tasks very quickly. Then he started giving me unsolicited \"tips\" on how to do my tasks (of course cc'ing the manager), and then he outright just started doing my tasks for me. The entire project got finished in a week, and Ben did 90% of the work. Ben is not smarter or more efficient than me, he's just willing to work unlimited over time. Of course Ben made sure the manager was aware he did most of the work and now the manager is very impressed with Ben.

If I don't follow through with this, I can split the 4 classes between Fall and Spring and graduate a semester later, with the possibility of getting internship in Fall and/or Spring. Furthermore, I'd have more time to prepare for tech interviews. What would you do? Is graduating with only one internship putting me at a disadvantage?",

        "body": "Long story short : I am 18, I love maths, and i want to become a programmer. I am scared that too applied informatics would bore me, so i would like a job in which I could do both maths and programming, with as much maths as possible (it is my passion). Any information is welcome, really. I want to make the right choice, i really don't want to live with any regrets. please help me !\n\nHi people.\n\nSo as I said, I love maths. I used to study lots of pure math problems when i was at high school, just for the love of it.\n\nMy question is : are there jobs in which I could do programming ; that involves lots of maths ?\n\nI guess you would answer 'yeah you know, you can't really do programming without maths' and i would agree with you. But there are some programmers that use more maths that others do : coding a website is diametrically opposite to coding a videogame or an AI.\n\nFor instance, my informatics teacher always links his courses to maths in some way : explaining some maths property and code it, numerically verify some theorem, plotting cardioids, the mandlebrot set, solving differential equations...\n\nI really like doing this kind of things. Pure maths, and then code it. As you can see my question is quite vague and general : it's actually more like a general **request for any information**.\n\nFor instance I saw in an exposition that rendering 3D graphics use a bunch of maths too ; including linear algebra. If you know hardly anything that concerns jobs that do lots of maths in programming, you can help me !",

        "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a University Graduate (CS Degree) that has been working for a few months (my first job) as a full-stack Javascript Developer (FE: ReactJS, BE: Nodejs). I mostly work on the Backend and ever since I started working I found myself with a lot of free time after work.\n\nSo, I decided to spend my free time adding cool projects to my portfolio, as a way of improving my backend skills and having something to show recruiters if something happens to my current job (trying to secure my future). My decision is to create a server project in which I will experiment with technologies used to better prepare myself for the future (such as TDD, Redis, Sockets, etc.).\n\nSo after I made that decision I started doing some research on Job sites in order to get a better view of the market. While researching Backend Jobs I found that a lot of jobs have in their requirements familiarity with one of these three languages:\n\n* Golang: I like the fact that it is a compiled language and it has a lot of capabilities. I have seen people use the language to build Emulators, to build Video processing, and run servers with microservices. I also like the fact that it is more strict than the other two as I feel that will help me become a better developer and think more about what a variable is and why it is used (this will help a lot with NodeJs as I will learn to write code that is going to be easier to optimize from the V8 engine)\n* Python: I have more experience with this language than Golang. I see that it is the most popular language used (after Javascript) in the workforce, but that is also because it is the default language for Data science and machine learning. Other than that I don't see any practical reason for using this language in my project.\n* Javascript: This language was not in as many job listings as the other two. I am most familiar with JS as it is the one that I use daily for my job. I feel that I will gain more from using JS over python but not as much as I will gain from using GO.\n\nSo with that being said, I need your help with these questions:\n\n1. Is the language used in a project important to Hiring Managers when looking at the projects of an applicant?\n2. I would like to go with GO (that sounds fun if you say it out loud) but I have heard that the market share is not as big as Javascript and I am afraid that it will hinder my chances in the long run.\n3. Also what advice do you have for someone that has just joined the workforce?\n\nThank you in advance for your answers.",

        "body": "Posting in this subreddit also to get wider opinions, thanks!\n\nHi All I would appreciate any advice on below:\nSo after having 2.5 years exp in java / spring boot I have started at a UK based software consultancy dealing with financial service clients. I joined about a month ago and was basically benched while waiting to onboard to a role so was just told to get on with some training /etc. So I haven't been coding properly for about a month now and found it hard to be productive with no real end goal in sight.\n\n Last week I onboarded to a FS client that was advertised as being a backend spring boot role however this was missold and the role is to actually develop API/s using Mulesoft software, there is no complexity in the work I have been set, requests come in JSON format and you have to perform some validation, generate some IDs, transform the format and pass it on. I feel like I won't be able to learn the skills I want to learn such as microservices, reactive coding, advanced spring knowledge, advanced java knowledge /etc. The list of skills I wish to learn is huge. \n\nAnother thing that hugely detracts me from the role is the fact there is no project structure whatsoever, no agile ceremonies apart from standup which seems to get cancelled most days, stories are incredibly badly written, they lack details but there are a huge amount of them (120 stories to develop 4 basic API endpoints) and overall lack of planning. There is no prioritisation in the stories, and no sprints defined although they don't work in Kanban either. Stories don't appear to be pointed and people generally seem to be quite lazy and just work on stuff when they feel like it.\n \nWhen I joined the team I was not told what I should be doing whatsoever (given a 10 year document on some software to install which was missing the vast majority of requests I had to make), no one introduced me to any code bases, any introduction into the mulesoft technology or how you would even develop something basic using it and then I've been told I should start working on a brand new API development starting on Monday after a literal 5 minute introduction into what I'll be doing. I've also checked and there is no code reviews or 1-1 with any software managers and no exposure to senior engineers as they are not involved due to architecting the overall solution.\n\nOne of the main reasons I left my previous job was the fact I had no exposure to good software practices, didn't work with seniors so I had nobody to learn from and the work I was doing wasn't challenging anymore so I wasn't getting incrementally better. I feel if I stay in this role I won't be getting the experiences I need to move into a senior developer position anytime soon, I don't want to be wasting my time not achieving the goals I have set for myself and besides that I want to be challenged in the right way, learn from others and get a variety of feedback so I can grow in the right way.\n\n Again all advice welcomed, thanks for reading :)",

First few months were okay, I was motivated and although there was no direct mentorship provided, I was able to complete the tasks without too much problems. The problem started this year, when the company decided to release new products every sprints. We have 5 people in our backend team to work on these features, and the projects have been successful that the company promised to reward us in the near future. I was promised to get a promotion in 2 months, which is nice. But I'm suffering from too much workloads and pressure. As a new grad, I was happy that I get to work on features that impact lots of users, and I was able to gain lots of experience by writing and managing services either by myself or with the team. The problem is I feel like my mental health is deteriorating and not the same anymore. Everyday, I wake up sweating and constantly worrying about the features I worked on that were released go wrong and it leads to production failure. My manager likes to sync up once a day outside standup to check how much we got done for the day to make sure we are on track for the sprint. He is usually a nice guy, but if any of the team members go against his ideas or when he misunderstand things, he starts to get frutstrated and shout at us. It just ruins my day and it usually happens 2 or 3 times in a 2 weeks sprint. I usually work on multiple tasks at the same time, whether it is to fulfill client's requests or its related to the microservices I own in which no one else has an idea how to fix the issues related to them. I am overwhelmed with amount of pressure I get everyday and workloads. We dont have QA so we have to make sure our code is running in a near perfect condition, otherwise my manager would go crazy. I measured how much I worked this week, I worked about 10 hours a day everyday without compensation. I dont feel happy and cant find motivation to work hard anymore but just feel constant pressure and goes through emotional rollercoaster everyday. I want to stick for another 4 months, but i feel like im getting burnt out quickly. Is this normal work environment ? Im not sure if Im asking for too much for wanting to work 8 hours without constant pressure to get the work done everyday. Or if this is because I am new to working in professional settings and I'll get used to getting shouted, stress and constant pressure. Any insights would be greatly appreciated.",

        "body": "I've seen a lot of posts on here about Talent Path and other consultant hiring agencies and the general consensus seems to be that they are a last resort option given the notable cons (lower than standard pay, 2-year contract, hit-or-miss training, etc). However, the most recent notable post on here about Talent Path is from several months ago, and it seems like there have been some considerable changes to the Talent Path program, at least temporarily, that I would appreciate some opinion(s) on. For some background information, I do not have an academic background in data analytics or programming beyond a Statistical Methods Minor (Statistics focused, and some basic R, SAS knowledge). I decided to pursue Data Analytics soon after graduating last May, and I've some basic certifications/self-teaching in Data Analytics, as well as R, SQL, Tableau, and Python. \n\nI got the offer from Talent Path after the standard hiring process (initial feeler phone call/interview, technical assessment, behavioral assessment, then final video interview). The official title is Junior Data Engineer consultant, although my would-be supervisor explained that the title can be flexible according to what each potential client might be looking for. I take this vagueness to be a con in general, although since I'm still really new to the whole Data field I am pretty open to what I will be learning/ultimately doing for the client.\n\nNow, for the perks/limitations, it seems that they have improved the benefits of the job in the last few months. Not sure what this is a result of, maybe a recent high demand for consultants or something to do with the remote workspace? Regardless, the pay has been bumped to $55,000 during training, $60,000 once placed. Furthermore, the training is currently completely remote, which is definitely more appealing than relocating before you have even gotten a feel for the whole program. Also, the contract period has been reduced from 24 months (2 years) to 15 months, which makes the biggest con IMO seem a lot more stomach-able. Finally, they guarantee a $5,000 raise after 12 months (although I am not sure if that is 12 months of on-the-job time or total, so this might just only be a mini-perk). \n\nI realize that for the majority of CS graduates, especially those from an elite school or with other potential prospects, this doesn't seem like an appealing option. I wanted some general advice on whether this seems reasonable for someone trying to break into the industry though, especially with the recent \"upgrades\" to the program. I'd also love any feedback from anyone who was recently or is currently in the training program or just started their client contract, I've gotten some good info from the recruiter/my potential supervisor, but I'd love some input from an actual consultant on the program (especially someone who is in the Data Analytics/Engineer/Science field).

I am looking for any advice as my timeline till graduation is much shorter compared to a freshman who has 4 years till graduation.\n\nThis summer I am going to do my first project to add to my resume, once I complete the project I plan on learning web development using FCC and TOP.",

I also used to learn Pascal as a kid, but I know no one uses it now.\n\nNow I can see I have a few different routes, but I am not sure which one will be best for me. I am located in Vancouver, Canada.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Coding bootcamp after graduate: Probably the quickest way, but I heard it is very hard to get a job as a software developer in Canada, without a CS degree.\n2. Local university have 2-year Bachelor of Computer Science program, tbh this looks like a coding bootcamp with longer time.\n3. Taking a few CS courses (probably a year) then apply for CS PhD or Masters, this is going to take the longest time and most money, but I've read mixed things about CS PhD not being very useful for job-searching.\n\nI am thinking that if I can somehow find a position that requires both health science and CS background, but I am not sure if there is a lot of position like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks.",

        "body": "A thought question to get the wisdom of the hive-mind.\nFirst imagine you are me, who has the following career so far.\n\nGoal: to continue in healthcare IT\n\n**Current fascination:** Elixir. Fascination is too weak to describe my passion for this language.\n\n**Background:**\n\n1. ~ 2 years: Angular, Python, AWS\n2. SaaS Startup (~ 3 years): React, Golang, K8S, GCP\n3. ~1 year: React, .NET Core, Azure\n\n**My Career Goal:** I want to continue working in healthcare with end-goal to be come CTO in the field or start a healthcare startup.\n\n**Next step Tech stack goal:** If possible I want to use Elixir.\n\n**My next career options:**\n\n1. Boss I used to work with asked me to join him for another LIS(Lab Information Systems) gig, Python shop. Boss is CTO. Another person I used to work with joined him as well. Boss is supportive in my goals. Lower end of target salary range.\n\n2. An Elixir gig in Healthcare, building EMR. Lower end of target salary. Been waiting on interview result for 2 months now..\n\n3. Healthcare startup. Python. Acquired by huge insurance company. Good target salary range. Coding project stage.\n\n4. Silicon Valley Healthcare startup. Vue and Java, by approaching someone working there by serendipity. VC funded Silicon Valley startup. Good target salary range. Didn't start interview process yet.\n\n5. Elixir based Silicon Valley Healthcare startup. Talked to recruiter, starting interview process. VC funded.\n\n\n**Question: What should be my next choice?**\n\nWhich one would you choose? What's the most correct one?\n\nFor me I currently chose option 5.\n\nReason #1:\n\nElixir is the main reason because I want to stretch how far Elixir can go, and would love to wrestle with the language under production settings. I'm a reckless dude, still unwise. Just want to get knee deep in tech I find love in. That's Elixir for now. It was Python, it was Golang, it still is React.. but having known Elixir other languages pale in interest.\n\nReason #2:\n\nI realized I'm itching to work in a startup again. I haven't worked in a Silicon Valley setting, so I'm interested to see what it'll be like working with \"top-class\" ppl is. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nSure if I choose option #1, then I'm gonna have a familiar work arrangement, which isn't bad. Boss promised to mentor me, which is also good.\n\nHowever it's a road I'm familiar with. Sure, business seems sound - it's disrupting an old infrastructure that is the lab industry in the USA, which means likelihood that it might do awesome things like IPO or getting acquired. CEO is with awesome track record.\n\nBut I don't think I'll be happy knowing I didn't do as much as possible to get option #5. I'm fixated on Elixir and I don't think I'll be happy not trying as much as possible to get an Elixir gig. And this is in healthcare, so it fits my goals perfectly.\n\nAs to why not option #2 - is because they were dragging the final decision for close to two months! I dunno but I'm losing confidence. Recruiter kept telling me to wait.\n\nI'm tight with the boss (from option #1) so I told him all this. He said he understood. He said to touch base further down the line - he also promised part time opportunities as I'd like to start a software agency on the side - if perhaps I don't get into the Option #5 and also boat sailed for the LIS gig (option #1).\n\nI think I made the right choice. \n\nBut wanted to double check with y'all.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I have been searching for a job since December (6 months), trying to apply for as many grad software dev roles as possible, however it has not been going great. \n\nI get mostly rejections. This is not that surprising in itself, I don't come from a quantitive background originally (I did film for my first degree) and I've obviously got to compete with BSc grads that have more programming experience. I know that some employers/software devs are a bit wary of people coming from my sort of background thinking that we are just chasing money/something trendy etc. but I really worked hard during my degree and I am(was) really passionate about programming. Before my MSc I was working a low level job where I could max out my hours in order to save up the money to support myself during my studies, before that I was a teacher. Maybe I don't have as a consistent background as other candidates. I would say I'm an average programmer for my experience level, competent enough but not a prodigy or anything like that. \n\nI'm not great at assessments. I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult and I tend to do poorly on timed assessments, when I see a timer I just tend to panic. I initially tried to offset this by spending all my time practicing coding challenges, I saw some improvement but recently I have been second guessing myself as I'm thinking I should be investing more time into stuff that is actually going to make me more employable (frameworks, new languages, projects). Last month I failed a take home that I put a lot of time into which was pretty deflating.\n\nDuring this past month, I find myself less and less enthusiastic about what I am doing and programming in general. I really tried my best to pursue this dream but I thinking that I'm probably just not good enough. I don't want this to be seen as a sob story, I just want some honest advice.",

Sorry in advance for the long, incoherent post with possibly dumb questions, I just feel a bit overwhelmed by everything!\n\nI am a second year Computer Science student and I'm loving it to absolute bits. And that's somewhat my problem, as I can't really decide what to chase.\n\nFirst of all, I have to say that my dream job is working in a research laboratory, helping further humanity's research (CERN, ESA, EHT or one of the many other telescope arrays, anything really). At least at one point in my life I wish to work somewhere like that: writing papers, collaborating with universities, all that good stuff.\n\n What is there most in demand there, what skills should I bring forth there? \n\nThe things I took the biggest liking in so far are artificial intelligence or data science and from what I've seen they are pretty used in this field. Also as an added bonus they seem to be pretty lucrative.\n\nSecond of all, I do later on want to get a bit more serious into game development, as I absolutely love it. I really wish at least once I could work at a big studio, on a big title on the technology behind it.\n\nMy plan so far is: study either AI, data science or some sort of applied computing at a Master's, apply to and work at different laboratories and work on games in my spare time; later on I wish to find a job at a big studio.\n\nMy questions thus are: \nIs this career path good / viable?\n\nHow do I even decide what to study at my Master's before knowing where I can use the knowledge? \n\nWhat else can I do to get into the large, important laboratories I've mentioned? I mean what to study, what to do in my spare time?\n\nI feel like I should mention I don't intend to move out of the EU at any point in the future.\n\nThank you so much and have an absolutely great day!",

        "title": "Like working in software but don't want to code? (IT Business Analyst)",
        "body": "I keep seeing a few posts here about people who come from a CS or engineering background but might want to transition away from fulltime programming. I wanted to explain my experience going from an engineer into a tech Business Analyst role.\n\nYou may have come across the title of an \u201cIT Business Analyst.\u201d Organizations seem to have vastly different definitions for this role. At some places, an It Business Analyst is analogous to a Product Manager. At other places, an IT Business Analyst is similar to a Systems Administrator. Hell, I\u2019ve seen some organizations use an IT Business Analyst as a sort of hodge podge role for DevOps (**raises hand**, it was me). I was working as an engineer when I decided I wanted a little less programming in my life, but I love tech too much so I didn't want to be fully removed from it. I applied for a \"Technical Business Analyst\" role that required some programming experience with product related skills. I was able to show the latter due to having been an unofficial scrum master and product owner at one of my companies. I'll stop there and go more into what this role even is:\n\n#### So what is an IT Business Analyst?\n\nLet\u2019s explore some potential definitions and job descriptions - then we can compare them and start to find the shared responsibilities. In general, a Business Analyst is responsible for carrying out research to help analyze business systems of some kind. Those systems might be an internal system used by an organization, for example SalesForce, or a system that is being developed and maintained by a company. A Business Analyst will be in charge of researching metrics such as user adoption, software performance, new software features, software support issues, user behavior, revenue generated, etc. Based off of those findings, the Business Analyst will often work with others to create an actionable plan to move metrics in a certain direction. \n\nDoes this all sound a little vague? That\u2019s because it is. Let\u2019s look at a few job descriptions pulled for open positions right now:\n\n>We are looking for an experienced Technology Business Analyst who has Salesforce Administration experience. You will perform a number of duties including providing general application support, serving as an important team member on a variety of different projects, and serving as an internal consultant to help optimize business processes that leverage the firm's business technologies. You will report to an Application Development Team Leader.\n\nSo this job seems to be aimed at a specific software platform - Salesforce. A different company might call this role a Salesforce Admin rather than an IT Business Analyst. \n\nLet\u2019s look at another:\n\n>The Sr. IT Business Analyst will need a blend of agile experience, business skills and experience that enables them to facilitate sessions with multiple stakeholders and prioritize work in the backlog to drive measurable results. This role will require impeccable organizational, time management, and communication skills, both oral and written.\n\nThis job is talking about prioritizing work in a backlog and measuring results. This falls right in line with Product Management descriptions. \n\nOkay, one more, this time from everyone\u2019s favorite interactive stationary bike company:\n\n>Peloton is seeking a Business Analyst to support a collaborative and proactive partnership between Enterprise Technology and the Retail business, acting both as a trusted business advocate and a key member of the IT team. Specifically this role will support the Retail Technology Leadership team. You will gather requirements and information across the organization and ensure follow up and updates are accurate and documented. You should feel comfortable analyzing, diagnosing and influencing IT process problems, while developing business requirements for strategic projects and new solutions.\n\nIn this one, we once more see a theme of gathering requirements, documenting IT processes in the hopes of creating new solutions. \n\nA Business Analyst has a lot of utility across different companies. In general, they seem to share the following job duties:\n\n* Researching of a business system or software\n* Working with users and exploring requirements for new solutions\n* Working between many groups like stakeholders, users, and engineers\n* Experts at a software product/service and can help troubleshoot support issues\n\nWhether a Business Analyst role is meant to work with proprietary software or vendor software, I think we\u2019re starting to get a good sense for what this role is even if different companies have a bit of a different take on it. \n\nI talk more about salary ranges and job experience [here](https://www.techcareerswithdiego.com/blog/what-is-an-it-business-analyst). \n\nA Business Analyst role really is a good option for those who like having their feet in tech roles while also operating more on the business side of an organization.",

        "body": "I basically have two offers, one is a contract position at a large, very well known company and the second is a full time position at a small company. The contract position has no end date but is (supposedly) long term because they're hiring a team for a new project they're rolling out. They'll handle the tax portion and I get PTO and holidays but no benefits but I can pay a fee and opt in with them if I want. The full time position is great and everything but their offices are located 1.5-2hrs from me, so 3-4hrs total back and forth. I mentioned this in one of the rounds and they said that I could work from home but come to the office like once a week.\n\nThis would be my first job and I was kind of excited to work in a nice office in the downtown area (which is close to where I live) but I won't be getting that with the full time position. The full time position seems great otherwise except for the fact that I would have to travel 3-4hrs once a week which I reeeeeeeally don't want to do. On the other hand is the big company which has offices in down town but it's a contract position which people seem to say isn't good when compared to full time.\n\nSo overall I'm kind of leaning more towards the contract position. I really don't want to commute 3-4hrs once a week and be in my home the other 4 days. I'm sure in a year or two I will take a remote position in a heart beat, but for now I was kind of looking forward to working in an office to see the experience for myself.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

Many hours, days of debugging followed. One coworker who developed for 13 years at the start of the project said that he can code the database, and have a program just spit out a diagram of how its structured after he creates it.\n\nIts ironic, and I realize I should appreciate the stuff I learned about System analysis and design in school.

I am in my mid 30s, and have been a developer for 7 years. I feel like I don't know anything. So many work hours are behind me but I feel like a complete failure. I am now doing reviews for juniors on my project and I can already see that they are better than me, faster than me. So I really don't think this is an imposter syndrome, it's reality in my case.  \n  \n\nIs this \"just\" burnout? I got fired from my previous job because of projects ending and the company laid off almost 200 people. You can't say I was fired because of my mistakes and wrongdoings, but if I had been a good programmer, I know they wouldn't have let me go so easily as they did not let go of other colleagues. On that day, I left work with my belongings and a big fat smile on my face. I was happy I got fired because I felt miserable at the end as I am feeling now, if not worse.  \n   \n\nIt was hard at the beginning when I just started out, but I always thought it would get easier. I don't think I can continue working like this with long hours because I couldn't come up with a solutions in the time given and I just don't have the capacity to process new information and technologies as I did before. I am getting old and really really unhappy. And I don't want to harm my company. They've been good to me, and I should be doing everything I can to deliver good-quality work.  \n    \nI'm thinking about going to see a doctor to get a prescription for add/adhd medication. I have never been diagnosed and I know it's basically amphetamines. I am a responsible person who wants to live a healthy life. I've never used drugs in my life.

It's not even that learning itself is uninteresting to me, I love learning.\n\nBut like for example I'm subscribed to a guy on YT who just uploaded \"*why container queries will be a gamechanger*\" and sure I wanna know what CSS container queries are and why they are a gamechanger, but I feel so resistant towards just clicking on the video and watching it to know.\n\nIt's almost like I half don't want to know because it'll give me anxiety about another new way to write CSS and that I'll be behind on this part of my knowledge set if I don't master it as well as all the previous stuff I've learned up till now, but also if I don't learn it at all the same thing will happen.

The interviewer even said i have no clue why they have you listed as a Junior , and did not even ask me the rest of the questions they had lined up because he mentioned \"i know you know them\".\n\nThe interview consisted of development cycle, problem solving skills and my background. Some insight on the ranking there , it's Intern, Junior Engineer, Engineer 1, Engineer 2 , Lead Engineer, Etc.\n\nNow the reason i have major Imposter Syndrome is because i feel like they are over reaching, and i'm more the type of expect less - produce more. I feel like if i was an Engineer 1 , they would not expect so much from me and i would be able to produce more work vs Eng 2 maybe my work will equal out to barely enough.\n\nI have no clue and this post might be a mess but so am i right now. I've spoken with employee's there who are all REALLY friendly and have mentioned that the company is more about learning. Maybe i am overthinking it? What should i do ? Im trying to learn as much tech as i can before i enter the role as i have not started but don't want to over think and burn out before even starting.\n\nAny tips?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: \n\nForgot to mention the original salary offered when speaking with a recruiter for Eng1 was 50k , after being moved to Eng2 i was bumped to 80k and that is what i signed for.

I'm at the end of my first week, and working remotely due to COVID.  \nThe first thing I want to mention is that the program we followed was in a particular programming language and we mainly focussed on that.  We got an internship that uses another language so it required a bit of preparation on my part to get started and in no means I'm fluent in it.   \n\n\nMe and the other intern each got our own project to work on. The first day was a disaster imo, our internmentor (who is the one who founded the company) went over all these systems in lightning speed, making us feel very overwhelmed. The next day I decided to take it step by step for my project and just ask questions when I'm really stuck. This means that for the past week I've been looking up all the information I can on the systems and frameworks and API's we use, I went through the code (which is written so damn difficult I don't even understand 5% of it) and started my project.   \n\n\nI'm a very communicative person and during this first week I've been TRYING to contact my mentor on what I need to proceed along with some questions. Except for the one time I got an occassional dry 'i made this and here is the password', I haven't heard decently from him since Tuesday.  Yesterday I got an email where he said that the protocol I was using wasn't very secure and he said it would be better to use a certain API but that was out-of-scope for now(thats all the email said). I answered him and asked some questions, but haven't received a reply yet. Then I saw that he does have time for the other intern to arrange meetings and answering his questions on the platform we're using. I asked today again for a meeting with my mentor because I also have questions (my questions on the platform are unanswered btw). I feel like I'm getting ignored, while the other intern is getting all the support he needs. Maybe it's me, but I feel like I have been reaching out and have been doing my best. I learn a lot of things on my own, but I'm stuck and could use some guidance, but this seems to get ignored.   \n\n\nTo be honest I already made the decision in my mind that if my mentor doesn't answer this call for my meeting, I will ask the school what I should do, because this can't be a decent internship if they just leave me be and give no support at all. I already knew beginning as a developer is hard, and you can't be productive in the first few months, but I didn't expect this. Is this normal, are my expectations too high?",

Unfortunately that wasn't enough to get into any of the MSCS programs I applied to so I'm trying to apply to SWE jobs but it's a tough sell with a mech bachelors and only academic internships. Luckily I have two offers though and I'm trying to find out which one is better for me, I would like to work with ML for the foreseeable future.\n\n1. \"**Software Engineer, ML**\" at large company, through staffing agency :(\n\n* TC: 80K\n* **pros:** actual ML work, in the areas I enjoy. Large company with good name recognition. Would be using pytorch, SQL, AWS every day.\n* **cons:** I would be paid by a staffing agency and it's only a 1 year contract (with potential FTE conversion), not a big issue because the pay isn't great and I would just be doing it to kickstart my ML career.\n\n1. \"**SWE New Grad**\" at start-up (\\~80 ppl)\n\n* TC: 90K base + equity (no idea how much this will be worth)\n* Team seems great but they don't really have major ML operations going on yet. They use React & typescript.\n* **pros**: Seems like a great environment, more mentorship, flexibility to work on different projects\n* **cons:** they are interested in ML but don't have much set up yet, most of the job would probably be full-stack development.\n\nI think I'm going to apply to the online MSCS from UT Austin and try to do that over the next few years. The ML contract position would be great but I'm hesitant about how working for a staffing agency will look on my resume. Since I'd really be working for this big company, would I even need to mention that I'm at the staffing agency on my resume/linkedin? Can I list the big company as the actual employer and mention it was a contract in the bullet points?\n\nIf I go for the startup I could always try to pivot later but would it be harder to switch to an ML job later on?\n\nWhat would you do if you were in my shoes? any advice?",

Having gone through a bootcamp via Zoom during COVID, it was beneficial in someways, but ultimately, outside of my comfort zone of learning. I KNOW I can learn how to code. However, I am a hands-on learner in the sense that when I make mistakes or if I don't understand something, having a person to go to for questions or guidance is crucial. I do NOT want to limit myself, however, I do feel like I hit a brick wall when it comes to understanding documentation. I know I'm not the only one who feels this, but I am concerned that I will not get a job due to my level of understanding. But I KNOW with a team/mentor and given enough time, I can learn what the job requires of me. It's just getting there.  \n\n\n**Question 1:** Are there apprenticeship programs for software developers? I have come across anything of the sort. A company called Revature does something close to it, but not applicable for my situation.   \n\n\n**Question 2:** In the bigger picture, I honestly went the path of developing to eventually step into a different role down the road. Positions like Product Management or Technical PM are very appealing to me and I wonder how else I can reach those positions if I am unable to find success as a software developer?",

As far as SOME experience goes, I have \"mentored\" a 10-year old for five months on coding and some robotics, along with four months of front-end web design for a non-profit museum. Everyone I have spoken to said I should apply to places elsewhere before I stick with Revature, but I am having trouble turning away their offer on fear of not getting another job. Should I stick with it or stay far away?",

        "body": "(I'm still a student without much experience in the industry. Do not mistake the contents of this post for an educated description of the job market. Just asking questions.)\n\nWhen looking at SW developer job ads online, I noticed a pattern: usually there is one main subject in which proficiency is required (for example, obviously a front-end developer should be good at front-end stuff) and a side subject that is \"nice to have\" (for example a front-end developer should also know a little about back-end). I've seen many combinations of these kinds of main and side subjects, however I have NEVER seen a job offer that had embedded systems programming as a side subject. All the job ads containing the word \"embedded\" I looked at went in all the way, usually even preferring hardware-oriented degrees (EE and CE) over CS. Am I just searching for the wrong jobs, or are jobs who combine embedded systems programming with a specialization in a high-level subject really that rare?\n\nI would have expected that many engineering companies are looking for developers who combine good skills in algorithmic/mathematical fields like ML, image processing or numerical analysis with a little knowledge about embedded systems programming to help the EEs get these functionalities onto the system. But I only find it the other way around: job offers for EEs/CEs specialized in embedded systems programming, sometimes with a preference for some algorithmic/mathematical knowledge on the side. Maybe this is because the EEs/CEs already know a lot of math and CS anyway?\n\nThe reason I am asking is because I am a student who has so far specialized in the aforementioned algorithmic/mathematical fields, but has taken only very basic courses on computer architecture and none on EE. I am planning to learn about embedded systems programming in the next months because it sounds interesting, but would like to know if someone like me should treat this like a side hobby or a realistic career option.\n\nI hope the question is clear and look forward to your answers.\n\nTL;DR: How is the job market for people who specialize in higher-level fields like ML or image processing and also have some knowledge about embedded systems programming?",

Apparently, the company considers this pay rate at the \"senior\" level (even though the salary I make is no where near some of the TCs you see on this board even for new grads, not even close). The work they do is mostly contract based, billed to the client on a time and materials basis.  The consequence of this is that the company quotes the client a certain $ amount for the project (broken down on a task-by-task basis) and then presumably once the contract is signed we can't just go back and ask for more money.  This translates to a fixed number of hours available to \"bill\" toward the project.\n\nWe need to fill out time sheets and mark the hours worked in meticulous detail (e.g. on Monday I worked 3 hours on project A, 5 hours on project B, etc).  The issue is that a developer is assigned a particular task, which has a pre-determined number of hours allocated to it.  The number of hours for the task is essentially calculated as the $ amount quoted for the particular task / the pay rate of the developer.  Keep in mind in some cases this $ amount quoted may have occurred over a year prior to the start of the task.  The pay rate of the developer literally depends on who is working on the task.  This means that since I am at the \"senior\" level, I get fewer hours allocated toward the task than would a junior dev that is hired at the \"junior\" level on the SAME task.\n\nThe number of hours allocated are (in my opinion) ridiculously low.  For example, a change requiring modification of over 35 source code files (including the code itself, database upgrade scripts, unit tests, UI files, schema updates, and the works) was assigned as 65 hours to me.  Then, even if I get a working solution, the senior devs / project leads will come back and tell me to do it a different way, requiring another round of changes and testing.  Not surprisingly, I am extremely stressed in that as a new developer I'm expected to complete these tasks in a MASSIVE code base that I have no prior experience with, or any real experience working in production code.  I've been at this for \\~3 months now and I'm actually surprised I've even gotten as far as I have given my experience level.  I find myself working on personal time and not billing (nights and weekends) just to try to come close to the allocated hour amount.  I'm burning out quickly and find this very unfair.  My stress levels are through the roof and it's affecting my personal life and relationships as well.\n\nThe people I work with are generally very nice and are willing to help, but it doesn't solve the fundamental issue of not being able to complete these (IMO, rather massive) tasks in a tiny number of hours.  There are (unspecified) consequences for going \"over budget\".  I'm thinking it's only a matter of time before getting fired.\n\nMy fundamental question to the community is: is this normal?  If not, what should I do?",

I know its essential to focus on data structures and algorithms but I'm not sure how I can create a tangible project with it at this stage. Also all students in my batch will be taking couple of courses on this in 2nd year so I feel like I won't be able to stand out.",

I was able to do leetcode easies comfortably and handful of mediums.\n\n2019-2021 - worked almost 2 years at same company. covid was rough but still had job. barely any raises though so my salary is pretty much the same.

I tried not to put extra hours outside of work but when it was work hours, I did focus and do my best to learn and provide value.

I didn't filter my job applications as I really needed income and I am in my final year of university so I don't really have much levarage. While searching I found a really good place which I really liked. The problem though was that they required  strong C++ experience which I don't have. In fact it is the only major language I have never touched in my life.  This putted me off a bit but I told myself whatever and I just applied to it.\n\nFunnily enough, I receive coding questions from them. I couldn't really finish some of them and I was about to give up and just go and eat something. I decided to write how my approach would be as comments on the coding questions and hoped fo the best. Despite my expectations, I had 2 rounds of interviews and eventually they offered me the job. They told me that they valued general OOP\\* skills more than knowing the language itself.\n\nI didn't have much success with Java, the language I have done most of my uni work and with which I have 3 personal projects . Had I just said \"There is no point, they won't want me as I have no c++ experience\" I might have not had a job right now.\n\nAnother non-cs related example is when I was looking for accomodation where the job is located. The room looked great but it said it is only for women. I decided to contact the landlord anyway and she said that she can make an exception as long as I am respectful and clean. Again, had I said \"No way, the room is women only\" I wouldn't have taken the room.\n\nAgain, this doesn't mean that you shouldn't make informative choices on how to where to invest your time but there are many branching paths which just cannot be seen or taken account of.\n\nThanks for reading and have a nice day!",

But my only concern / question is, how good would this look on a resume vs working on a feature (albeit small) on a product that has actual users? I hear \"quantifying\" your accomplishments on a resume is very important, but I don't know how that would work on an open source project (e.g \"Created and published an open-source project fixing problem X with Y users\" vs \"decreasing latency times by X% on our production system\".\n\nAs a software developer hiring manager, what do you like more? Idk if this changes anything but I'm looking to apply to bigger (FAANG-ish level) companies for my next internship.",

But now after work, i would feel burnout but it just seems gets worse everyday.\n\nI am thinking of leaving this job since a year ago and wanting to do something else for my career (doing software engineering work in another company or industry, or maybe starting a small business). And during the break, i would probably use the time to first of all enjoy the NOW and stop feeling too anxious about the future, and brush up my skills as well as learning new skills like learning modern web frameworks and such. Maybe start to look for a new job after i feel better about myself and have a fresh mindset.\n\nI have about a year worth of my monthly salary saved up in my bank account, as well as some other liquid assets in some stocks, robo advisor, etc. My expenses are pretty low as I'm living with my family for the past year due to the pandemic.\n\nTL;DR: Burned out from work, and feeling depressed lately. Wanting to quit the job and take a break for some time to de stress and re-calibrate myself. \n\nSo what do you guys think? Should i quit my job now and take a break for 1-3 months? \n\nOr anyone with similar experience can share their thoughts here.",

Was not given any mentoship opportunity although I asked about it as most incoming new teammates differ in skillsets (more research-ish, less engineering).\n- Most work were done either cross-functional on my own, or new initiatives that I need to promote but dies out eventually as teammates do not seem to pick them up.\n\nI recently got an invitation to the first phone screen interview from one of the big N company. As I don't live in the US, this is somewhat a big opportunity to work with some of the greatest engineers. While the job scope and technical skills are somewhat relevant, I don't feel I am experienced technically enough to handle them, as I was handling a breadth of exploration and integration work + testing at my current company. That means I know a little bit of mobile, web, and product big picture instead of being a algo specialist. More often than not, I tried to be the person that helps communicating why a certain implementation might not work in other department's perspective, instead of solving a hard research problem. While I understand how some of these problems were solved in my company, I could not take credit as I am not the one that personally sat down and worked on it.\n\nI also lacked mentorship leading experience that they emphasized as most of my work were integration and debugging work where I explain the problem and walk through the codebase with them, and propose the fix, instead of a back and forth discussion (although I was still involved in some of the discussion unofficially).\n\nI feel that my other teammate felt more like a perfect fit, with deeper specialist skill and mentorship experience, and was a little disappointed to not be screened (we didn't apply, this was a linkedin recruiter). I feel that I am simply just not ready yet and thinking of referring to that teammate instead. Is that a right thing to do socially? Or do I just have imposter syndrome and downplaying my experience?\n\nI feel that I am in a career crossroad where I may be stuck not improving if i continue to stay (missed opportunities), and also not able to get the experience that I want because I do not have that in my current tenure, or perhaps I'm just not good enough to go to the next stage until I pick up the things that I need to know on my own.

The team that is working on the same project as me are all in Europe (10 hour time difference), so I'm pretty much alone during my working hours since their day ends when mine starts. My. first week was overwhelming and I cried every day on the drive to work. I wanted to quit after a month, but decided to give it a year. Well, it's been a year and I still feel awful. I know I'm very lucky to have a job during these times and I'm truly grateful. But the feeling of isolation, not fitting in with the team, and that I'm not learning/growing fast is leaving me anxious and depressed. Like a dark cloud that hangs over me. I've started going to therapy in hopes that I can feel the drive and happiness I felt before I started working here. It's been difficult to find joy in the activities I used to enjoy.I hear my roommate often on zoom with coworkers in their time zone and it makes me a bit jealous. I don't really have anyone to talk to during the day. Sometimes I have a great idea for our project or have a question, but there's no one to message on Slack or Zoom with. Well, I can shoot an email and will hear back the following day or two. I feel like this is slowing my growth as an SE. But maybe I am just overreacting? Are all you new grads thriving in remote work environments?\n\nI've tried changing my work hours to Europe time but it left me really tired and I couldn't adjust. Maybe I am the problem and I'm just not competent enough to be in this field, I should be able to thrive in this role right? Or maybe I need to switch companies?

We are understaffed with 5 developers doing work for a relatively large company. 1 dev in charge of email newsletter templates, 1 in charge of pagination of websites, 1 in charge of specific content of pages (for ex: article pages), 1 in charge on mobile apps, something entirely different than what the rest of the team is working on, 1 who's a fullstack dev and who is also our team manager. He recently got promoted to be our manager so he has no idea about my official position. And then there's me, who works on all the other tasks that don't have a category.\n\nI started as an Intern with no title, and started learning on the job as a web developer. I was working with email newsletter templates, and learned the ropes pretty quickly. Only one dev is in charge of the newsletters, and ever since I joined then, it gave him room to breathe. He and our project manager had a lot of praise for me even though I felt like this part of the job was on the easier and smaller scale, but I took the recognition as a good sign of course.\n\nAfter the internship was over, they offered me a full time position as a Jr. Front-End Engineer, and this is where my growth really began and I've learned a whole bunch of skills. I moved on to bigger projects with website maintenance/redesigns and have definitely grew as a developer.\n\nWell long story short, I think that I've become a valuable asset to the team and I wasn't sure if I could ask for a much higher salary. Of course I'm looking to be promoted but I don't know how much more they would give me realistically.\n\nMy offer was $52k annually, and I accepted it right away without counter-offering because I was afraid of losing this opportunity. But now that I've gained more experience and I'm comfortable with what's thrown at me, I'm seeking for a higher reward, and not just a 5k-10k increase. I'm looking for at least $80k, or hell maybe even $75k. But my problem is that this is a HUGE jump from $52k, and I'm not sure how to bring this up.\n\nI know that I'm a valuable asset to the company because we are understaffed, so without me, they will definitely be flooded with work. I'm also the backup dev for the email newsletters too, so the main newsletter dev will have no back-up dev since I'm the only other person who knows how to work with them.\n\nAnother problem is, I don't really have an assigned \"role\" before my request. Each dev has their own role as listed above, but I work on many tasks that aren't really specific, although they are not minor. I was wondering if this would affect my request.\n\nAll in all, my main problem is how to approach requesting for a promotion with a wage from $52k to a massive jump of $80k. I do wish to stay in the company if I can, I don't want to leave them shorthanded, but I also don't want to go into the job hunting phase again.\n\nThank you for reading my long post, I appreciate any guidance!",

I have read that taking a DevOps position as a new grad can run the risk of pigeonholing my career and make it harder to transition to a SWE. Is this a legitimate concern? I only plan on staying at either company for 1 or 2 years and then leaving for something else. **Would 1-2 years of DevOps experience out of university instead of SWE experience really hinder my career growth as a SWE?**\n\n2.

        "body": "Using a burner account. \n\nI graduated this May and I started applying to jobs back in February. I was getting very few interviews. Maybe 1% response rate as I have 0 experience. \n\nI added a couple projects to my resume and my response rate increased slightly, maybe about 2-3%. At this point, I was struggling with technical interviews so I tried getting into Leetcode and it was just so stressful. I felt like I didn\u2019t know anything and I didn\u2019t even wanna try anymore. I just wanted to give up. \n\nHowever, after talking to a family friend who\u2019s a senior software engineer, she told me to focus only on Strings and Arrays on Leetcode. I took her advice and only solved questions that were tagged either \u2018String\u2019 or \u2018Array\u2019.  That was life-changing advice for me. I went through many technical interviews and EVERY SINGLE QUESTION I was ever asked either involved strings or arrays. Mainly arrays. \n\nEventually after going through many interviews and over 400 applications, I finally got an offer (65,000, Low COL). \n\nMy advice if you\u2019re in a similar situation, add projects to your resume with good descriptions (I had 4), and be prepared to talk about them a lot in an interview. That\u2019s the only way to show you have experience coding without an internship. And when it comes to Leetcode, don\u2019t get discouraged. Just focus on Arrays and Strings. Eventually you spot patterns and implement them. Talk your way through technical interviews and be confident.\n\nEdit: I had 4 projects on my resume. My senior design project, a big project I did for my game development class, a very small app that I made on the side, and a school project that was a basic compiler.",

Second one is actually for a JR front-end dev role that I'm interviewing for right now, so at least I have that.\n\nBut the rest of my applications have been getting rejected or haven't gotten any responses to and I honestly don't know why. Now I don't have any previous professional software experience (did an IT internship a while back and that's it, no programming involved with it), but I've been doing almost everything else from adding personal projects, uploading them on GitHub, created an online portfolio, etc. Also I've been sending cover letters but only to those that require one.\n\nIf you guys can take the time, I posted my resume below that I've been using and I'd like some feedback on it just to see if it's the main thing holding me back. I included 4 projects on it and tried to describe them as good as i can. Idk if the ATS just keeps rejecting my resume based on format but I'm pretty sure it's not because I already submitted mine for review and the layout seems to be the ideal format for ATS (again would like some feedback on this). if you think i need more projects (or more complicated ones) please let me know. Any help is good for me.\n\nI'm really starting to think it's impossible to get a developer job with no experience unless I network at this point. Anyone else here feel the same way? I understand getting rejected from roles that require 2-3 years of experience but i'm getting rejected from internships and that's what's really concerning me.

Currently have an offer from an Electrical Engineering start up in my local area that seems to have pitched a good offer my way but I was hoping to receive some input from more experienced individuals. I recently graduated from a smaller university with a 3.6 GPA with a degree in CS and will finish my bachelors in computational mathematics this summer. I have two years tutoring  CS experience and a year long Automation Engineer Internship.\n\nThe Job Duties: Control System Integration, Power System Integration,  HMI & PLC Programming, and SCADA Development and Design. I was told I will be involved in every stage of the process from actually designing and building the control systems to programming the  HMI & PLC systems. (To me this seems like a more computer engineering position, which I personally have no problem with however I would like to make sure it is good experience). \n\nSome of the pros include: There is only two individuals at the company both of which are extremely nice and down to earth individuals (one is a P.E in electrical engineering with 15+ years of industry experience (the owner) and the others has a masters in enterprise systems that has been with the company 3 years), the company has been around 4 years and is expanding due to getting more private sector and government contracts (My initial thoughts are that they seem like a qaulity company with quality products).  I would be able to work with tools (big plus for me as I am a hands on type of guy), and I already feel like I could be friends with the other two workers. For logistics they also gave me an above average starting salary for my state for entry level computer science grads, 18 paid days off, medical insurance, free continuing education classes through Rockwell Automation, free classes to eventually take the Fundamentals of engineering exam (F.E) (which the company will also pay for), and the chance to work under a P.E and eventually take the P.E exam at no cost to myself. One thing to note is Computer Science jobs are also somewhat scarce in my area. The owner also discussed the possibility of part ownership down the line and the final point I can think of is that they mentioned that I could work overtime if I would like, however it is optional. \n\nSome of the cons include: The main thing I see here is how applicable this is to CS. Is there concerns if all of my job doesn't involve code? In addition the company is a start up so the company could boom or bust, however I am young and have no one to look out for other than myself. I mainly just want to make sure I can gain some more experience.\n\nWould this be a good entry level job if I don't have any other offers?",

It kind of feels like trying to clean a very messy room and moving around all over the room picking things up but not really seeing it get any cleaner, and not knowing which part of the room to focus on first.\n\nAny advice on how I should be spreading my time on these various areas (assuming they're all genuinely useful for job search)?

I am getting a really good salary but I feel that this career is a dead end mainly because I am not enjoying it that much now as compared to the first couple of years.\n\nWhen covid happened I got pulled out from the field  and started working in the office full time. This gave me a lot of free time because I now only work 35 hours per week. I am very interested about software development in general and i started learning web development. After almost a year I have a firm grasp in creating front and back end projects.\n\nMy plans for next year is to move in with my girlfriend in the US. I have two routes that I am looking at currently: study in the US (master's in computer science) or apply for web development jobs.\n\nThe con for the first option is financial. Studying in the US is stupidly expensive. I have been researching a lot about scholarship grants and aids but  the competition in getting these is really off the charts. And on top of that I will be a foreign student so I will have more things to prepare like getting a student visa.\n\nThe second option is even more difficult because I don't have professional experience in the web development world yet. And there is the thing about getting work visa too.\n\nIs there anyone out there that is going through the same thing as me? Please share your experiences and opinions.",

I figured I was dead in the water and explored other roles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI then accepted a different position with a 20+% pay increase from my first job and was ecstatic, feeling my hard work paid off.

        "body": "Hey guys,  \n\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nThe company that I'm currently working for is moving towards using a software called Let's Deel ([https://www.letsdeel.com/](https://www.letsdeel.com/)) for all contractors. I found some privacy and security issues within their software and raised these concerns to HR. The answer from Deel is that they will not budge on any of these issues. Raising this to HR and asking for an alternative, we were essentially given an ultimatum. We either accept this or we find another place of employment. \n\n**What would you do in my situation? Stay and accept buggy software that could potentially leak my passport, personal identifiable information including tax and contract information, as well as bank account information, or resign? Note that I can easily find another job for equal or higher pay, but I like the work that I currently do and I like my team.**  \n\n\n**Full story;**  \nThere are several problems with Deel's software as well as their stance on privacy and security.   \n\n\n**Security issues:**\n\n* Upon logging in to [letsdeel.com](https://letsdeel.com), there is a series of warnings and errors being logged to the console. In one of these, **my password is being logged to the console in clear text**. \n* Upon inspecting the network, I can see various packets being sent, one of which has a JSON with all of my information, personal and contractual, in it, including my email, salary, currency, scope of work, full name, Deel ID, which seems like an internal UUID that is also used in forming the URL of my contract and may be useful in hacking in, the company's information, as well as our HR reps' information.\n* Also within the network, you can see that **this highly sensitive form is also being served JS from over a dozen third parties**, including: Calendly, Stripe, GTM, Google Analytics, Google Lead Services, Cookie Bot, LMS analytics, Bing, Reddit, LR Injest, LinkedIn Ads, Ad Symptomatic, Intercom, among others. If any one of these services gets hacked, then someone can put in a keylogger in JS and easily get all of our information, taking personal, tax, and banking information with them. Best practice for login pages, checkout pages, or any other page with highly sensitive information is to remove all 3rd party JS to prevent this sort of attack.\n* Having read through the terms of service, point 4.2 states that **\"Deel will not be liable for any losses or damage arising from unauthorized use of your account or password\"**. Meaning that they have some really poor security and if we sign on to their services, they offer no guarantee that they will protect us as their clients in the event of a breach.  \n\n* A further demo from a Deel representative showed us even further bugs in their software, giving me much less confidence that they would be able to handle sensitive information carefully.  \n\n\n**Privacy Issues:**\n\nWe are a company based in the EU and I take GDPR legislation and my right to privacy pretty seriously. Having said that, Deel is a US based company. \n\nIn their states, \"If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that **we transfer the information, including your Personal Information, to the United States and process it there**.Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such Personal Information represents your agreement to that transfer.\"\n\nThey have all of this information hidden in the privacy policy instead of clearly stating it within the contract.  \n\n\n**Final question:**\n\nAs I have noted these issues to a VP at Deel, they have no interest in fixing their buggy software. HR wants everyone to shut up and sign. I have contacted our CTO and anyone else in the company that I think would understand, and while they agree, they are just sitting on their hands about it. Should I simply move on at this point? I'm not sure where else to turn.  \n\n\n  \nThanks!\n\n\\- Not My Real Name",

        "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a soon-to-be grad and I just received and accepted my first job offer as a software developer. However, the company I currently work for has offered me a counter offer that includes being promoted to their development team. I am having trouble deciding which one I should go with.\n\nAfter negotiating with the two companies, they have arrived at what are very comparable offers. Most of the compensation and benefits would be the same for me regardless of the choice. This leaves me with the culture and the nature of the work to decide on, and I can't decide on the better opportunity.\n\nI have worked with the team at my current company for a couple of months now. I love the leadership of the development team and have been hoping to join them basically since I started working here. However, it is a relatively small team and they do not seem to have a \"normal\" structure for the industry (if that necessarily exists). It would be mostly web development and I feel like there is a ceiling that I could reach here. The development team here is also fully remote and that is something I have wanted.\n\nAs for the new company, it is a tech startup and I have not worked there so it is difficult to gauge the culture, but the person I would be working under is VERY knowledgeable and I feel like there is a lot to learn from him. I would be working with a similar framework, but it would be much more challenging and would push me to my limit. I also feel like it would help me grow as a developer way more than my current company due to the challenge, on top of it being in the tech industry. However, it would only be remote temporarily through COVID. I would be working remote at least until the end of the year, but I would eventually have to make a decent commute.\n\nAny advice is helpful. I'm unaware of the long term weight of learning in a challenging environment in this industry or how far web development experience will take me.",

        "title": "career advice for mid-level c++ applications dev?",
        "body": "Hello everyone!\n\nI have roughly three years of experience as a C++ applications dev. All of this has been at a single company where I work on a very large (several million LOC) codebase. The program targets Mac and Windows, and I have written a small amount of platform-specific code for each. Performance is very important, as some of our customers work with very large files, so I have done a moderate amount of profiling and optimization. I would describe my experience so far as \"generalist\". I have worked on many different parts of the project, which required me to understand unfamiliar code quickly, but I haven't developed expertise in any specific area (outside of code I wrote myself) because I work on so much different stuff.\n\nAnyways, my current job isn't a bad one. The pay is decent, I like my coworkers, the work-life balance is good, etc. But I just don't care very much about the domain; I find the whole problem space very boring. I feel this limits my ability to truly understand the customers' needs, and especially in the last six months, my growing apathy has probably affected my performance. I know if I set my mind to it, I can push through this, but I am also questioning the value of the experience I am building. A lot of it is specific to this niche, and more generally, the desktop C++ application appears to be going extinct.\n\nSo where do I go from here? When I look on Glassdoor or AngelList, most of the postings seem to be for backend/fullstack/devops positions and expect experience with a bunch of technologies I've never even heard of, let alone understand. I figure the best thing I've got going for me are my strong C++ skills, but these kinds of roles tend to also expect a lot of experience I don't have (linux, embedded, firmware/drivers, etc.).\n\nIdeally I'd like to find a role where the work is more interesting to me. I'm very into hardware (I do a lot of PC builds, overclocking, and gaming in my spare time), and I've enjoyed the few opportunities I've had so far to really dig into a piece of code and optimize it. I particularly enjoyed my OS and Architecture courses in college. But ultimately I'd settle for anything that increases the options I have for my career in the future.

Below is a summary of how my resume/abilities look like:\n\n* rising junior (GPA 3.7+)\n* Graduating in three years with three majors (CS + Applied Math + Cognitive Science) (had to graduate early due to financial reasons)\n* have nothing done besides one web project in node.js; no leetcode practice, no other impressive personal projects yet (but am planning on improving these starting this summer)\n* three-month-long internship in finance is the only internship experience I have --> no tech internship\n* Have two semesters left till (early) graduation (I only have about 20 credits left to fulfill, so the two semesters that are left will be pretty chill --> lots of time to work on interview practices/portfolio)\n* decently interested in NLP that I'm willing to stay at school for extra 2-3 semesters for a masters in NLP\n\nMy goal is to land at one of the **big tech** companies so that I can apply for **green card** asap. Following are the two options I have in terms of graduation and getting a job: \n\n**1)** graduate early (in three years) as planned, but take one semester off before graduation so that I can get some internship experience in my home country + work on personal projects and leetcode, \n*OR* **2)** graduate in 4 years like everyone else and get internship experience in the US + a concurrent masters\n\nIf I choose to follow option 1, then I would have more time to work on my personal projects and leetcode while *still* getting some internship experience (which I heard is important when trying to get a job), but I wouldn't be able to do an internship in the states at big companies like my classmates do (due to visa issues). \n\nIf I choose option 2, then I *would* be able to do an internship in the states (which def would be a plus for jobs), but I would have to stay at school for two to three more semesters for a degree that I'm not 100% sure I need/want. But I guess even if I do the master's I'll still graduate in four years, so not much I'm losing here, except money. (I have an external scholarship lined up that would partially fund me through my master's, but it would still hurt me a lot financially)\n\nHere are some questions I have:\n\n1. Does any of you know if non-US internships (most likely at a start-up) \"count\" at all and hold similar significance as internships at big companies in the US?\n\n2. Is it realistic to think that I can get an offer at big tech without an internship in the US but with a great portfolio of personal projects and interview performance (+ decent GPA at a top 10 school + referral)? Or should I be safe and just follow the traditional route of doing an internship and graduating in four years?\n\n3. Any advice?\n\nI'm desperate for any advice and help. Please let me know if you need more info on my situation. Thank you!",

Throughout school I was an overachiever and have lots of internship experience. But now that I've graduated school and I've achieved everything that I've been working hard for, I've realized that maybe coding 90% of the day isn't for me.

I would spend most of the time planning the layout and picking out the aesthetics of the website and then quickly write up the scripts and backend portion. I feel very strongly that UX design is more suited for me.\n\nInitially, I was looking into Masters programs in User Experience or Human Technology Interaction. But I remember how difficult it was finishing up my bachelors degree while working fulltime and I'm not sure if I could sustain that for 2-4 more years. So I started looking into Bootcamps, that are much cheaper ($6000 - $15000)  and last between 5 - 9 months if I were to go part-time. But I know a lot of these bootcamps are sold to people who don't have any sort of Product Development background, so I'm not sure if that would look unusual to see someone with a CIS degree have a UX bootcamp certificate on their resume. I've tried self teaching myself UX tools/concepts, but I'm not sure I'll be able to get myself job ready all with self-directed learning.\n\nI feel like the benefits of going to a bootcamp would be that I would get help learning these concepts more deeply, while also building up a tangible portfolio that I can show potential employers, and I'll get career coaching that'll help me through this transition. I just want to be sure that before I commit to this that I'll have a strong chance of actually becoming employed after and that its worth all of the time and effort put into it.\n\nHas anyone gone through a similar career transition / know a friend or colleague that took a similar path?

But is it really good for juniors growth? I've often told at least on my work that senior are good at what they do because they learn from experience. Now if we told juniors to just follow orders because its best, are they not being rob of good learning experience? On why do things this way? Books like clean architecture explains things but very different from learning by mistake. Or like explaining that business logic should be this way and that way but did not experience first hand on to why should be that way. We can be good following and reading books but I feel like when it comes to explaining why, we can't answer. I don't know.

I understand the reasoning behind this, although I believe I still prefer to have 1 or 2 days per week at the office. Anyway, I was wondering if WfH could take some jobs from HCOL areas to LCOL in the US since it is much cheaper to hire someone in Nebraska than in the Bay Area for example. I understand that there are certain challenges regarding the formalities (taxes, work contract, blabla) but it seems like a win-win situation for the company and the remote employee.\n\nNow, the real question is how long would it take for those companies to start looking outside the US? If the agreement is that WfH is as efficient as working at the office, maybe companies could hire people from outside for a fraction of the salary. A counter argument could be that developers in the US are better (that is a different discussion), but are they 3-5 times better?\n\nI am actually an engineer in Europe and I have started to see this trend in the US to allow WfH as a big opportunity in the future to penetrate the American market.

I was a web development student but got an internship in data analytics just on the basis of a few riddles, mental ability questions and a good HR round...Let's just say I got lucky...\nThere's a rule in our college that doesn't let you sit for further campus placements once you've been selected for 1 particular company...So I had to take it up...the salary was pretty good so I thought how bad could it really be....I just felt lucky to find a job in these trying times of covid\nSince it started and they began training us in excel I knew it was not for me...it's been almost 3 months and I still haven't been able to feel better better about it. I am the only intern who is not familiar with any data analytics technologies. I don't see myself doing this job even in the next 2 years and feel like it's not for me.Sometimes when you know, you just know... After 2 months, I was put into a team that requires quick logical reasoning and good math and I suck at both of them. I am a visual and a creative person and find data analytics boring and hard. I am not excited to learn. Maybe something like Ui/Ux would have been ideal for me and I'm thinking about transitioning into it as soon as this internship is over through a course or a postgraduate program because I am not very bright at coding...but this internship is making me doubt myself every step of the way whether I'll be good for any field...\n\nI have MAJOR anxiety and broke up recently(1 month into my internship).It was a 2.5 year relationship which ended up in him cheating on me and it just added to the problem. I am severly depressed and I feel like this internship is consuming my life. I am not able to cope and put in proper work to even make it till october.I feel this weight on my chest 24/7 and I drown myself in negativity everyday no matter how hard I try to stay optimistic. I am always low on energy and positivity. I have tried to workout in the morning and tried meditating but it only seems to work momentarily. I don't know if I'll be able to get counselling. I think even this huge paragraph can't fully explain the wreck I am right now...My mom does understand my anxiety but she also thinks I am afraid and don't have the ability to cope with it. Which is true but I feel helpless. I am not even able to plan my escape. I clearly suck at taking decisions(took CS even when I should have gone into fine arts or animation, and now took a job that is clearly not for me). I know I am directly responsible for my own choices but I don't know what to do...I dont know how I'm going to transition into ui/ux effectively, I am not able to decide for the course I should be taking and how to go about it...I feel like I am stuck between the past and the future and unable to work for my present...I am the only new intern in this team among my peers, and having a hard time since I am a slow learner and I panic when all the other senior members try to test my knowledge...it is annoying my manager. I am not smart enough for this job. I am not able to communicate to my peers about my mental health and lagging in progress. \n \nMy anxiety has worsened with time....I think it also has to do with the fact that I'm not doing what I'm passionate about since highschool (and its common in india) and it has just killed me from inside. I find myself making excuses to my team regularly and I wish sickness upon myself just so I can get a break from it and its only been a week in the team after the initial training..Everyday I decide to do better, I feel mentally exhausted in the end. I try to be hopeful and enduring but fail...sleep is the only peace I know but that also often includes nightmares.. I dont feel like making art or even watch a show that might make me feel better..\n\nI would really appreciate someone sharing any similar experience or just your thoughts on the situation...please, I feel alone and hopeless...

Every opportunity I have had has been a step up. Challenging and rewarding. \n\nA former employer of mine has approached me to come back. They have a completely different work model now. New leadership (over the last year and a half) and I know most of the workforce in the Professional Services department I would be in. All a good group of guys. This would be for a software engineer role where I\u2019d be coming in and enhancing a C# solution they have for implementations. Applying existing knowledge to the existing projects and expanding said knowledge to do more. Given its within professional services, it will also be project based and cyclical. \n\nWhere I am currently employed, I started 8 months ago, basically doing what I did as a vendor for the company. The issue is that I was sold something completely different than I am doing and do not foresee a change for another year or two or beyond unless I seek it. The role took a transition another a employee left and I was the best fit to fill the void. \n\nThe dilemma is two fold. Both are great opportunities. Solid pay, benefits. One offered a better balance, and I just started my LLC which could turn into something down the road. My point here is to have time to invest into both. \n\nThe new role would really press on the job training while I pursue my masters. Which I\u2019ll be doing either way. \n\nI\u2019ve done the whole compare and contrast with pros and cons. They both seem to balance each out. \n\nThe only major difference if that I\u2019m strictly focused in a niche of the industry in on if I stay with my existing role. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m seeking to be an expert in and it\u2019s also a pretty custom application. We know in Tech, staying on top of tech stacks on your niche is huge. Maybe that\u2019s debatable on the company, but you catch my drift. \n\nIt isn\u2019t a major boost in salary. But is a completely different change of pace. I did take it to management and see what can be done if I they wanted to keep me. But that is all here say. I\u2019ve been told things before and no change occurs. \n\nPardon the rant.

Unfortunately, both of these positions are unpaid. I have a pretty good amount of experience with CS, and the roles I'd take on at both of these startups would be pretty technical, and I think I'd learn a good amount - I'd be directly working with the founders on ML/IOT type stuff which is pretty interesting. They also told me they'd teach me a good amount of entrepreneurial/business heavy stuff which could potentially be helpful for me since I do plan on getting into the startup space myself.\n\nI've read countless posts and comments on this thread advising people to stray away from unpaid internships and I largely agree with the sentiment - I feel it's unwise to dedicate my time(and brain) towards a position where I'm not monetarily compensated, when I could potentially use those same skills to make money. However, I don't really have any paid positions in hand I could do over these, and my only real option to make money in the traditional \"job\" sense would be to get a minimum wage type job. I am planning on doing some form of academic tutoring and potentially tech consulting for local businesses during the summer alongside whatever else I do, so I do plan on making at least some money regardless.\n\nIf I don't do an internship, I'd likely take an additional class over the summer and work on further solidifying my algo skills(LeetCode or something of the like), and maybe dabble with a few personal projects.\n\nWhat makes the most sense from a future recruitment perspective? I plan on applying to programs like Google STEP/Facebook Uni etc, and just generally field for high tier internships next summer, so would doing an unpaid internship help with that? I got rejected from Google CSSI this summer, so I really want to optimize my chances of getting something good next.\n\nAre there any last ditch resorts I could do for making money this summer through tech(besides the volatile consulting stuff)? Bonus points if they're also optically good from a recruitment perspective.\n\nFinally, is there anything else you guys would recommend I do this summer or even early in college given the information I've provided thus far?\n\nThank you!

        "body": " Long story short, I quit my job in 2019. I was making great money but it was a very stressful situation and my health was deteriorating from the stress. So, I decided to take some time off. I had been working for 15 years until that point and have done a good job saving aggressively and investing. The plan was to take a couple months off and then start looking for another job - the vision was it to be a total of 6 months of sabbatical. It so happened to be that the pandemic hit and my unemployment ended up going a lot longer. However, even though not working for an employer, I am actually doing a quite a lot of things day to day. I have picked up some freelance consulting, I own an investment residential property which I rent out for 2x return (rent compared to mortgage) that I have now taken the responsibility to do the property management (instead of hiring someone), I have picked up on trading options and I have done well with my stock choices (I guess everyone has since the market was in such a crazy bull run) but I have exited many stocks with 3 or 4x returns. I have also lost on a few but the net gain has been solid. I also have an additional source of income through dividend stocks. All together, while it might seem to an outside viewer that I am doing nothing, I am actually doing a lot.\n\nI have enjoyed my day to day life quite a bit doing all of these various things and I actually have made more than enough money to cover my expenses and have money left over for savings and discretionary income. Is there anyway that I could consolidate all of these activities under some sort of an investment company? Or a holding company? Or perhaps an LLC? If my rental property continues to do well, I would ideally love to add another one. My options trading has also been a secure sense of basic income because I use very low risk strategies which allows me to make modest gains off of my options trading. It all adds up of course, and along with the free lance consulting, I believe I am making enough money for the time being. But, it would be nice to make all my activities into something consolidated and more professional. This way, if and when I do return to applying for jobs, it would also look better on my resume to consolidate all this work into some sort of professional entity instead of just describing all the various activities I was doing when unemployed.\n\nI would appreciate any advice anyone has for me. I am aware that many of these investment activities can go up and can go down and that is why I want to retain the prospect of again applying to jobs at some point.",

So how comparable is that to a normal dev role? Like would this be considered easier than a Front End dev role, or just totally different? I understand elementor is like a no code site, that you can customize as needed. But I wanted to make sure this isn't something completely unrelated to Front End dev work for example. I'm fine starting here, but I don't want to screw the company over if they hired me and it's just totally unrelated to what a Dev normally does.

I agreed to help, making it clear that I would only work for it as a side project.\n\nI think it's important to add that this was paid (not that the money was too important to me) and the individual had been \"conned\" before finding someone for this project and I didn't them to feel the same had happened again.\n\nI was told this was a simple program and handed a link to a Github repo with some ML code (although for a different purpose) and told to use this verbatim to build a program for stock markets. As expected, it didn't work out of the box.\n\nI'm repeatedly told by the client that they \"understand\" machine learning and python however I question this. I've been told my approaches (such as using accuracy/f1 scores as metrics isn't important and that modern ML engineers are too \"obsessed\" with analysing results of training/testing data).\n\nI've been working on this project since April but the classifier hasn't been able to learn the training data, but I've been told to not deviate from the code on Github. In my own time, I've experimented with changing this code and achieved better results. The client also wants the program to be simple to run and always produce good results without changing the fine details of the model - I don't think this is possible.\n\nThe client has not been able to run the program on their pc - it cannot find the data files. I have tested it myself and can find no issues on my end, but I suspect the issue is due to the environment from which their python is running from.  I have tried to provide support to help the problem - but was told I shouldn't spend my time on that.\n\nI received a lengthy email yesterday from the client, berating my approach to the development of the program and informed me that in the real world I would have fired for focusing too much on making it possible for them to run the program and for developing code in my preferred IDE rather than the one they specified. Although, I was told that as our working relationship was more casual, it wasn't as much of an issue.\n\nI felt hurt by this email as I've tried my best to work hard on this project, being professional and honest about the limits of my coding abilities. It's made me question my skills and decisions in coding and machine learning.\n\nQuestions::\n\nI'm not looking to continue this working relationship further, but the professional in me wants to provide at least the basic program he requested - given they have had difficulty running the program, is it professional enough to screenshot it working on my system (on their preferred IDE) and not bother helping them to get it working on theirs?\n\nSo far I've been paid for about 9hrs of work. I don't want to be badmouthed as a \"scammer\" like the previous individuals working for them. Should I hand back the money, if the program isn't fully complete?\n\nShould I have developed my code in the IDE of their choice? Should I have at least mentioned I was going to use another? Personally, I didn't see the issue just using another one.\n\nHow should I learn from this going forward? Did I make the right calls?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if this comes off as more of a rant but thanks in advance for any advice/feedback/suggestions. I feel upset and guilty about the situation and really, I don't want to be thought badly of!\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl; dr\n\nFresh grad, side hustle client is difficult to work with and sent an email berating my approach to developing their program.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nE: BTW, I'm in the UK (if that's relevant - ?)

They use Teams for communication and was invited to the team's channel (we are about 11 in the team), but like I was just peeking at what they were saying and it was like extremely formal, I get that at the beginning me and my coworkers don't know each others we have like this wall of professionalism that is maintained and over the course of working together we might bring this down. This team have been working together for 3 years and they still talk like they are sending an email to their superiors to each others! They've been working together for 3 years! Immediately I felt really put off by this weird vibe as I'm a person that likes working, but you know it's fun to actually enjoy working with your team and have friendly banter, share memes, etc... There's was none of it between them, even in group calls no one was talking to each other, nothing.\n\nNow, this feeling they don't like me started from the fact that my superior was explaining to me my project, since I already know most of the technologies, this was fairly straight forward to understand and was basically just noding along, because I was understanding what he wanted me to do. Then he asked me: \"Any questions?\", then I replied that I had none and was ready to go work, then he replied with a weird tone \"Know all the answers, huh?\", I was really confused by that, but replied \"No, it's just that everything was explained clearly I'll let you know if I have any questions for you\" and then we finished the call soon after.\n\nHe was telling me that project should take me about 1 or 2 months, but after 1 week and a half I was already done with it. I gave him multiple notices that I'll be done soon to give him time to either give him time to clear his agenda to review what I did, or to find me something else to do. The last day I pushed everything, he called me telling me my next project. I asked him, what about the last project, I think maybe there could be room to improve and would like comments on certain modules and he just waved off my request to code review by saying \"You know a lot of things, surely there won't be any issues right?\" and I was like \"Sure, but I'd still like some comments, I always have room to improve\" and he just said \"We'll see in a few months\", which in my books with a limited internship time that means fuck off, next project.\n\nI hate this so much, the thing is I think I'm doing the right things and I would've liked to work there after the internship, because it's a huge company that goes well on my resume, but don't know what to do.\n\nTL;DR: Weird formal team vibe, speeding through the project I received, my superior seems to think I'm a pretentious know-it-all, denies me any type of code review, because \"I know a lot\" and just drops me another project on the table to do.",

We didn't have any course on algos. So my programming skills were also lacking\n\nPost-graduation I landed a job in an embedded software company that develops software for ARM-based embedded hardware.

This book about Rust I'm reading describes systems programming like this:\n\n>Systems programming is for:\n\n* Operating systems\n* **Device drivers of all kinds**\n* Filesystems\n* **Databases**\n* Code that runs in very cheap devices, or **devices that must be extremely reliable**\n* Cryptography\n* Media codecs (software for reading and writing audio, video, and image files)\n* **Media processing** (for example, speech recognition or photo editing software)\n* **Memory management** (for example, implementing a garbage collector)\n* Text rendering (the conversion of text and fonts into pixels)\n* Implementing higher-level programming languages (like JavaScript and Python)\n* **Networking**\n* **Virtualization** and software containers\n* **Scientific simulations**\n* **Games** \n\n**Why I'm interested:**  Not sure about the accuracy of this description, but this all sounds much more interesting to me than the backend webdev path I'd been paying attention to for the last 1-2 years. I have no real world backend experience but from what I've read and heard, most backend jobs are pretty repetitive and \"easy\" in the sense that the difficulty is more about understanding the tools than actually writing the code/business logic.  I used to think a predictable, relatively easy job that pays well was everything I wanted. IDK if it's my ADHD or what, but I've realized I find that type of work incredibly painful, especially if it's for 8 hours a day 5 days a week. I think I'd rather pull my hair out trying to optimize code or find a memory leak than be bored to tears looking at the clock or reading the Spring docs. The inescapable \"pick your poison\" reality of jobs really dawned on me. \n\n**My questions:** What are systems programming jobs really like? What should I do to become a job-ready systems dev?",

We heard that the school was great and he was super excited at first but then disappointed in the courses and the level of education but didn't care much cause he needed the diploma in order to seek better jobs opportunities here and gain experience and leave the country.\n\n\n\n Until, one day, they called him and asked to come sign a paper where once he finishes school, he won't demand his \"engineer\" title cause he doesn't have a bachelor degree. WE THOUGHT at first that they were going to make an exception And now they wouldn't explain  what type of diploma he would get, while he's taking engineering classes. it just didn't make sense at all. \n\n\n\nHe's depressed now. \nWe thought about looking for online degrees but they were so unaffordable.\nI told him if he wanted to find jobs abroad he should just apply cause first, he's great at what he's doing and is experienced, second, the diploma doesn't matter that much cause some companies test you for your abilities and the paper doesn't matter that much. (or does it?). But he always tells me that the diploma does matter as well and no company will even offer him a job interview for a diploma of 2 years and that isn't even a bachelor. \n\n\nHe's lost now, and is very depressed cause our system is pretty messed up, and companies here require engineering diplomas, master's ect..\nOr else he'd be working for 300$ a month (if he's lucky enough) \n\n\nSo any idea on what should he do? \n\n\nHe started doubting himself and his abilities, feels like nothing is going right and is slowly giving up. \nIf you have any idea on affordable accredited online degrees, or any advice would really help me. so i can help him with this.",

        "body": "I understand the following might come off as me bragging in the form of a complaint, or might sound like a nonproblem, but I assure you it has been eating away at me.\n\nI recently reached out to my senior developer to ask for a performance review and talk about my career goals. I've been with the company for a little over a year, and during the conversation I also wanted to ask for a raise. The figure I had in mind was around 10k or so, and I thought I would have to fight for that. \n\nThe beginning of the conversation went really well. He gave me both positive and constructive feedback, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. As I was about to move on to the next part and ask him about a raise, I asked him if there was anything else he'd like to add. That's when told me he'd like to work on promoting me, and asked me if I wanted a promotion sooner than later. I was caught off guard slightly, and I told him I don't necessarily wanted to be promoted quickly, but would like a salary bump. But he proceeded to push the idea of a promotion and told me he likes my passion and how much I've been growing. He told me he'd get it going within the next few weeks. \n\nOkay so here's the thing. I don't think I quite deserve it. I think there's still a lot of work I struggle with that I need to improve on, and I have sometime to go before deserving it. The promotion will come with probably a 30-40k salary increase, and that seems like a really big deal. It shouldn't be too different in terms of responsibility, so the issue isn't that I won't be able to fulfill my responsibilities. The problem is more a  mental guilt that this is undeserved and I didn't really work for it. I think my senior dev was just scared of losing me combined with the fact that we have a good relationship and he's a nice guy, so he decided to promote me if I wanted. \n\nAm I overthinking the hell out of this? Should I just be grateful and go along with it? Or should I go back and push the idea of a smaller salary bump while waiting on the promotion?",

        "body": "I have been seeing a lot of hate for gaming companies on this subreddit coming from people who never actually worked in the industry or haven't worked in the industry since early 2000s, and I just want to share my own personal experience of working in this industry and shed some light on it so that other people who might want to do this type of work are not discouraged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have worked in 2 other companies, which would be considered quite big (not FAANG) and I quite enjoyed my time there but that was mostly due to relaxed work environment, and after 4 months I would get quite bored and hate my job since I would be working on a product that I could not care less about. Then I decided to try and work in the Gaming Industry, it seemed like it would be a fun thing to do, so I joined a mid sized Canadian gaming company (\\~300 employees), and now I have worked here for almost a year and will continue working here for as long as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince I was new to the industry, I really was not sure if I should pursue this as my career because of all the negative opinions that I heard about it. So I talked to a bunch of senior engineers who have been in the industry for over 20 years, and the main take away that I got is that this industry changed drastically in the last 10 years and that it has become one of the best work/life balance places to work at if you can pick the right company. Strange right? All I have been told form this subreddit is that it is the worst thing to come out of Software Engineering and you should only work there if work is your life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComparing my current job to the previous ones here is the pros and cons list:\n\nPros:\n\n1. More vacation time, you get about 7 weeks of paid time off and 10 paid sick days. I have never heard of a company in my region giving more than 4 weeks of vacation time.\n2. Better work life balance. Overtime is not allowed unless you get a written permission from your manager. According to other engineers, in the last 4 years there has been only one occurrence of required overtime. It was only for 1 week and it was paid.\n3. Transparency. I am not sure if this is due to the company being relatively small, but the transparency is insane. We are told about all the future projects (even before they are signed), the company shares how much money they made from each game and how much money they still have. Feedback from our games (before release) is shared company wide and not stored in secret for the managers to figure out.\n4. Sense of community and amazing culture. You know that corporate talk and how everyone is super serious all the time and how some companies never seem to have fun? Well this company just feel like a bunch of friends making games.\n5. Constant feedback and freedom to work on what you enjoy. The company actually seems to care about their employees, and tries to constantly improve and be the best company to work for. For example I wanted to work on another project aspect, so my manager started giving me more work items relating to that aspect, easy right?\n6. Zero micromanaging. You work on your own time, and as long as you complete your tasks, nobody ever asks you what you did all day.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Salary. Okay, this is the only one that is true, the salaries are lower, but it is not that bad! In Canada new grad salaries are about 70-85k (unless its FAANG), and gaming industry currently offers 65k. However, after looking into it a bit more, what I gathered is that in 3 years after starting at the company it is pretty normal to have your salary increased to 90k. Which is more than enough to live comfortably, and that's just after 3 years!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, for me I would say it is definitely worth staying in the industry, the paycut is not that big of a deal since even 65k is way more than majority of people get paid in Canada, and I am finally having fun at my job week in and week out. I do work on the engine and network side of things, and do not actually directly work on gameplay. However, if you do want to work on the gameplay side, do know that it is not like working on games on your time since you do not have much creative freedom. For me personally it just seems way more fun to work on a video game and tell people that I worked on this sick game, rather than telling people I worked on an SSD for some corporate company, or some network device that nobody cares about or another SAAS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously this does not apply to every gaming company, but I would say majority of gaming companies in Canada reflect the pros I talked about rather than the cons people talk about on this subreddit (I talked about this a lot with senior engineers)",

        "body": "For some context, I recently got my first ever SWE job out of college. I didn't do any internships so this is my first real world experience. I am only a few months in and I am already questioning if I should change industries. \n\nMy company is a small custom dev shop in the midwest. We use a stack that I had no experience in starting, and they gave me a week to go through some Udemy courses to get up to speed. \n\nAfter that, they threw me on a project as a lone developer with a PM and QA. The project is over 2 years old and a fixed bid so my company just wanted someone to try and get the client to sign off on the contract. \n\nAfter about a month of working on that, the client is very close to signing off. I have learned a lot about the framework we use and how to go through QA and deploy to Heroku. \n\nThen my company started throwing other projects my way, while that original project was still wrapping up. Just some small fixes to other projects. But once again, I was always a lone developer. We have a code review process, but it is basically just send a PR to another dev on slack and they will leave messages if there are major issues. \n\nThen about 2 weeks ago I got asked to give a bid to a client that wanted a major change to an existing app. It was an app with several thousand users that was built by a different dev shop in town. Except the other dev shop put almost all the data in the same table, causing major issues related to data redundancy and very limited features using such schemea. On top of that, this project was in yet another framework and language I did not have experience in. I basically told my PM that I didn't not feel comfortable giving a bid in a framework I had never worked with. So they set up a meeting with another senior dev who walked through some of it with my. Basically saying we are going to guess a very high number that the client likely won't like. So now I am waiting to hear back if I am going to have to do that project. \n\nCut to today. I am still working on the original project with a nightmare client who will still not sign off on the contract yet. And more small projects keep coming in. Some days I get PMs sending me slack messages to get 3-4 projects done or worked on. And other than reaching out to other developers via slack I am totally alone on fixing these issues. \n\nI was wondering if this is normal? Should I just bite my teeth and grind few the first few months as I am still learning everything? Or should I start finding a new job? \n\nMy issue is it was difficult for me to find a job to begin with, and now quitting after only a few months is not going to help me get another job. But these last couple months have made me hate programming more than I thought I ever would. I feel as though I am not getting any better at programming as I am always fixing small things and asked to do so quickly. Making me rush to get a working solution even if I know it is not the best programming.",

I ended up writing a number of complicated VBA macros, and doing a lot of self learning on the side. When I was laid off about 8 months ago, I started learning C# on my own full time. I did the beginner, intermediate and halfway through the expert level C# courses by Mosh. I struggled a bit with more of the complicated topics, so I decided upon a grand learning project to solidify all the concepts I had already learned.\n\nIn comes OpenTitration, a fully standalone and automated software package for analyzing titration data ( [OpenTitration Tutorial - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRVPSNFoh8k&t=40s) ). I wrote all the C# code on my own, and invited a collaborator to do some work in python, although all the data science analysis was done by me. I am 30 years old, already have two university degrees (in chemistry) and would like to avoid getting a computer science degree if possible.

I graduated this past weekend and have been job hunting for entry-level/new graduate/junior SWE roles since the beginning of the year with little progress. I got some call-backs and even got to the technical portions of the interviews but never made it past that. Recently, I got invited to go into the final round of interviews with a health care company for a newly graduated Systems Analyst position. I have read on this sub that the position is just a title and the work depends on what company it's for, but this position is basically to automate some redundant internal tasks like setting up servers and whatnot. When I asked about the possibility of career growth in terms of coding, I was informed I would only be coding some scripts for maybe 30% of the time, while the other 70% of the time would be focusing on \"other things,\" whatever that means?

That\u2019s great and all, but the problem is I\u2019m not sure if I should pass up on this offer; that is if I get past this final round. Maybe it\u2019s imposter syndrome, but I feel as though my coding skills aren\u2019t where they should be as a new grad, especially because I wasn\u2019t able to land any internships while I was still in school, which I regret. I have some interesting class projects keeping my resume afloat and plan to keep tweaking them just to teach myself new things, but I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019ll be enough as well. I also still plan to grind Leetcode problems, take Coursera courses for certifications and apply to other SWE positions until I hear the final decision for this Systems Analyst position, but I am feeling anxious.

Here are our thoughts, and I'd love to hear what you guys think/have experienced.\n\nRight now we are doing kanban style boards. There is a big list of backlog items. We don't really spend a lot of time on estimates - that ticket looks like it'll probably take 4 hours, so we put 4 hours. There are no sprints. You finish a ticket, you move on to the next. So it's structured-ish in the sense that we do have things to do... but it seems never-ending, and like we're always in crunch mode. Whereas we have both been in a company or on a project where they did agile/sprints - we have to get x features done in the next 2 weeks. This feels more manageable because a ticket might have been estimated to take 4 hours, but it took us 6 - that's ok, the estimate wasn't super accurate. Or a ticket might have been estimated to take 6 hours, but it took us 4 - now we're ahead and we don't have to work as hard on the next ticket because we have an extra 1-2 hours on it. It also gives us an \"end\" (the end of the sprint), if that makes any sense. Our current kanban style just feels like it'll never end, and it feels like we're going to burnout a bit. I recognize that realistically the work doesn't actually end after 2 weeks in sprints/agile - but it still \\*feels\\* better to have that structured end.\n\nHow does your guys' companies do it?

The recruiter replied saying she will talk to the managing director to get final approval and will send over the official offer letter. 3 days later she emails me back saying they could not approve my asking price and are offering me 7k less than the original base salary that recruiter sent over. I am very disappointed and not sure what to do in this situation. I do want the job and would take the original base salary, but this whole situation leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Any advice?

She submitted the higher number which I asked for to the managing director, but that number is at absolute high end for the position, and based on my experience, geo location, market data etc they got a different, lower number, which is in the mid range for this position.

My eventual goal is to land a database developer position related to primarily data warehousing and I have been studying independently since COVID hit. I have attended university as a comp sci major for two years but never finished due to reasons both within and out of my control, so I understand that reaching such a position would require demonstration of competency suitable for such a role along with the certifications to prove it (working on Oracle 071, AWS Solutions Architect Associate, and possibly Snowflake Snowpro Core). \n\nOnto the substance of my question, I'm presented with a dilemma where I can:\n\n* choose to work part time (prob only 20-25 hrs a week) that pays well in a completely unrelated field that allows me time to essentially be a fulltime student with the materials I have been using to study thus far\n* or work as an IT intern getting paid $12/hr doing 40hr weeks, allowing me significantly less time to study on my own terms\n\nMy concern with the latter option is that while it is much more closely related to my eventual position, the internship is for a purely IT focused company where I wouldn't necessarily be able to learn anything related to my end goal. Personally, I feel confident enough in my ability to study independently to continue working towards my certs so I'm leaning towards the former option but I'd imagine that many other developers in the field that I eventually want to reach have started from IT positions so I want to get a second opinion on the matter since I feel that I may have some bias preventing me from making an objective decision.

However, I did not have a ssn card (believe it was thrown away by a cleaner, at a previous home at the beginning of covid), but I figured a passport would suffice. I ordered my social security replacement card in March, however, there was a mistake and I had to resubmit it. The SSN office told me the earliest it would ship to me is July. \n\nMy boss said I would have 90 days from the start date to supply the card if i have the receipt, but only if I have the receipt, which the receipt takes upwards of 2-3 months just like the replacement card itself. So i'm hoping that my card will come before then. I have a temporary ssn card, and i'm still waiting back to see if that will suffice. But I'm worried, wouldn't I not get paid until I can supply my ssn card since it's for the I9? \n\nI'm nervous that the job offer will be revoked because in the offer letter it says if I don't have all my required qualifications, I.E graduation, pre employement onboarding passport + ssn card within a few days of my start date the offer could be withdrew. But when speaking with my boss that sounds like that's not the case. \n\nI'm awaiting a final email response tomorrow, essentially how big of a problem this is.

        "body": "I've been working at a .NET shop for most of my career, which is admittedly not very long compared to most of you, and I'm a little older and got off to a later start than I should have. It hasn't really been the best job in terms of pay or excitement. The tech stack is all .NET, but using older technologies like WinForms and WCF services. Despite that, I really enjoyed working with the people on my team and that was enough to keep me around. My company was bought out recently, and while I was given a promotion and a pay raise, most of those people I really enjoyed working with are gone now for one reason or another. I realized I can't remember the last time I genuinely enjoyed my work here, so I feel like it's probably time for me to move on as well, but I'm not having a lot of luck.\n\nI'm not very familiar with web-based stuff beyond some light personal tinkering with Angular and react, although nothing that would make me confident enough to mention it in a job interview. I've more recently become fairly adept (probably only in my own opinion) at replacing our old services at work with REST APIs in .NET 5, but that's probably the closest thing to a modern skill that I have.\n\nI'm finally in a place where I can afford to take a paycut to try and start over, but just about every .NET job listing makes me feel like a failure with their requirements for 5+ years of Javascript and React and/or Angular. I'd love to get into it because what little of it I've seen is very interesting, but between my current job and family life, I don't have a lot of energy to spare with trying to teach myself on the side. I feel like my only hope is to get a new job where I can really jump into it full time and to be around others more knowledgeable than myself so I can ask a lot of questions. \n\nAre there any back-end oriented jobs out there where I can get my foot in the door working on APIs, or am I stuck where I'm at and trying to learn what I can with only a few minutes a day to spare? I keep joking that I'm just going to apply to Taco Bell instead, but it sounds like less and less of a joke every time I say it.",

        "body": "I originally made a post 27 days ago on April 19th 2021 asking when to throw in the towel with job searching. It was one of the lowest days in my life. I had let pity creep in and I felt I was putting in too much work with no reward. I was a day away from giving up.\n\nHere is the original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/muh32a/when\\_to\\_throw\\_in\\_the\\_towel/gv5xidr/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/muh32a/when_to_throw_in_the_towel/gv5xidr/)\n\nA few Redditors stepped in and gave me some much-needed words of encouragement and convinced me it was just the nature of the game and to just keep at it. [u/abv281](https://www.reddit.com/u/abv281/) I'll never forget you.\n\nI am proud to say I landed my dream job just a few days after making the original post. It was about a month-long process, and I formally accepted the offer today.\n\nBut that's not my intent of this post. This post is here to act as a reminder to the ones currently trying to land their first job. I know exactly how you are feeling, and it's normal, we've all been there.\n\nI want you to think of your job search like this:\n\nImagine you had a little tea light candle and it's in a pile of branches. Eventually one will catch, you just need to worry about keeping your tea light lit. Just don't give up. Everything worth anything in life is hard to get. It will be one of the most rewarding feelings you experience, I promise.\n\nBe open to receiving advice from strangers on the internet, but also realize some of that advice is just that, from strangers who don't know your exact situation. I have had loads of good advice, but also loads of bad advice. I don't think it's anyone's intent to give bad advice, but you will come to find out, people are very opinionated. You'll eventually be able to gauge what's good and what's not good for your situation.\n\nI think we all know how people feel about the interview process. It's pretty polarizing, but learn to play the game. Once you learn how to play the game, it gets significantly easier. Just hammer hacker-rank and leetcode problems until you know them inside and out, eventually that gets fun because you naturally get better the more you do. Read cracking the coding interview, I CAN'T STRESS this enough. These things will help build your confidence for when you get your chance to shine.\n\nLastly and most importantly, stop doing funky sh\\*t with your resumes. I know YOU think they look good and innovative. But, I will be first in line to tell you it's a bad idea. I am a front-end dev, so I figured I would make my resume all clean and minimal. I don't think I received one callback from any of those resumes. The content didn't change much, just the way I presented it. Stick to the basics, there are tons of posts on Saturdays about resumes in this community. LISTEN TO WHAT THEY TELL YOU! As soon as I spent the time to revise my resume to the industry standard, I was getting callbacks, not tons, but finally was getting the call-back.\n\nHave fun with this process, I know it gets extremely frustrating at times, but it's 100% possible with the right amount of work and a little bit of luck. Don't let life pass you by, things will work out, you'll figure it out, or else you wouldn't be where you're at today. My inbox is always open to younger candidates looking for advice.\n\nThank you for everything r/cscareerquestions!",

        "body": "This is my manager's first time being a manager. We are an engineering team of 9 people, 2 are founders. My manager isn't a founder. Here are some of the things I've had to deal with:\n\n\\- When I was first hired my manager said I could change our version control from SVN to git. This process took over 6 months to do, not because it was a hard technical change, that was the easy part, but because one founder was so not cool with needing to learn git for the first time and we had to painstakingly get his buy in every step of the way.\n\n\\- I was told I could add React to our frontend when I was first hired. It's been over 2 years and I've had every proposal dismissed as totally dead in the water because the same founder has never used React and doesn't want to learn it.\n\n\\- The same founder lost 8 months of work because he claims he accidentally wiped his hard drive twice. He did this twice.\n\n\\- One week before we needed to ship a project I was leading for 2 months, the founder didn't respond in slack for over 48 hours. He requires that he review all of my code before we ship. I had to escalate on the last day before we shipped to the CTO to say we were at risk. The founder magically appeared in seconds ready to review my code and I somehow still shipped on time.\n\n\\- Normally, I would think a coworker being MIA for 2 days was because of a crisis, but he regularly just doesn't show up to work. He never explained why he dipped. No one in leadership said they would talk to him or even said \"that wasn't ok\". We all just know that he does this.\n\n\\- My opinion is never genuinely factored into any code change. It's always whatever this founder wants ultimately. I've explained this to my manager as being undesirable and he said \"you need to reach alignment\" which we both knew meant \"just agree with him\"\n\n\\- My manager followed all of his subordinates on Instagram, which I saw as wildly unprofessional (it's not like I can really not accept a follow request from my manager) and then randomly unfollowed me in December.\n\n\\- My manager hired a known transphobic guy to our team knowing a trans woman I worked with didn't want to work with this person. That trans woman quit shortly after.\n\n\\- My manager allegedly (according to the trans woman I worked with) went to a concert with her, a coworker, by themselves and bought her flowers. He is married with two kids.\n\n\\- The founder and that transphobic guy had a yelling match in a meeting for 2.5 hours in a 1 hour scheduled meeting. The transphobic guy was fired. The founder wasn't. I was never pulled aside by leadership and told that this kind of meeting behavior is not ok.\n\nI've seen over 20 people quit within two years at a \\~50 person company. Everyone hates working with this founder, it's not personal and it's not just me. I am exhausted though. I really, really like working with basically all other coworkers expect for these two. I like the company mission. I just hate feeling completely unsupported by my manager and working with a founder that's like this. Any ideas on how best to cope with this or ways I can somehow make this situation less awful?",

I understand that he is onboarding to this team, but he has been around the company for multiple years as well. He is very difficult to ask questions or ask for any sort of support and resources. I have asked multiple times for basic context and help in some areas, but for the most part I've had to figure out everything on my own which has been super frustrating. \n\nI mentioned this to the staffing agency that I work through, and they sent an email to the director who sent an email to my manager and then my manager pulled me into a meeting and bitched me out for going above him about the issues I'm having. \n\nNot really sure where to turn for help or how to approach the situation.

We are working on a really huge web application which is used by clients all over the world (US, Europe mostly). It has 60-70 repositories in our bitbucket just for this app.\n\nThe first few weeks was hard to get use to the code base and building methods, dependencies etc. I had to ask a lot and my code reviews always had a lot of issues. But now I can work on my own with only asking a few times a day. I am doing tickets on my own and I can finally understand the whole pipeline.\n\nMy boss gave me a feedback last week that I improved and learnt a lot and he is satisfied with me and after the 3 months trial period my salary would be increased a bit.\n\nDoes this mean I am doing it well and don't have to fear of getting fired after the trial period? I'm asking this because I don't have much confidence and self-esteem..\n\nWhat is the average learning curve for junior devs? Although I've already worked during school as an intern but it was backend and C# only so I'm not truly a junior dev but junior in frontend stuff.\n\nEdit: my daily tasks are usually: implementing new features, fixing bugs and writing unit/app tests.",

All my friends are either already in US working at good companies or are going for MS by 2021/2022 fall, therefore around 80% of my fiends will leave india by 2022, and rest have switched companies 1-2 times and are at a very good package right now. \n\nHere i am just thinking what i want to do, to be honest since the beginning of 2021 i have this entrepreneurial spirit inside me. In jan end I became an amazon seller and slowly slowly by march actually I started earning decent amount through it though my items are limited and seasonal but then because of lockdown orders have stopped, along with that i have gained a lot of interest in stock market and have been studying a lot about it as well, during office hours i am more interested in looking at charts rather than office work. I also love to cook so have a dream of my own restaurant as well one day.\n\nSo the issue is , i am able to do this only because SAP is chill work wise and because of the work from home policy, the moment that gets over my side activities will take a pause and even if we ignore that, though i am very interested in both the side things which i started and wish to increase their level, but its very much possible that they either remain a passive source of income or after some time i get frustrated and decide to end both of them because everything is exciting in beginning, and if this happens 1-1.5 year down the lines, i would be a 25-26 year old developer still at that average job , not achieved much whereas all the people i know would be way ahead of me and probably would be too late for me then and i may regret not going for MS when i had the time.\n\nI had a 9.5+ cgpa in my cse btech so all of my friends really push hard and encourage me to pursue MS, but to be really honest i am not that interested in studying, i have the fascination of living outside india but sudying i am not so sure and more over i suck at algo ds, i even started studying algo ds around feb so that i can try to switch but i truly have 0 interest in that so i kind of only did it for less than a month. So my fear is even if i complete my degree and then i am not able to crack an interview there , then it will be even more messed up because i will have loan on my head.\n\nThere is a possibility that after going into the college i start liking the things that are taught there and really get into it but will lose on the current opportunity, because with SAP i can truly experiment on lot of other things in life, so i kind of have a stable source of income and can work on side things as well which a person cant do at a later stage of life when he has more responsibilities on his head.\n\nI am not sure which path to continue and any suggestions will help a lot.\n\nAnd thanks a lot for taking out time to read such a long Post.",

It reduced the operational cost by 40%, removed dependency on external software which was charging money. Along with that, I was able to interface a UI over the web (like being able to interact with a VM using a GUI). There were a lot of other components in the project which involved pricing strategies, application monitoring and he even wanted a conversational AI for the users.\n\nI took a judgment call in developing the infrastructure of the product before adding the other features. The professor wanted me to continue working on the product even in my final semester. But due to health issues and the need to find full-time employment weighed heavily on my mind, so I declined.\n\nI used to frequent this subreddit and saw people post getting jobs after applying to 700+ companies. On the other hand, I did not even apply to 200 companies. I applied using referrals and still was not considered for an interview. This all affected my mental health which caused me to stop applying altogether.\n\nOne of the hiring managers from the big tech saw my profile on LinkedIn, was interested in me, and set up an interview with me. Long story short after 5 rounds of interviews. \n\nThe great thing is that I will be working with a team that is trying to build a similar product but at a much larger scale, and involving physical machines as well. \n\nAlso due to my experience, instead of offering me a new grad offer, they bumped me to a higher level.\n\nI having trouble thinking about whether I am good enough, could I have done better, Was I just lucky in landing this job.\n\nWhat are some tips the senior developers would give someone starting out new?\n\nAlso, do I need to work with the professor again to complete the unfinished components?  i don't think he would be vindictive, but is there a possibility of me losing this job because I did not finish everything that was asked of me ?\n\nTLDR: I found a great job in one of the big tech companies on the basis of an interesting project I did as a Research Assistant.

It felt like a huge waste of time spending so much time on LeetCode.\n\nThis time around, I just don\u2019t know what to focus on. There are so many different aspects of interviews to work on and improve and I don\u2019t know which ones are the \u201cmost\u201d important for me to excel at. Is it LeetCode? Is it soft skills? Is it language knowledge? Web knowledge?\n\nI\u2019m seriously struggling with how to break it down into parts and know what to focus on. Can anyone help me figure out what I should focus on? Or how I can figure out what to focus in based off of my own personal assessment?\n\nI totally forgot everything about interviewing, so I\u2019m pretty much a total newbie at this",

        "body": "My boyfriend is 27 with a B.S. in Business Management. He is considering going back to school for computer science, preferably to land a job in IT/cybersecurity (he's not quite sure yet). We both currently work FT to support our family of 3. We are not in a position right now for him to quit his job to attend school FT and his employer will pay for 2 courses a semester currently.\n\nWe live in Florida where we have a major university that offers an all online B.S. in Computer Science program. The problem is that there are lots of pre-reqs he would have to take in order to enter the program, including a foreign language. Which he would have to quit his job in order to take since they are not available online.\n\nSo, he is considering a local community college that offers an A.S. in Computer Science and Web Development. The coursework includes C++, Java, and SQL either on an intro or intermediate level (it is community college after all, so no 3000/4000 level coursework). It is a 60-credit hour program.\n\nHis concern is this: will an A.S. be good enough to land a job? Most jobs we look at require a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. But typically Bachelor's programs consist of 60 hours of general education (english, humanities, science, etc) and 60 hours of program coursework (major specific). If he has a Bachelor's in something else and then gets an A.S. in Computer Science, is that still viewed favorably or almost equal? \n\nThe goal is to get into this field, work with a State employer for a few years to gain the experience and then move into the private sector.

I don't mind any one side of programming but the front end is definitely my vibe. \n\nMy last development job I was hired to be an analyst. The position turned into a full stack job in which I worked for two years. I left that company September 2020 to find something new as the culture was incredibly toxic and I hit my limit (local gov job). I did not have a another job in place. \n\nI ended up accepting a job for a VB/ASP developer after a 3 month search through a very reputable recruiting firm. \n\nThe outfacing culture of the new workplace is much better, but that is about it. I\u2019ve been in the new position for 5 months now and i\u2019m seeing some things that are troubling. \n\n- The job is different then what was expressed in the \ninterview. More specifically what systems of the company I would be working in. Also the entire front end of our client facing site is outsourced which was not communicated with me prior to accepting.\n\n- There is no programming lead/director. The department has two managers and neither have much experience with development.\n\n- Zero onboarding for new developers. - It was a quip document made on the fly by one of the devs \u201ctraining me\u201d. \n\n- The codebase is an absolute nightmare. This company is mid size but they have developed very complex processes to handle all of the unique requirements from vendors. All of this code lives in one 350k+ line solution.\n\n- The codebase has 0 documentation. The dev that is training me (30+ years in the industry) said he had to learn the codebase by single stepping this massive solution. \n\n- The testing environment has data from 2016 because for whatever reason the test database cant be refreshed?\nAll of the devs in the company (about 13) have all worked here for a very long time and tend to be very silod in their work so it\u2019s really hard to tell who is working on what. \n\n- There is 0 accountability for any management or developers here so big decisions on projects and stack changes hardly ever get made and when they are brought up, get shunned by the dev team. The management has to rely on these devs for this kind of advice having little programming knowledge themselves. \n\nI\u2019m very segregated working with the senior dev who is training me (He came on a year before me and struggled with alot of the same issues as me(he has 30+ successful years as a developer).\nMost of that time is spent going back and forth about the issues and problems on the team and with management. I expressed my frustration a few times in that I was thinking about looking around again and he flat out told me \u201cyou need to put some time into a company. iIt\u2019s not good to keep hopping around job to job so frequently. That will really hurt you\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m considering my options but the quote the senior guy gave me gives me some pause. \n\nWe just got assigned a new multi year project to convert a series of old FOX programs the dev team has been dodging for years. Getting any assistance for the beginning of the project has been like pulling teeth. \n\nThere really is no light at the end of the tunnel that I can see. \n\nI want to be in the front end. I was told there would be some opportunities for that here but it seems to be going the opposite direction. \n\nI\u2019m considering using the company Udemy account to sure up some front end frameworks while I look for something else.\n \nMy mental and attitude has sharply decreased with each month. Should I just stick it out for experience sake or try and find a better fit? \n\nThanks for reading. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",

I didn't drop out of University for shits and giggles, I really mean this.\n\n**My Worries:**\n\nI'm not sure if I am making the biggest mistake of my life or the most beneficial, I can only know what I know at 21. I am no wizard, I am not the sharpest tool in the shed. Hell, to be honest with you? I barely know my 3x table. But right now, this seems to be the best decision that is really going to work for me. Perhaps I'll pick up where I left off with my degree, which was, basically nothing anyway. Or I'll leave it altogether. All I know is that being in your early 20's is about taking risks right? At least that's what I tell myself.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nI wanted to know what information you guys could share with me. Any hidden tips that I may likely miss out on that you learned through your self-programming experience. I'm interested to hear your stories and things that have helped you get to where you are today. Thank you.",

        "body": "I was talking to someone and he said that the job of a programmer is  not a lifelong stable career. You do a CS degree and get a job right out of school. Its very well paid, with good work life balance and flexibility and all that. However, you can do the job for ten years only. After that you need to rise up the ranks and become a chief technology officer or something like that or create your own company. Only very few people are ever able to be a CTO or start a successful company. Companies also don't hire anyone over 40 years of age, because they wouldn't usually be up to date with the latest software technology and someone younger knowing the latest tech could be brought in for half the salary. Even designers and company founders, he has seen no one above 40 years of age. \n\nBut for people who want a stable career throughout their working life for 35 years or so, software development is not a good career track at all. \n\nThis is not this person's views only. I talked with two other people in the industry who said something similar. \n\nNow, my question is: Is what he said true? If so, to what extent?",

        "body": "I've been working an hourly job part-time and (at times) full-time towards the end of my studies. It was pretty stressful because the client had dealt with poor hiring choices by my employer.\n\nThe person hired and then fired before I came along wasn't very good, and pushed some of the worst code I had ever seen. Paired with the other dev (my current colleague), they didn't use any testing or version control. App folders were everywhere, and it was just a general mess.\n\nDespite the awful practices I was getting hours to fix their codebase and contribute ideas based on my academic experience, but the client was spending money elsewhere and said he could only afford 1 programmer at a time after 10 months of me working there.\n\nSo a lot of tasks I should've done such as API and mobile app pair was split between me and another dev. The client didn't want to pay me to help the other dev design the API even though the other dev pushed a lot of buggy/badly designed code, which always stretched out the time I worked on the app, which meant I was often waiting for fixes to the API and maybe doing a few Wordpress updates in the meantime. Even recently, I called out a design flaw in the API, and the client's response now was to rewrite it as I would've done it, but have the other dev program it. So obviously going in circles.\n\nLast week, I found a job paying 2x what I was paid last year and put in 4 weeks notice (4 weeks is normal in New Zealand).\n\nMy employer let his largest client know today and in response there was just silence. I don't feel bad at all, because I've been covering rent with savings for the past few months because as an hourly dev, he's pushed my tasks later and later in the year while the other developer worked full time fixing bugs (his coding skills were improving but still green and without tests.. bugs always appeared in production because the client didn't want him to take the time to learn xdebug). My direct employer is cool, but he felt threatened that the client could yank the project at any time, killing his software house.\n\nI imagine the next weeks are going to be hell with the client because he's used to firing people, not having people leave since people often come to him desperate for work. He's abused my employer and my colleague multiple times for their religion because they take breaks to pray. I'm not religious, but I still don't think it's right to shame employees for taking a religious day off or going to prayer in the afternoon.\n\nAnd being that I was the only dev who wrote an entire mobile app and knows Java, his app will be paused until they can find another dev who's willing to work part-time. The worry is that they will get another developer like my predecessor who has no experience and is unwilling to learn. He's likely going to push me to do documentation on everything, which I would've done earlier but he didn't want to pay me to do on his tight deadline.\n\nHow should I approach this if the client gets abusive.. Just leave?",

They did ask me what are my salary expectations and I said \"competitive for a QA Automation engineer with 2 years of experience\". HR replied with a number, which is a bit better than at my current workplace, but I said \"i need a little bit more than that, especially if we're required to return to office, since I have to cover my relocation costs.\"\n\nI did ask for a raise just before the pandemic started, I remember I was extremely angry because of the stress and overworking(at that time, now it's a lot better). They shut me down immediately and nonchalantly declined. I was ready to leave, but they've sent us working from home, and that was alright for me, I could still go like that for a bit, since my expenses have significantly dropped.

I have been teaching myself to code over the last \\~year, starting initially with Python before moving on to C# about 9 months ago.\n\nAlongside some smaller projects and studying (I am about to finish a course which will give me an [HNC in Computing](https://www.whatuni.com/advice/choosing-a-course/what-is-a-hnd-and-a-hnc/2116/)), I have built one larger, more complex project which I have [put onto GitHub](https://github.com/131U3blue/ExifDataReader). \n\nI feel like this project is what I'm mainly hanging my CV on - it's an EXIF (photo metadata) parser which also works with Flickr's API to download several images and print out their metadata onto the conole. It's still a work in progress with a few bugs to fix up, but some of the key features include:  \n\n\n* Async/Await when downloading images from Flickr\n* Dependancy injection to be able to parse byte arrays regardless of whether they're Big Endian or Little Endian\n* Reflection to find all types that implement a specific interface (this helps to identify main segment markers within an image's byte array)\n* Replaced byte arrays with Span<byte> to improve performance\n\nThis was intended to only be a small project, but it turns out that the EXIF spec isn't as simple as I thought - a lot of the metadata can be nested/offset, and each segments can vary wildly in size.   \n\n\nSo my question is, with no CS degree (I have a first class degree in music, which I'm downplaying as I know it's hugely unrelated!) am I in a realistic position to get a job?",

        "body": "Hey guys, \n\nI'm an undergrad coming to the end of sophomore year right now. I'm currently taking two intro CS classes because I'm considering a CS degree. The first half of the semester was really fun, and I recognize that I felt it was fun because I was in a flow state ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow\\_(psychology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))), ie. the coding challenges were difficult and pushed me to my limits, but were still doable so that the accomplishment of getting the code right felt so fucking rewarding. \n\nFast forward to this week. I just received a 50% on last week's coding assignment, and the deadline for this week's assignment is in 22 hours, and I haven't even started. I'll be honest, I'm bad at consistency, and halfway into every semester, I lose motivation and can't seem to maintain a healthy lifestyle while keeping up with my studies. However, I've been able to do well in other subjects like the social sciences and humanities (just for context, I have a 3.9 GPA \u2014 although this might change after my CS classes) because I'm pretty good at cram studying for exams and doing work last minute. Consistency isn't important in  humanities, but it seems to be integral to CS and STEM subjects. \n\nAs a result, I've been thinking about what I like about learning CS and what I don't. \n\nWhat I like: \n\n\\- I'm getting important 21st century knowledge that gives me access to previously inaccessible spaces, like employment, culture, and general life options\n\n\\- I feel challenged in a way I've never felt before. \n\n\\- I genuinely feel excited learning about CS. \n\n\n\nWhat I don't like: \n\n\\- No time to rest. Once the semester starts, you can't put a pause on your studies or reflect on what you learned. You have no control over your life for a couple months (or at least that's my experience). \n\n\\- So many math prerequisites...\n\n\n\nIt seems to me that the structure of university classes just isn't conducive for me to learn CS, which brings me to my question. I want to know whether there are certain skills that a CS university education can give you, that a CS bootcamp (or online courses) cannot. Obviously, there has to be a lot \u2014 I mean, a few months of intensive learning definitely cannot compare to four years of education. To my understanding, a bootcamp focuses solely on coding, but a CS degree teaches you a lot of theory. But due to my ignorance, I don't know what the actual usefulness/practical application of CS university courses (theory or not) is, so please enlighten me.  \n\n\n\nBtw, I know a bootcamp also cannot be paused midway, but I feel like a couple months of no control is better than two years (from where I am now) of no control.\n\nEdit: I can see the limitations of a bootcamp - it\u2019s definitely just the beginning of the learning process for bootcampers. It sounds like a lot of people see university as the best path to becoming a software engineer, which is probably true, but what if someone just really isn\u2019t compatible with the structure of university? Are there alternative options, or am I just gonna be in perpetual disadvantage if I don\u2019t major in CS? Any success stories from non CS majors?",

Now an analyst job opened up in that department, and I'm thinking if I should apply or just apply in a faster growing software company in the same industry, where both tech and logistics are their core competencies.\n\n**Option A: Apply for Operations Analyst position within same company**\n\n**PROS**\n\n* I'll be able to lead or be part of the team involved in implementing projects I'm excited about (does not necessarily mean I\u2019ll be building products, but at least I\u2019ll gain greater domain expertise and greater impact)\n* Great pay and benefit\n* I'll gain greater domain expertise, and with that, can move to a software company focused in logistics industry\n\n**CONS**\n\n* My ideal goal of becoming a technical product manager may most likely not happen here, and I'll most likely be a senior analyst instead if I stay for the long run\n* Knowing what they do, potentially stressful\n\n**MAYBE PRO or CON**\n\n* Reporting directly to the head honcho or 2nd highest person of that department I plan to apply for\n* Maybe limited career growth in the long run because of the flat company hierarchy\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Option B: Stay with current role and wait for better options in a different company**\n\n**PROS**\n\n* Have the option to find better career trajectory and fit with a high growth logistics software company that can equally appreciate my tech and logistics background\n* I'll still be working towards being a project manager  (close enough to product manager, except managing roll outs of out-of-box solutions, and not creating them), and can potentially move to become technical product manager in the long run\n* I have a great manager and coworkers who are happy to help me grow professionally\n\n**CONS**\n\n* If I don't find that other \"better option outside\", my career (and pay) will be stunted regardless if I stay in my department since it's not my current company's core competency.\n* I'll continue working on things I don't find as fulfilling\n* The grass is not always greener on the other side\n* In the long run, I know I'll need to move on to a software company focused in logistics industry anyway if I want to be a technical product manager\n* Maybe I won't find that other unicorn company after all\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "body": "tl;dr: I'm an hourly worker being converted into full time, how do I negotiate salary? \n\n\\---\n\nI'm someone who is an hourly contractor. There's a recruitment company X which is paid money for each hour of work that I do at company Y. Then company X gives me a cut of that money. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's a salary position at company Y which opened up. Company Y reached out to me and asked me if I'd like to be converted over to a salary employee at company Y. I ended up in a zoom call with a recruiter, who asked me if I was interviewing with anyone else (I said no). She asked how many years of experience I had. She asked me for the name of Company X. I know it sounds a bit sketchy that a recruiter from Company Y doesn't know the name of Company X but... after what I've seen of company Y so far, I'm not surprised. And she asked me what my salary expectations were.\n\nI didn't give her the salary expectation number because I've read that you don't want to give the number incase you low ball yourself, and you really have no idea what the compensation range is. So I just asked her what the compensation band for the position was (I'm following the advice from here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9BoG1n1948](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9BoG1n1948)). She said it's confidential. \n\nI asked for the compensation structure so that I make a more informed decision. She listed the benefits of the company including paid time off, and the fact that there's a bonus based on performance. I asked for around what amount of money the bonus could be, and she said she didn't know. I ended up just asking if we could take this over email so I could think about it more, and asked if she could send information explaining the compensation structure and benefits. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe sent me an email and that email contained information about the health benefits. Nothing about the actual amount of PTO, or what the amounts of the bonuses would, or anything anything about the compensation structure. I replied back and asked to clarification on the compensation structure and amount of paid time off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really don't know how to approach this. Although I'm trying to adhere to a few things:\n\n1) In a respectful way, I'm NOT going to give her a salary expectation number. She can give me the offer.\n\n2) If my hourly rate is A, then I expect my salary to be 2\\*A in thousand minimum. If she gives me less, screw that, I'll just continue being a contractor as I'll literally be making more money that way. And then go find another job when my contract is close to being up.  \n\n3) I will NOT tell her what my hourly rate at company X is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo these 3 things sound like they're good ideas? And also, is there any tips you guys know of? I've browsed the wiki, and in 1 link, it was suggested to use glassdoor to get an idea of the salary at the company. At another link, it was said that information in sites like glassdoor is wildly out of date. And it does seem out of date... based on what my hourly rate is, I think the salaries on glassdoor need to be updated.",

        "body": "I live just outside of Miami, FL and I started a job  months ago with a firm out in the Northeast. I accepted this job with the expectation on both sides that this would be a long-term remote position. Much of the yoke of the staff is in the Boston area and used to travel to the office, but we've been expanding for remote roles since we are growing, me being one of them.\n\nHowever, since COVID is waning in the U.S, the executives have decided that the engineering, product, and data teams should be co-located, so they are looking for new office spaces in the city. They are also expecting me (nothing explicit yet but from my one-on-ones with my super I can smell it coming)  to be part of the move, even though we've had negotiations that I would remain in the South.\n\nI was hired as a Staff engineer for this company, and frankly I've been very, *very* productive over the past several months since I've been here (both in terms of product output as well as changes to infrastructure and strategy). I can remain productive here at home while I can still be close to my family, friends, and my roots.\n\nI \\*am\\* open to potentially relocating, but it depends not only my emotional state, but also what the company can do for me in terms of relocation and long-term stability within the company (tbf, the company is probably going to explode in growth). CoL between Miami and Boston is about 20-25% increase, so I am thinking of having that as a non-negotiable (along with moving cost paid for).\n\nI'm willing to walk away if need be, but I also don't want to interview again (lol) but more importantly also potentially be in a situation like this where I could be in this situation again.\n\nAgain, it's all implicit right now, but I'd rather be prepared now than have to face potential negotiation or a new job search without much warning time. Since I've never had this type of scenario occur (nor had to relocate for a job), I have some questions that I'm hoping some friendly internet strangers can help me with if you've had any experience.

I've had multiple interviews, but haven't been able to pass a single technical interview yet.  I'm feeling really, really discouraged.  What's frustrating though, beyond just getting rejected, is the complete and utter lack of any feedback.  It's just leaving me feeling a bit aimless on where to improve.\n\nThe specific interview I mentioned in the title of the post kind of blind-sided me.  For one thing, it was described as a \"HackerRank interview\" so I naturally assumed that it was going to be almost entirely leetcode-esque questions (and that's what I prepared for).  Instead, there was a single easy leetcode question and about 45 minutes of system design discussion.  I spent a good 2/3 of this question stumbling and looking like a deer in headlights.  For a little added context, this interview involved a lot of really involved discussion about database architecture and design, which is something I have effectively zero experience with. I work with databases often and I'm heavily involved in design discussions in the context of my team's work, but there are entire teams at my company who are responsible for systems and database architecture.  \n\n**Has this given me an unrealistic sense of what's expected of the average developer?**  I am well aware that interviewers don't necessarily expect you to have comprehensive knowledge of all of the topics they ask you about and they want to know how you approach a problem.  That said, there seemed to be a significant enough lack of knowledge on my end that I couldn't even really meet the interviewer in the middle.  \n\n\n*TL;DR - what do you expect of a back-end developer with 1.5 YOE? Would you expect proficiency in systems and database design?*",

I graduated a few months ago with a bachelors degree in chemistry and everything I know about coding, I taught myself either at night or sitting at CS classes whenever I could. Yesterday I found that post on the frontpage of this sub that basically says if you don't love coding, you shouldn't bother with it.\n\nAnd for some weird reason I really took it to heart. I mean, I actually like coding. I have a dozen or so OS contributions (small bug fixes or stuff like implementing a copy function for a window pane of a desktop application) and I thought it was a lot of fun getting code reviewed by experienced devs and working with other people (something I obviously couldn't do at university). It still feels like whenever I read something, be it here or elsewhere, people make it out to be this insurmountable task, like you have to live and breathe code or you're gonna get fired. Which is probably my biggest fear. The poster above mentioned stand-ups where you absolutely have to bring in results or you're (quoting) fucked. How do you even face the reality that you wasted years of your life on something only to realize you're not good enough?\n\nI keep trying to catch up whenever I feel down, at first, it was data structures. I went to the library and read through books over the course of a month while trying out Advent of Code to see if I really \"got it\". I managed to complete all puzzles from 2015-2020 without much outside help over the course of around a year, and for a few days, it felt like I managed to keep my impostor syndrome in check.\n\nUntil I realized I only know about backend programming and not much about full stack programming or client-server models. So I started up reading on HTML and CSS. I built a Spring Boot application for movie collection management using Hibernate, Thymeleaf and Spring Data JPA creating my own views. Another few months went by and I realized I don't know anything about cryptography. So I went back to the library to read up on it. It was of course only shallow knowledge but I still felt like I absolutely need to know it to make it as a developer.\n\nWhich brings me to my last point. Which is that I never feel ready, and whatever I do or learn I never will. Its just way too much knowledge and I feel so overwhelmed with it all, how can anyone know all this stuff and still have time to do other things? The post on the front page made me feel really bad, to the point where I just want to throw the towel in and continue chemistry instead even though I prefer coding.\n\nI have no idea why I am even making this post, does anyone else feel this way?

        "body": "This is going to be long, and I would really appreciate any input/advice.\n\n**Background:** I go to a very small liberal arts college in the northeast US. Due to this, I'm not really exposed to the tech industry or highly competitive CS programs like at CMU and other target schools. My college also has virtually no name recognition outside of academic circles. I'm not lamenting this, I love my college, professors, and peers, it's just reality.\n\nTo help with this I've done 3 relevant internships (in order starting with most recent):\n\n1. Application Dev at a large local company (using .NET & MySQL)\n2. Backend Web Dev at a non-profit (PHP, MySQL, and Wordpress)\n3. Cyber Security at a fortune 25 (soft skills, didn't do a whole lot)\n\nI also have a few projects which are a CRUD application written in PHP & MySQL, another CRUD app written using JS & Bootstrap, and an Arduino project I did using C++.\n\nAcademically I was also appointed to be a teaching fellow by faculty (this also is work experience as it's a paid position) and finished the semester with a 4.2 GPA. My overall GPA is a 3.7 due to a low grade I received in Calculus which brings me to one of my main concerns. \n\nI chose to do a BA and haven't taken a math class above Calc I. This has given me a really great GPA and allowed me to pursue my non-stem interests in philosophy and Africana studies. However, I'm worried this could hurt me during the interview process as I've never taken linear algebra. I do very well in my CS classes to make up for this but I know math and CS normally go hand in hand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dilemma:** Before this year I didn't have my most recent internship secured, wasn't asked to be a teaching fellow, and had a 3.4 GPA. I was honestly really scared of what my job outlook would look like after graduation. I didn't think I would be able to find a decent job at all, let alone an internship this summer. Now, after everything that has happened, my outlook has changed a lot and I'm wondering what I should do. \n\nI don't go to a target school, I only have a BA, no FAANG internships, but I have what I have listed. Should I go grind leetcode and LinkedIn to get into larger companies? Is that even possible given my credentials? Is it worth it for me to accept a local job first to gain more experience or would that be selling myself short?\n\nI'm not really sure how my credentials look from an outsider perspective, I know this might come off as attention seeking but I genuinely have nobody to talk to about this. I'm stuck at home and none of my professors or classmates can really help since we're all in the same boat. \n\nMy main questions are essentially: \n\n1. Are big tech companies a possibility with my situation? \n2. Is it worth it to accept a job at a local non-tech company first or would that be selling myself short?\n3. If those companies are out of reach where might be a good sect to start gaining experience (defense contractor, non-tech, bio-tech/pharma, startup, etc.)?\n4. Should I grind leetcode or do another project using more modern frameworks/tools (react, electron, AWS, kubernetes, etc.)\n\nOverall I'm just wondering where I stand post grad, and I really appreciate any responses and sorry if this seems like a stupid/indirect question.",

Other than that, among companies that I applied to, very few of which replied within 2-3 days saying the position has been filled, while most of them completely ghosted. Also, I have very hard times finding jobs for New Grad at this point (I notice most companies seem to be looking for Junior and Senior positions).\n\nIs it gonna be hopeless until the end of this pandemic? I am very desperate and seeing nothing for the near future. I'd really appreciate some advice on finding SWE/iOS jobs for new grad.\n\nThank you, I hope you all are staying safe and healthy!",

With that just said, what advice can you give on someone like me? I've been applying many times on linkedin and haven't got any luck. All I've had are spam emails from different Indian recruiters and scam companies like revature, esolutions-inc and the like. I dont really mind what work it is, as long as it's IT related, but i would mostly prefer as an android developer if given the chance since its the one that i have most experience with.

Beware: longboi \n\nWent from a kid obsessed with minecraft and modding etc to having a rough time in my late teens. \n\nAfter hitting the bottom, I decided to seriously start looking at programming, so worked part time and coded in my spare time. I fell in love again, it suits how I think. It was like being a child, flowing for ages, gave me so much happiness and fulfilment to make something!\n\nTook it further and landed myself an apprenticeship with a boot camp style coding school who were partnered with a mystery company. The company are huge but are not an industry that lines with my values as a person!\n\nStayed on with said company who are using their own custom made adaptation of Tcl (tickle). Gained lots of knowledge on Linux, backend dev, creating schemas, stored procedures, relational diagrams schemas, docker, how the development lifecycle works, as well as much more + picking up good coding practices along the way, got a few certifications under my belt from Microsoft and BCS too. \n\nMost of their codebase is legacy code with next to no documentation on how things work. Lots of tech debt which isn\u2019t being cleaned up. Unsafe practices. I\u2019ve put some suggestions in and raised concerns for all. \n\nI raised my concerns for lack of learning too. manager told me not to worry. \u201cYou\u2019ll pick this all up in 10 years and be a senior, don\u2019t worry\u201d. Things are very old school here. A good friend, colleague and even better senior dev told me that if I want progression and a good cv, this company is not the place. Alarm bells were ringing and my passion was beginning to be snuffed out.\n\nThe little learning I get is very narrow and specific to the company. I\u2019ve asked for further training to understand the deeper whys, methods and technicalities of programming, if that makes sense? So I can be a better and more knowledgeable dev + be more adaptable to new languages, frameworks etc if the company was to adopt them. Put presentations to my managers, a case and why I\u2019m passionate to learn more and progress.\n\nHave been asking for a mentor for months. Been denied all of it. I get one day of textbook learning per quarter :/\n\nI\u2019m just so stressed and sad because my heart isn\u2019t in this job. I feel bad to leave. I\u2019ve poured my heart into doing long days because I loved what I was creating. Now, that passion has gone. I feel exhausted, depressed and burdened by my job. It\u2019s been almost two years here and I need to take another step forwards.\n\nI love my own projects and I teach myself for an hour, minimum, most days. My passion for tech is still there, undying. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of going to uni or getting a part time job in a cafe and volunteering my skills for an amazing project that lines up with the way that the world is going + my core values, see where it takes me and as always do my damn best!\n\nWhat do you all think? It\u2019s been brewing for a while but I can\u2019t take anymore! The straw has broken the camel\u2019s back and he\u2019s now off work with stress!",

        "body": "Hello all,\n\nI am in my early twenties and have three credits left towards a bachelors degree in urban planning. As an undergraduate, I focused on more legal and social studies based classes because I wanted to focus on a career in community development, and housing in particular.\n\nHowever, after multiple internships working in the field, I have come to the conclusion that this work is not for me. I work better with \u201cthings\u201d rather than \u201cpeople\u201d, and simply do not have the emotional stamina to support others in difficult situations day in and day out.  I am looking for a way to change careers to something that suits me better and is more sustainable.\n\nI have always been interested in science and technology but mistakenly thought I was too dumb to pursue it, as I did not get good grades in high school. (I have a average/good university GPA, however)  It is not financially viable for me to go to graduate school at the moment but I was wondering if there was still a way for me to make a career change soon.\n\nI have some beginner-level python programming experience, as well as experience in R and ArcGIS from undergrad. I would say that I am able to complete small projects with these tools if I have clear instructions, but would not consider myself proficient enough to the point that I am employable. \n\nI am very interested in working in GIS because I find it interesting and liked using it in undergrad. It also seems to be a very stable career choice, which attracts me to it. \n\nI see a lot of GIS jobs also like to see experience in Python and SQL, so I am also interested in developing these skills.\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew of resources to help me develop a higher level of proficiency in ArcGIS and Python, as well as to begin to learn SQL? In particular, I am interested in resources that would help me create projects to put in a portfolio or have some sort of certification at the end, as I feel like that would help keep me motivated to complete it and it might be helpful to be able to put something on a resume.\n\nI am not opposed to paying for a course or program as long as it is helpful, high quality and relatively inexpensive. I think I may still have access to ArcGIS from my university as I am technically still a student. I have been thinking of receiving a two semester GIS certificate at a local community college as I knock out my last remaining credit requirement but would like to explore cheaper, more DIY options first, especially since I will be working full time. I am a bit frustrated looking for courses online because they seem to assume you are a complete beginner to coding and many don\u2019t let you skip ahead. \n\n\nWould building a portfolio and brushing up on skills with online classes be able to help me get my foot in the door or am I better off getting the certificate at college or waiting until I can go to graduate school? \n\nThank you in advance for any advice or suggestions!",

        "body": "I'm the guy who posted [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kpr2iu/spent_2_years_unemployed_after_graduation_finally/) [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lp2xff/started_a_new_job_2_months_ago_hate_it_and_dont/) threads. TL;DR: I was unemployed for 2 years after graduating in 2019, got some offers rescinded in 2020 due to COVID, finally got a job this January. It was supposedly a \"Smalltalk\" position that turned out to involve a proprietary framework, which is basically a double whammy in terms of increasing my market value for other dev positions since these skills are basically non-transferrable. \n\nLong story short, I absolutely hate this job. Trash pay ($60k) in a high COL area (Miami). I'm extremely demotivated at work because I'm acutely aware that I'm working with obsolete, proprietary tech that there's absolutely no demand for in the job market, which is already bad due to COVID.\n\nThe only slight silver lining about this job was that it was fully remote due to COVID, but in late April we got a company-wide CC informing us that the executives or whoever's in charge of making these decisions wants the entire team bAcK tO tHe OfFiCe a minimum of 3 days a week starting in June. This means that on top of hating my job, I'm now taking a cut to my already trash-tier pay (since I'll have to commute an hour a day, which will significantly increase my gas bill) and I'll have to spend an hour of my day commuting to some cramped shithole open office just so that middle managers can micromanage me or so coworkers can tap me on the shoulder every 10 minutes to chitchat, or forcibly having to listen in on other people's chitchat because everyone is sitting 2 feet away from each other. In sum, I hate working in the office and I don't want to go back.\n\nSo I've been fervently applying to other jobs ever since I posted my 2nd thread. I've had a few interviews since then, and I just recently made it to the final stage of a fully remote JavaScript/React position that was basically a perfect fit for me - much better pay, obviously much better actually in-demand tech stack, and most importantly, it was fully and permanently remote. The team was extremely impressed with me and I crushed my final interview last Monday, made it to the offer stage. I eased up on applying, because the senior devs I had my final interview with made it pretty clear during my final interview that this was a done deal and they were going to extend an offer. A week of radio silence goes by, then on Friday I get an email from the CEO notifying me that the person who was going to leave the company had decided to stay. They made it clear that I had done very well on the interviews, and they really tried to see if they could expand the team to make bring me aboard, but they weren't sure if they were ready to expand their team given the iffy COVID economy, but they would like to \"stay in touch\" and reach out if something changes in the future (obviously this won't happen, it was basically a \"sorry, better luck next time\" rejection).\n\nGetting this email crushed me. I spent the entire weekend depressed. This was a long and arduous interview process and it involved a take-home project that took me a full day and a half to do. I'm now 2 weeks out from going back to the office with zero prospects lined up. I'm back to frantically shotgunning applications for remote positions on every job site I know of, but haven't heard a thing yet (other than automated rejections) and I almost certainly won't hear anything before it's time to go back to the office at my current job. The worst part of all this is that I will now have MUCH less leeway to apply to jobs and interview. It's impossible for me to interview while I'm at the office because it's an open office environment with no privacy, and it's not like I can just have 10 tabs of job sites open when my computer screen is fully visible to the entire team if they just look over my shoulder (including managers).\n\nI've seen people on this board talk about \"working with recruiters\" who you send your resume to and then they basically find a position that fits your needs/qualifications for you. My question is, how or where do you find these people? The only \"recruiting firms\" I've seen are basically websites that have a \"job seekers\" tab that is basically just a shittier version of LinkedIn/Indeed where they index a bunch of open positions that you can apply to. Where are these recruiters who will take my resume and work with me 1-on-1 to help me find a permanently remote position? I can't find them. I'd appreciate some help on this. I'm literally losing sleep and my appetite, can't enjoy my afternoons anymore because every day I look at the calendar I'm a day close to going back to the fucking office. I've actually considered just quitting this job with nothing else lined up if nothing turns up by June, because I just can't stomach the thought of going back to the office anymore.",

I'm one month into the interview process and I've done some good ones and never have I ever been through the dehumanizing experience I just went through.\n\nThis was a round 3 interview after I met with the VP and CTO of a 50-201 employee company. They liked my experience and loved that I spent Covid getting new skills up...they were both very well aware that I am a WordPress guy moving into full stack and react. The \"developer lead\" who interviewed me had absolutely no idea what he was doing. He started with reviewing recent projects of mine...when I told him the most recent one had a ruby on rails API as the backend he seemed to not want to talk about it because it was out of his tech stack. \n\nSo we moved onto an express/node project of mine and he started asking me questions that had nothing to do with the project. Everytime I told him we can look at the code and I can walk you through whatever questions u have on it he started getting angrier (he had a thick accent - I'm 1st gen american so I come from similar accented people). He never once looked at the code for my project or the deployed site. Just consistently berated me with ultra specific questions that he wanted me to code on the Zoom Chat Window. I slapped together a few json objects that I thought he was asking for but he never even looked at them. His English was a little broken and he was very angry so it was hard to understand. Before he even looked at my json object he moved over to AWS lightsail which I've used once in my life - I've used godaddy's hosting for 7 years. I told him what I knew about it and with no response he went to asking about Redux in React which I'm also pretty new to.\n\nLong story short...this guy had a screw loose and my brain is still trying to comprehend WTF just happened. After speaking with the VP and CTO I had completely different expectations for this interview. I was specifically told by the VP to not worry about brushing up on anything and to just be myself. The complete 180 in attitude and demeanor of this interviewer has me questioning what I'm doing on this planet now.\n\nThe position was for a entry/junior full stack developer.\n\nI am pretty confident I won't get the job, I will hear from them this week.\n\n\nUpdate- did not get the job lol",

Well it went pretty good, but after 6 months our CTO had to step down for health reasons so I was forced to took over that role. I must confess I was pretty scared to manage a development team and being responsible for much more things in the corporate environment, but I took that as an opportunity to grow and develop other skills. And also, after a couple of months I would be more experienced and comfortable in that role, right?\n\nWell, I don't feel like it. Two years have passed by since that promotion and even when my teammates, devs, and superiors feel I'm better at that position than our previous CTO, this is starting to affect my personal life. I am now responsible for developing, testing, QA, customers installations, leading a team, and requirement analysis and I don't have time to do everything now unless I put +60hs a week (which I don't think is healthy). Plus, my boss is really into micromanagement and scope creeping which is making our work harder.\n\nIn the last year, after continuous up and downs and fuckups that culminated last Wednesday when an important customer cancelled an installation after seeing our product was unfinished, my boss suddenly decided to throw me under the bus. To an extent I was to blame (after all I'm the CTO) but I saw this fuckup coming 4 months back, when every week I requested my boss to give us a testing environment and a demo environment separate from our dev environment (which, according to his orders, we couldn't test there). He always said \"sure, i'll create it right soon\" but then nothing happened. This last time I felt betrayed though.\n\nAfter having in account that most of the problems we've faced and are currently facing could've been avoided if he listened to me and my team, I'm now starting to think if I should leave. Many times before I've suggested my boss how to improve our workflow and version control and he always promised to be part of it and listen to me, but nothing ever changed. This last time was not and exception\n\nSo I'm now temped to leave this company and start over in another one as a dev, which is what actually I want to do most, but I'm not still sure if I should give another shot here at improving things, or neither do not know how to communicate to my boss I'm no longer happy here.

It's very hard to convince them to say something to my face, even when I frame it as \"please tell me what the problem is so maybe I can help or do a better job\", but some recent events got me suspicious, and I have figured out that it's way worse than I thought. They've probably been saying horrible things about me for years. I think they're firing me soon but idk when, and I don't care tbh. I also don't really care anymore about what their problem with me is exactly.\n\nI don't want to make this too long by saying everything that happened bc it's been four years of working there, but I'll go into those recent events that I mentioned. Through Slack's screen share, I saw a coworker's slack conversation that he left open, about me. They said things like \"no one likes working with him\" and \"it seems there's no one else available to, we're fucked\" (because I was put on a project with them). This got me suspicious and I started thinking about other stuff that happened, and realized that, while I already knew how they are, it's probably way worse than I thought.\n\nI also asked my boss, regarding people who has been complaining to him about me (not about this incident per se), to please tell me what the problem is so maybe I can help, but he didn't respond for several days.\n\nAs to why this is happening, I'm not sure because they don't say much to me. Maybe they started shit talking me for some reason and it snowballed from there, which I've seen happen to others, or maybe it's something I did.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I know that nothing justifies this sort of behavior on their part, but maybe there's still something that I'm doing that bothers them and is the reason for this. When I first started working here I did extra good at first, to give a good first impression, and later kinda toned it down, so to speak. I'm still getting the job done, I don't actually miss deadlines, but idk, maybe they expect a different level of involvement with the job. And that's ok, if they were respectful about it.\n\nFrom what I could gather, they have accussed me of missing deadlines due to deadlines they didn't tell me about, or bugs being detected after delivering something. They also told me that I should respond to Slack faster now that we're working from home. Those are the only two concrete complaints I could get from them. Besides that, I get a feeling that they do expect a different level of involvement with the job from me, so to speak, as in, they're the kind of people who tries to be the best, tries to get promotions etc, and expect the same from me, and it bothers them that I'm more chill about it.\n\nI will try to do those things even though I'm sure I'll get fired anyway. Just so they can't legitimately claim I didn't do a good job when that happens. I'll try to prevent bugs in my code, and to respond more quickly to Slack despite having Intellij on full screen (im not the only one at all who takes a while when I'm busy, but its still something I can work on since it bothers them).\n\nAnyway the thing is, I'm done with these guys. Like I said, it's ok if they expect me to be more involved with the job, or if there's stuff they want me to change about the way I work, but constantly saying shit about me behind my back, refusing to say it to my face when confronted, and ignoring me, isn't. \n\nI hate them at this point. I hate my boss and most of my coworkers. I think they're pathetic, their personal lives are empty and a failure, the only reason they talk about promotions and raises all the time is that the only way they can have someone in their lives is if they have money and financial stability to offer, and that this whole thing probably boils down to the fact that I'm not like them. And I don't care about what people like that thinks about me tbh.",

I eventually was able to understand the logic behind 1 question but I didnt feel like I really progressed. \n\nThen I went to Udemy to do some online courses aaaaaaand yup. Tutorial Honeymoon phase. I felt like I was progressing and doing actual programming. Once I wanted to try to do what I\u2019ve learned on my own, I realized, I had no idea how to start.\n\nOnce I decided to make my own projects, (and I emphasize that this is the crucial turning point to start the upswing) things started to click and connect. \n\nI started by literally spending a whole day just memorizing how to create a project:\nnpx create-react-app [project name], cd [project name], npm start. Then slowly but surely, I Googled and YouTubed what I wanted to do. It was a simple React Counting app, then I wanted to learn Hooks, then I wanted to learn CSS... it just kept snowballing. Before I knew it, I had my own portfolio website, a couple of projects I\u2019ve completed on my own and I felt ready to apply. \n\nApplying is a numbers game. I applied to 10 jobs a day for 3 months straight. I\u2019ve gotten maybe 15 calls in those 3 months. Of the 15 calls, 6 of them gave me a chance with a technical test, and of those 6 chances, I\u2019ve failed 5 of them. The one I didnt fail? I made it to the final round of interviewing only to lose because someone else just had more experience than me. \n\nI was tired and drained but not too long after that final round silver medal, I got an email offer.\n\nI\u2019ve never been so happy to get an offer in my life. All the struggle was worth it. I would also like to say that I identify as a \u201cgifted burnout\u201d and I did therapy to help me overcome my \u201cchild prodigy\u201d ego or whatever you wanna call it. \n\nIf you feel like you\u2019re past your prime or you cant learn to program, learn from a gifted-burnout-slacker like me. You CAN. Believe in yourself. Keep going. Its a marathon, and I\u2019ll see you on the other side of the finish line.",

I'm just responsible for storing (historical) data in table format and displaying it in reports/dashboards. There's also a pretty considerable business component involved.   \nNow I was just wondering: is this field \"future-proof\" and will there be a market for these skills in say 5-10 years?

I do feel as though I should earn my way to a degree). Worked hard but voiced concerns about salary many times through the year. CEO very personable, kind guy (we've hung out off hours) but seems a little...exploitative\n   * SaaS flopped, switched to consulting business midway through at a modest profit. \n* **Year 4 (Current)** \\- 10% raise to 77k (extremely low at skill level), 3% equity (for a consultancy, doesn't mean too much to me), 2% bonus of all revenue beyond 300k. **Still haven't gotten this in writing** (something to do with lawyers, etc.)\n   * Brought 2 new employees into the company, ramped them up and managed them while working on my own contracts\n   * Needed healthcare this year, CEO zoom called me and said I would need to pay 300$/month. I snapped back when I mentioned my coworker was paying only 90$/month, he backed off and it was resolved.\n   * Lost belief in the companies success partially due to project management on the CEO side, partially due to the nature of the business which was 'anything for the money' type contract jobs. \n   * Got an offer without even trying at 130k+, accepted it to start in 4 weeks. Told boss, gave 3 weeks (I want to take a week off), he called to tell me he was disappointed I wouldn't do all I could to prepare them for my absence (he was trying to get 5 weeks out of me).

This went on for a month or so then I started applying for more automation jobs on Upwork and other freelancing websites and got into QA without knowing what it really is. I was approached by a guy who worked in a company and he outsourced his work to me. Now as I worked there for 4 months, I decided to apply to more QA Jobs myself, and started reading about QA. Now I have 2 interviews upcoming this week and all I read here and elsewhere is that once you get into QA it is impossible to get out of it and you also get looked down upon and it doesn't look good on your resume if you apply to SDE Jobs. I am too newbie to understand the chemistry but does this mean I should not take these Jobs even if I pass the interview?\n\nI don't actually love the QA work but I don't hate it, I love automating the stuff but it's not that actually. I am too confused. My coding skills are okay, not very sharp and I have few projects in my plate but nothing too crazy too show off. Should I now continue this path and work on myself alongside and make the switch when my degree end next year in June or should I just drop this idea and keep working on my projects and get the deveopment jobs. I don't have any internships yet but I am looking for one. Also I have two projects at the moment both QA, both from persons who won't work but outsource, and pay me less.   \nI am new to this sub, please show some mercy :)",

        "body": "I know this might seem like a straightforward \"duh\" answer, but I'd love some advice here. I'm looking at two job offers right now. One will give me a raise of only $10K initially. However; it comes with bonuses, benefits, and I'll no longer have to drive to an office. It's 100% remote work and won't change. My wife can stay in the job she's in, we don't have to move and my son will stay in his current school. He's 5 years old.\n\nThe second one would be at least a $50K raise. However, we would have to move to a new state. From Texas to Florida. The cost of living where we could move to would be a little higher. The new job offers no benefits at all. My wife would lose about $5K in her salary. We would probably just use her insurance from her new job to cover us all if she can secure a new position (teacher) I'd be back to driving about half an hour to forty-five minutes to the office and back each day.\n\nIf I were single, I'd jump right to Florida. However; I'm not sure if after everything is said and done if the 50K will be worth it. What would you do?\n\nEdit:\n1. 80K to 90K with full benefits, no move, fully remote. Bonuses could add an additional $15-25K.\n\nVs \n\n2. 80K to 130K with no benefits, moving, commuting, no bonuses. \n\nCurrently renting a home at 1600/m, to match what we have here we\u2019d need to rent at least at 2200/m from what we\u2019ve seen.",

        "body": "I recently went for  technical interviews at two different companies for a junior full stack  dev role (I have less than 1 year of working experience). Lets call them  company A and B.\n\nCompany A is a medium sized \"start up\" which has been running for  about 10 years now, and has great ratings on glassdoor (4.1). For my  first technical interview, I was given an easy to medium difficulty  algorithm questions. The interviewer was a senior engineer in the  company who seemed really helpful and had a normal level of peoples  skills. In my second technical interview in this company, I was tasked  to design (but the code didnt have to compile) a system that worked like  a forum with posts and upvotes in a pair programming format with  another engineer. They wanted to see how I would approach the problem  and were willing to give me hints when I was stuck. In the final round  of interview, I spoke with the VP of engineering over video call and the  dude seemed super passionate. I'm currently awaiting for my interview  result from this company.\n\nCompany B seems like a unicorn startup which is currenty pre-IPO and  also has really good ratings on glassdoor (4.1). For my interview in  company B, i was first given an online MCQ test. I scored miserably with  a score of 18/100, but they decided to give me a chance to progress  with the next round of technical interviews. During the next round of  technical interviews, the interviewer who I had not met before,  immediately jumped into asking the technical questions without first  introducing himself or what the team does. He gave me two medium level  algorithm questions where I had to code on google docs. He was extremely  quiet and when I got stuck for 15 minutes and asked for hints, he told  me to think a little bit more (what kind of hint is that...).  Surprisingly, I managed to complete the algorithm questions and am  scheduled for the next round of interview with this company, where they  will be testing me on medium to hard level algorithm questions. I am  expecting to flunk the interview by the way.\n\nMy gut feeling tells me that company B will not be a great working  experience if my colleagues are going to be like my interviewer, however  I'm not sure if this is just because I'm scared of the upcoming  technical interview with them. Does anything I mentioned above seem like  red flags for either company?",

I graduated with a CS degree and a minor in math, with a 3.34 gpa. I never had an internship, except for a program I did my senior year of high school with Texas Instruments, which was basically an internship but mostly focused on electrical engineering (I was part of an engineering academy program at my high school before majoring in CS.)\n\nMy current strengths are Java, since that\u2019s what most of my college courses used, and I have decent experience solving easy and medium LeetCode problems (in Java) (solved 100+ easy and 100+ medium so far).\n\nMy GitHub doesn\u2019t have anything extraordinary, but I have a lot of the LeetCode problems I\u2019ve solved on there, many with an explanation of how I approached the problem. I have some repositories I made while learning a programming language or while taking a Udemy course that just has basic code, and I have 1 personal project I made with Java. I\u2019m also planning to add some stuff I made in the past (2 games while in high school, 1 thing I made on my own, and another one I did in college in a group). www.github.com/21david is my GitHub.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve been considering a bootcamp called App Academy. Should I do App Academy? It is 4 months long and teaches Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and other tools for full stack web development.\n\nBefore considering this, I was learning android app development (using Kotlin) on Udemy and was just planning to do that, make a few apps, also learn iOS development and cross-platform development, and then try to find a job as a mobile developer.\nShould I keep learning app development until I\u2019ve made a few apps? Should I just apply now for whatever jobs I can for Java or Kotlin jobs? I think pretty much all job applications that I see have requirements that I do not meet. First of all, many require 1 or more years of experience required, which I don\u2019t have, and second, many require things I have no experience in. Things I never tried out, some quick examples might be Java Spring, database stuff, other tools, etc. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t really know what to do. Maybe this is a good reason to do a bootcamp, because they will guide me and teach many things college didn\u2019t. I feel like doing a bootcamp makes up for not having had a relevant internship.\n\nBut I feel like I\u2019m taking a risk. What if I don\u2019t like the technologies I learn, or what if I don\u2019t like full stack web development? Although I did enjoy the web development courses I took earlier (like last month or before). And I did want to learn JavaScript. Ruby is meh though, I don\u2019t think I enjoy learning and using it as much as Kotlin and Java.\n\nOn the other hand I was enjoying learning app development with Kotlin and I feel like this kind of interrupted that.\n\nSorry if this was a long post.\n\nTl;dr\nGraduated college 5 months ago, 3.34 gpa, no internships during college, some stuff on my GitHub, nothing extraordinary. Considering a boot camp, or teaching myself app development until I find a job. Not sure where to go from here though.",

        "body": "Long story short, I graduated 2 years ago with a BA in accounting and I started doing an MS in computer science. I spent most of my time self-study to catch up with my classmates since they had a pretty \"heavy\" history with computer science (doing BS in CS, some internships, etc.) versus me who has just written my \"Hello World\" program when I got in the program.\n\nThat also means that I did not have much time to implement any personal project that is closely related to my interest (data science), and the projects that I have done are class-related (security, scraping data, etc.). My full-time work experience is in researching with different department professors (finance, accounting, economics, etc.).\n\nI am confident in my knowledge of stats (this is what I have worked with while doing research), machine learning, and probably algorithms. I will even graduate with a 4.0 GPA - but still, I feel like, without any internship or projects, I am most likely bringing a rusty knife to a gunfight.\n\nWhat advice would you folks have for me?",

        "body": "A bit of background info: I have been in my current organization for 10 years now and have held mid to senior positions. It has been good 10 years and I got to learn a lot, however lately I\u2019ve started to feel like I need a change due to many reasons most important of which is needing a new perspective and challenges.\n\nIn these 10 years I have not interviewed with anyone, so as you all can imagine, I am out of touch with how to approach the overall interview process. I got one offer a few weeks ago, which I declined since I was not fully ready to switch right away. I have a few more interviews lined up and things are going well so far. My questions are these and if you can offer some advice on it will be appreciated:\n\n1) How much time can you reasonably ask for before you reply to an offer? Since I am going to be interviewing at a few places, I would like to wait for some progress before accepting or declining one. Is the expectation to answer in a day or two?\n\n2) What reason do you give to a recruiter for asking more time? Can I just be honest and tell them I would like to wait to see how my other interviews go?\n\n3) Once I accept an offer, will it be too bad to decline it after? Does this happen often?\n\n4) I would like to take a vacation before I resign in my current organization. I have too many days accumulated. Is it reasonable to ask for joining in 4-5 weeks (3 weeks off plus 2 weeks notice)\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post. I apologize for poor formatting, I am posting from my phone.",

        "title": "How to advance my career in terms of salary in Europe.",
        "body": "I realize this thread, and most of reddit, is US centric but I'm hoping there are some kind, wise sages browsing this sub reddit from Europe or that at least the advice of the kind, wise US sages also applies to Europe.\u00a0\n\nGiven this crazy 2 years I am grateful to even have a job but I find myself seeming to be a bit stuck in my career and I am hoping to get some advice about how I should move forward from people with more experience. I have a bachelor's degree in Software Development (4 years full time) and about 4.5 years of experiences between 3 companies (1 was 5 months internship).\n\nDuring the last 2.5 years of my career, my salary has actually stayed flat and then decreased slightly and is now hovering just ever so slightly above the median average of the country I am in (Netherlands).\n\nI dont see a future with me sticking with the same company who only increase the salary by 2.4% every 15 months. To be honest, the only reason I want a higher salary is to be able to afford a home. If I already had one, I would be more interested in quality-of-life aspects but alas.\n\nThe current average salary that I am on enables me to either rent in a single room apartment/studio with little savings building up (if im even lucky enough to find such a place to rent) or to live in a house share, saving for at least 50% of a house as the max mortgage i could get wouldn't even cover 50% of the average house price. At this rate it would take me 22 years of living in a house share until I have enough to buy a house at the prices of writing this in 2021.\n\nAnd so, I find myself wondering how it is possible to better position oneself and increase one's salary as a software engineer/develop in the Netherlands?\n\nI had 2 ideas so far Im hoping to get some feedback on.\n\n**Idea 1: Get a master's degree in something that will pay well (Data science, Security, computer science, AI/ML).**\n\nNow I realize this idea isn't as simple as, do master's degree -> salary goes up 30%. As I understand it, doing a master's degree in anything other than computer science/software development will be going down a specialization path which means that the general software jobs are no longer really open to me.\n\nIts possible my salary would go up a good bit but the number of jobs I can apply for will be fewer. In addition, there is a risk involved as to do a full time 2-year course I would need to apply and win a grant, quit my job, spend another 2 years in education and afterwards deal with having to apply to compatible positions after graduation until I get lucky enough to find something, not to mention that the landscape could drastically change in 2 years (feeling the effects of covid recession for example).\n\nDoing something general like computer science/software development might increase the job opportunities even more than doing a specialization, as in opening up higher paid developer jobs that have higher standards/requirements but im not sure how big the pay raise would be, its possible that its not even worth it.\n\nIm not sure about this idea, it may be possible to do a part time masters and still keep my current job as a safety net but it\u00a0doesnt look very realistic.\n\n**Idea 2: Become a Fintech developer.**\n\nDoing a bit of looking around, I noticed how much higher the salaries are for fintech developers, about more than double of what im on. It could be feasible to research what it takes and what it requires to get a role in one of these highly paid positions. I would imagen its incredibly difficult and maybe I do not have enough IQ for it.\n\nI would also imagen its very competitive and there would be many seniors who would want these positions but maybe if I take the time to study/education and make contacts and do some side projects/learning it could be possible to eventually break into this field. Anyone with experience of getting into fintech?\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSo right now, these are the only ideas that I have and im not 100% sure how realistic/feasible they are. Maybe someone has more ideas about what I could do?\n\nIf im just going to be stuck on the national average all my life then I don't really see the point of continuing. Id rather become an English teaching Buddhist monk in Thailand than be a 50-year-old house sharer who rented all his life, put off having a family and now is responsible for taking care of his aging parents.\n\nThank you for reading this and potentially giving some advice. I could really use some guidance from people with more experience.",

        "title": "Reality Check: Please ensure Software Engineering is what you REALLY want to do",
        "body": "A lot of people here will meme about SWE being just \"oh it's copy and pasting code\" off stackoverflow, github, or \"I literally don't do anything most of my day, it's boring\"  but the true reality is doing this shit will get you stressed to the ends of your of wits if you don't actually have an understanding of what you're doing to an extent. This is perhaps the #1 job where people realize the job is NOT worth the pay anymore due to how hard it is (for those that are chasing solely for the money but figure on later out that they can't actually do the job). SWEs are paid good money for a reason. If you can do the job well but hate your job, then that's a different problem that doesn't regard to my point. People who underperform *consistently* in the private industry do get disciplined, and that's not just due to a 'toxic' environment. It's a competitive industry overall.\n\nYou really need to know and understand what the errors are that you're running into and how to fix this. And yes, you do need to know how to code, more than just those 100 line programs you make during college. I'm saying this because I've known many people who go through their degree cheating on assignments and exams (especially with online learning), and then during their new grad position when they run into errors they don't know how to fix it they're stumped for hours. When Monday Agile meetings/standups happen and you have nothing to screenshare, yea you're actually fucked.\n\nI'm not trying to scare people from pursuing SWE, but just know that it's a lot different from college, and with the amount of people who dilly their way through it I guarantee you will get smoked in industry. Also, this profession is not for everyone and know that is okay. If 100% of people who pursued a CS/SE degree freshman year of college and continued to want to become a SWE, oh boy the job market would be fucked even more lol.\n\nEdit: I say this because 2 people on my team pretty much got fired because they couldn't withstand the workload and meet the sprint expectations. It was pretty obvious with the amount of help they asked and no deliverable code present, and note, this wasn't just a one time thing. They were hired for roughly 8 months or so and they were NOT new grads; I know junior engineers aren't expected to know everything and that's understandable, but these people were NOT junior and didn't even know how to do things that were basic in the job requirements. I don't know how tf they got through HR. I understand HR doesn't disclose why a person gets fired, but trust me, you didn't have to ask. It was very, very obvious.\n\nMy main message is to just understand what you're getting into in this industry before you make a career mistake. If you're consistently putting in a lot of effort and cannot meet the deliverables of the company, then maybe this profession isn't for you (it's a hard truth, but it's reality). However, if you are able to bypass the imposter syndrome, great continue on. This post is for those who think they can fluff their resume and interviews with stuff they didn't actually do then get screwed when they get hired. When deadlines hit and they can't report any working deliverable to their boss because they're stuck not knowing how to do something, that's really gets some of these people anxious. Kind of the \"Shit I didn't think I'd get this far\" type of thing. Coding didn't really fit me, and it was honestly too stressful for me to pursue so I went more towards a SRE role.\n\nA lot of people think I'm trying to come off as gate keeping them away from SWE, but I'm doing the complete opposite: trying to re-evaluate if you think you can really do this career and warn you of what's ahead. I came from imposter syndrome too, but when I figured that I was spending 5x longer to fix a bug or error that my co-worker could fix in just an hour, that's really what got me anxious and stressed out. I couldn't keep up to speed with the projects and team so I personally left to a different team. It just wasn't for me and I at that point I realized yea, it's time to move on.\n\nI'm trying to prevent those who are consistently failing now and running in the same circles to just throw in the towel and stop the sunk cost fallacy before you damage yourself further. This is different from being stuck a bug and trying to google what's wrong. *It's wrong to motivate and support someone in doing something that isn't for them, especially when they know that* (that's how I see it). *You'll lead them to failure in the end*. However, if you're progressing, learning, and able to complete your work's responsibilities, then this post doesn't apply to you <3.\n\nLastly, don't bullshit your resume with skills you don't actually know. We find out one way or another.",

I got super invested in this field and really grew a lot of love for it. Then coronavirus hit and I was laid off (as I lost my student rights after graduating). For months I looked for job and recently got job as brand manager, but I can already see that I don't see myself in that type of job, and I would rather be business data analyst or something in those lines than what I do now.\n\nI was just about to start using our databases (on that project) but sadly I was introduced to mere basics and haven\u2019t learned much more as I was laid off. I always had techie side to me, which is why I was called to do this job in first place, and data science is something that really sparks my interest and I genuinely want to learn and do something in that field (if possible).\n\nMy question is, is it possible for someone who like me never studied formally Computer Science learn some of those skill and programming and programming languages, and turn them into career or is it too late? I was thinking to start with learning basics on my own (I got advice to start with Python or SQL), and then maybe when I need to advance those basics to take a course or something. Is this good start?\n\nAt work we use program (ERP) that is based on SQL and I guess all of our data is saved on Microsoft SQL server (I still haven\u2019t been able to get this information as most of my coworkers are only basic computer users \u2013 they don\u2019t even know how to open console on chrome), so I assume that if I actually knew SQL and how to work in databases I could implement that in my work.\n\nBasically I\u2019m looking for any advice I can get. Thanks in advance!  \n\n\nEDIT: Also if it is possible I would like some advice if it is possible to do it on your own (mostly) and how to do it? There are tons of free courses and I wonder if they are good start?",

It felt pretty good to start, but this didn't last too long.\n\nAs the boss\u2019 ambitions grew he needed me to code more and more, working on chat bots for a phone app, and things definitely outside my comfort but still things I enjoyed. It was fun to learn and see the learning take shape! As things went on though he began to start getting verbally abusive. I would be yelled at for not having some work done when I hadn't been given deadlines, I would be forced to rush code to make demo days, which meant bad code that later needed fixing but the boss would berate me for the quality and then be frustrated when the team said we need to fix it. \n\nAfter 8 months we brought in a very smart programmer who mentored me a bit but noticed my boss would single me out. He would ask what history I had with him to warrant his constant frustration to which I explained I didn't. I just sort of became the guy to point out because I was the weakest link. Mind you I tried really hard to keep improving, but my fiance was very ill and I had to take care of her as well.\n\nAfter a year the company went under and I was offered to keep working without promise of lay which I refused. It's been 2 years since then and a part of me really wants to get back into it...but I feel like I have this, crazy potent hesitancy the moment in about to start. Like I freeze up and panic or something, and then I go back to doing something else, sometimes nothing else.\n\nHave any of you had an experience like this and found a way to find that passion again? I find myself wanting to feel that spark of learning something and seeing it develop before me, but I constantly choke now and I just don't know where to even begin anymore.\n\nThanks for even just reading this it's been a while but I haven't spoken to many people about it, it just helps to even type it out lol",

        "body": "Hey all,\n\nSo i've worked at a very small agency for the last four years as their only full time developer. I've primarily worked with Wordpress and React applications, working with Laravel on the backend. I am comfortable on the backend, especially with Node and PHP, but primarily am interested in a front end role as I find FE more enjoyable and feel much more proficient with it. My experience with React consists of mostly working on a single application from our client for the last 2 years, multiple platforms, payment processing, authentication etc. \n\nI've become a bit unhappy with my current position, both with the pay and the quality of work we are outputting (being a sole developer with basically only help from my boss who is acting as project manager, I often feel we aren't doing things right or efficiently). So I have recently been applying and looking for other opportunities, preferably working on a product rather than hopping between client projects like I'm currently doing with my current company.\n\nOver last three weeks, I've been interviewing with a company for a senior frontend position that has their offices local to me. Publicly traded company, very well known, revenue increasing exponentially, with what seems to be a very large and cohesive engineer team. Furthermore, the salary range that I've been given for the position from the company recruiter is almost TRIPLE my current salary im earning. \n\nI've just finished my 4th interview with them, and have killed all the interviews thus far.. Their stack is identical to what I've been building for our client for the last 2 years, and using technologies that I genuinely enjoy using like React + CSS Modules. They also are very happy about my previous agency experience as they are looking for developers who are able to context-switch easily. Im moving on to what seems to be my last set of interviews next week with some stakeholders and the president of the company, and although im still not betting on anything, it seems that Im closing in at receiving an offer from the company for the position.\n\nFor each stage of the interview, I have looked up the interviewer and their experience. Most if not all of the interviewers have at least a year or two more experience than me, and have worked for various different companies as i really only have experience at a single agency. For me, I have experience with the processes of a single company and am worried I dont have the leadership and decision making skills that someone who has worked with a larger variety of React applications would have. \n\nI do have bad bouts of imposter syndrome, but I also consider myself cognizant enough to realize when I am out of my wheel house or when Im capable of something. \n\nIs it normal for someone transitioning from a mid-level role to a senior role to feel this way? If I seem like Im able to confidently answer the algorithm, design, and decision-making questions that are asked in the interview about their current technologies, should this be enough to ease myself that Im what they are looking?\n\nI apologize ahead of time if the post is a bit sporadic; having a hard time putting what im feeling into words. Just looking for advice from someone who has possibly transitioned from a mid-level to a senior-level role and what to expect compared to a lower-experience position.",

        "body": "TLDR// I plan on getting an IT certification at a vocational school before pursuing a bachelor's in comp sci. I'll be making more money in IT than I would be working at McDonald's, so putting myself through college will be less of a strain. I'll also come out of University with 4 years of work experience in the tech field.\n\nPlease bear with me as this is my first post. I'm a senior in high school approaching graduation and have already been accepted to a reputable four-year institution, but am not ready for the financial strain that comes with being a student. I'll be graduating with roughly a 2.7/ GPA (unweighted), and a 32 composite score on the ACT. I was discouraged from looking into scholarship opportunities, due to my low GPA (a huge mistake on my part). I come from a low-income family, and thus am not receiving much aid (other than FAFSA). I plan on attending a vocational school for one year to receive a skills certificate in IT. For the tech nerds like myself that are interested in specifics, the course is CompTia based and seems well rounded. It provides students with insight into Network+, A+, Linux+, Cloud+, and Security+. It's is a year-long, costs roughly four thousand dollars and totals out to be 900 hours worth of schooling. After finishing the course, I plan on pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science, or Computer Engineering (something of the sort). Ideally, I would be working part-time throughout college in IT to support myself financially. Working in IT, as opposed to a minimum wage job, would allow me to work fewer hours to get paid roughly the same. Additionally, by the end of my college career, I'll have racked up four years of work experience in the tech field, consequently making me more valuable to future employers.\n\nSidenote// If anyone has any suggestions that pertain to finding scholarships after having graduated high school, or alternative plans please let me know!",

In short, I'm looking to take a coding bootcamp and am having a tough time making a choice. I'm based outside of Toronto, and I've looked at bootcamps within the area, but ultimately I've come down to two BrainStation and General Assembly.\n\nA little background about me, I went to university for Electrical Engineering and have worked as a Project Engineer and Design Engineer since graduating in 2017. For the past few months I've been self-teaching Python and AI (HarvardX AI cert on EdX and a few others on Coursera), but have been looking to move towards Full-Stack. The reason I'm looking into a bootcamp is to better structure my curriculum to be more regimented as I've been mainly exploring the different avenues I could pursue in programming. \n\nBrainstation covers HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React/Node.js/MySQL (from what I've heard, mostly focused on the front end).\n\nGeneral Assembly covers HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React/Node.js/MongoDB/Python/Django/PostgresSQL (also from what I've heard, more back-end oriented).\n\nI'm looking to get some insight as to whether one bootcamp's stack would better prepare me for the continued self-teaching I'll have to do after the bootcamp. i.e. Would it be better to focus more on front-end with BrainStation as they're heavier in the JS domain? Or would it be better to focus more on the back-end with General Assembly and have a broader familiarization?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

I'm intrigued by the fact that they primarily use OCaml for the sake of code clarity and from what I know the culture seems pretty good. I do also know, however, that it's notoriously hard to get into. I'd like to know if anyone has any insight on how to maximize chances of getting in like what to put on my resume, what things to study and practice before the interview, etc.\n\nA bit about me, I'm a math major with a CS minor with 3.7 GPA from an alright-to-decent school. My work experience consists of one data science internship where I didn't do much and I currently work at Amazon and approaching the 4 year mark so I want to switch to something else once I get all my stocks. I don't really have any side projects and wouldn't call myself a super good programmer, I am only particularly comfortable in Java and Python and don't know many software engineering tools other than tools internal to Amazon. To be honest I think I lucked out on my Amazon interview because my raw programming skill is kind of weak. However I am decently good at puzzles/riddles and so I think I can understand complicated algorithms conceptually but I would need to practice a lot to be able to code them out. I never did competitive programming or anything like that but I did well in advanced algorithms courses which were based on pseudo code and proofs and diagrams. Also, as a math major, I found big O to be pretty easy compared to the kinds of math I did in my program. I don't think I would have any trouble analyzing the run time of programs and finding places where there could be optimizations.\n\nI'd be super interested in knowing what my chances of making it to the interview are and if anyone has any ideas for things I should practice or improve on to maximize my chance of getting in. I heard that Jane Street doesn't usually interview people who failed an interview with them before and so I'd like to get it right the first time. And while I went to a pretty good school I don't think it's a target school so that also hurts my chances, and I'm not sure what their GPA cutoff is or if there even is one. But I think my math background could be appealing to them. Any advice would be super appreciated, thanks!",

I've been considering a switch to tech and am working through CS50 and then want to move onto other certifications for Linux, Networking, Systems Admin, etc. Almost every entry-level job that I'm finding is negotiable on degree and certificates, but usually requires at least 1-2 years of experience in IT settings.

I am working on features for a new financial application that will be released in the coming months. However, my onboarding has been a shitshow but it's slowly getting better... I am not sure the team knew that I was joining LOL I would say this financial company would be considered the top bank/investment institution in the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe team at the tech company is a customer data backend-focused team. Not the most exciting team but I got the chance to actually meet the team and the hiring manager during the interviews.  The company is a not FAANG tier, but it is a company most people have heard about before and is a company you would find in Silicon Valley. The culture and team seem awesome and seem like an awesome place to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo basically if I were to leave my current company, I would be blacklisted by the financial world possibly... my question is what is best for my career? (Salary, Learning, Career Progress, etc...) My goal is to learn as much as a developer as possible to eventually start my own startup and to earn as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould greatly appreciate any advice or opinions from you guys!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

My first job was a contract job that ended because the contract ended and they didn't renew due to the company having some internal issues. I ended up leaving my next job due to wanting to work in a different technology stack. The next place I worked put me in a position where they cut my pay massively hoping I would quit so they didn't have to pay me unemployment due to me underperforming in my position and I just got let go from my job yesterday where they claimed \"the company was going in a different direction\" and they wanted more senior level developers on the team. I assume that's true, but I still get the impression they thought I might have been underperforming based on other parts of that conversation. \n\nI'm job hunting now and am trying to figure out what I should be looking for in order to work at a place long term and grow as a developer in order to fill in any possibile gaps in knowledge I have so I can improve. I'm sticking to postings that specifically say entry level or junior to be on the safe side. I have a lot of experience mainly with web technologies like html/css/JavaScript and PHP/MySQL. I just spent the last year and 8 months using codeigniter at my last job and got really familiar with it, but it seems like a lot of companies are moving away from these types of frameworks and  stacks in favor of AWS services and js frameworks. I have some exposure to AWS (completed an associate solutions architect course, but haven't passed the exam yet) and have been learning Vue but don't have any production experience with it and a lot of companies are looking for 2+ years even in junior positions. I assume this is a fairly common situation to be in in, how have others death with this and how have you found your groove?",

I got a job at a healthcare company writing SQL and SSRS reports. 3 years later I got promoted to a new position working with MS Dynamics. \n\nThe company and culture, while corporate and corny at times, is anything but toxic. I feel valued and rewarded for my hard work. Management is supportive and it\u2019s a very collaborative atmosphere. Office politics exist I\u2019m sure but I don\u2019t have to worry about them. PTO is generous and so is the pay. \n\nBut I just can\u2019t focus. I\u2019m just not interested in any of this shit. It was the same with both the SQL and dynamics positions, which as tools are both fine and kind of fun to work with, but in the context of healthcare and the corporate world I just really have trouble staying on top of all the meetings, different projects, terminology, processes, ect. I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed. I swear to god sometimes a meeting will just land on my calander with zero context and people will talk to me as if I\u2019m an expert in whatever it is they\u2019re talking about but I literally have no clue. Sometimes I ask for context beforehand and it\u2019s just more shit I don\u2019t understand. I feel like I\u2019m low IQ and just managed to charm my way into this job.\n\nI have no idea what the hell is going on most of the time and I just kind of stumble my way through everything until it\u2019s \u201cdone\u201d and either deployed or forgotten about for 3 months until it randomly comes up again. I the meantime 6 other things will be piled onto my plate. Sometimes I finish shit without understanding what I did or what it\u2019s for.\n\nMy honest feelings are that I don\u2019t give a shit about my job. I just want to develop my games but I\u2019m not naive, I know putting it all on the line in the hopes my little indie game will take off is a dumb move... I just can\u2019t stand the office life. I feel like I\u2019m so stressed out for no reason. I exercise regularly and whatnot but I feel like my body is in worse shape than when I was landscaping lol\n\nPart of me wants to go back to blue collar life and just make my games on the side, but I would need to pick up an actual trade to support the house and kids. \n\nIdk how bad did I fuck up here in going down this path?",

        "body": "I've been working in one of big companies developing custom OS for several years. My activities included developing userspace services, custom libc and some S/W parts of the proprietary kernel. This was a job I really liked; the only reason I left it was a lack of understanding how tech processes should work. For several years, me and many my colleagues tried to change the situation, with little to no success; when most of talented colleagues left, I felt that the project stagnates, and also took an uneasy decision to leave.\n\nAnyway, even after some months passed, I feel that I really miss what I did there. I really liked the job, only political questions or absurd management made it less attractive. I would really like to find some project which is concentrated around the stuff I used to do. I'm particularly interested in concepts like capabilities, TCB, object-oriented; OSes and frameworks which attract me most include Fuchsia, Capsicum, Windows (not API-wise, though) and similar. I mostly dealt with C over these years; my C++ skills are rusty. Anyway, language is not a problem, I can learn new languages as well; I simply prefer C.\n\nAn ideal project would be:\n\n* An operating system which is aware of Orange Book and TCB, and tries to follow these principles to at least some extent.\n* Mostly userspace activities, like libc development, implementing miscellaneous services, perhaps even RPC to some degree.\n* It'd be perfect if I could operate on kernel/userspace boundaries, e.g. implementing new system calls or other kernel<=>userspace interfaces.\n* Preferably the significant part is written in C, which I know much better than anything else; other languages are not a problem, the C is simply the favorite one.\n* The project has some space for an architect.\n* The job is remote.\n\nOf course, I realize that it's rather difficult to meet all these criteria; I mostly shown them for an illustration of what I like and prefer. I tried investigating many jobs available, but, given somewhat narrowed scope, it's difficult to find something. Most vacancies for C developer I checked deal with either firmware or hardware; whilst I'd really like to become proficient in these areas as well, I'd like to at least start with fields where I feel myself already proficient enough. That said, I'm OK to use languages other than C, and participate in projects which deal with other userspace parts; above is an ideal image of the world, I realize it's close to impossible to find something that specific.\n\nI'm struggling to find something which matches my interests, and would be glad for any tip. Finding a job which matches these criteria via search engines is difficult, if not impossible, but perhaps real people can give me an advice?\n\nUPD: I also should mention that quite a lot of my activities recently concerned taking architectural solutions, publishing designs on implementations and similar actions.",

The CTO walked me out and told me she sincerely enjoyed the interview.\n\nFast forward to today where I am moving on to the second step of the interview process (out of 2 or 3 steps) with the company I have wanted to work with this entire time. They are one of the best companies to work for in the entire state. Not only that, but I am interviewing for two different jobs with this company.\n\nThe issue is that the small company said they move fast and will let me know mid next week if I get the job, and while I cannot be totally sure they will send me an offer, I do feel very good about it. At the same time, the bigger company I am interviewing with can move a little bit slower. I do not want to reject the small offer just in hopes that the larger company sends an offer. What is the best way to handle this situation?\n\nShould I inform the large company at the end of the interview that I am expecting an offer from the small company sometime next week? And that I would rather work for them, but do not want to screw up my chances with the smaller company? Do I let the small company know that I am waiting on results from the large company?\n\nI do not want to piss either off and have them send rejections. They are both great opportunities.

My Chinese is getting a bit rusty so I might have missed a few details, but this seems to be what happened: \n\nThere's this intern from Peking University who worked Jan - Apr and told her leader that she wants to leave in April because they're busy with graduating. The leader said no because she didn't find a replacement for her position and told her to keep working. After May 1st, a junior of the leader's joined the team, so OP wrote a 10,000 character transitional document and asked to quit on May 11th again, but the leader said that OP still couldn't leave because the backup wasn't found by the OP. On top of that, the leader said to OP that their working skills are really bad and they have to find two backups (replacements) to fill the holes in her work and questioned OP why they couldn't find a replacement when everyone else could. \n\nOP's post then goes into detail about legality (no mention of needing to find a replacement before leaving), violence at the workplace (OP's roommate's leader told the roommate that \"leaving without finding a replacement is irresponsible\", and when OP brought this issue to HR, HR said that OP was arguing about semantics / denying that the leader had said such a thing), why they needed two backups (was she doing two people's work?), and double standards (a roommate of hers didn't need to find a backup to leave, so why would she need to?). \n\nHope we can have a discussion about this here.\n\nEDIT: Sorry about using \"she\" in the title.

I was applying during peak COVID so I took the first decent job I found. The work is ok for me (I like designing APIs), the people are great, the work-life balance is impeccable but for my experience and skillset, I'm being grossly underpaid ($72k/y +8k bonus) (HCOL).\n\n I don't think there is much room for working on newer projects at my current company (cut and dry, develop this feature, fix this bug, etc).  I very much want to leave for a company that will pay me more, and allow me to work with engineers that I can learn from. The only redeeming quality about this company is that I only have to work like \\~15h a week MAX. No micromanaging.\n\nI know that I'm being underpaid, so I've been grinding LC for the past 3 months and I'm making steady progress. I've been taking all the SWE interviews I can get just for the practice and recently I've been offered a glorified Sales Engineer job. The comp is \\~120K + 15-20k bonuses. This is basically 50K more than I make now. The role doesn't sound very appealing, but from what I can gather they want someone to come to develop tools and scripts to automate their demo environment (so there would be some SWE). \n\nRegardless, I would still keep grinding LC if I took this job because I don't want to end up in the sales engineering world. **Will taking this job hurt my ability to pivot back to a pure SWE role?**  Would you give up insane WLB + vacation days for 50K for a temporary role as a sales engineer?\n\nRight now I'm still confused. An extra (50k / y) would be extremely great, I just don't want to hurt my ability to get back into an SWE role... \n\nAlso, this company I'm currently at is working at knows I want a raise, and I've been vocal about it but I'm met with nothing but lip service.\n\nTLDR: \n\noption A: stay at current company, maybe get a 10-15k raise within the year, continue to work on CRUD APIs but not work with newer tech stacks / develop my skills that much.\n\noption B: go to company B, make $50k more at least, and do something I also don't particularly enjoy, that moves outside of the SWE world, and continue to study.",

This includes enabling feature flags and manual testing for things that we cannot automate.\n\n10% \u2014 Meetings.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how normal this is for a junior, but I suspect it is not normal at all.\n\nI have discussed the issue with my manager multiple times. He pays lip service to correcting the imbalance but I feel that I am stuck in an endless cycle of activities that are not enriching my skill-set as a developer. I have some interesting projects lined up but they require many hours of investigation and proposals before I\u2019ll touch any code.\n\nMy biggest concern is that my experience looks good on paper but, in reality, is lacking. Future employers may expect more from me than I am capable of delivering, given my sub-par experience at my current job.\n\nI am not sure how long I will stay with this company; I am in my 30s and want something more laid back and without so much on-call. However, I worry about leaving my first job too soon and how this may be perceived by future employers.\n\nIs this what modern software development is like at big companies? Am I doing something wrong? Is there anything I can do to improve my situation?\n\nAny feedback is very much appreciated.\n\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone who has replied so far. The responses have helped me to shift my perspective and view my experience more positively.",

        "body": "Hello guys, I guess I also have some additional questions too. \n\nSo I have been working at this financial firm as a contractor the past 2 years (first job) and recently they have extended me an offer to become a full time employee. \n\nWe had been using waterfall so basically we would have a bundle every 3 months, I got used to that and it worked fine, that gave me a lot of time to research and be able to code everything before the deadline comes up. \n\nA month ago we switched to agile, we have two weeks sprints now, and also I have switched to another team so the projects are all kinds new to me. \n\nI'm just feeling a bit overwhelmed and starting to feel \"guilty\" for not being fast enough, we have many meetings during the week and while I communicate fine and I'm very professional I feel bad that my whole team are way smarter than me, granted I am the only junior Dev and they are all seniors, but I feel like overall I'm slow and like 10 mins in during a technical meeting I get pretty lost, while the rest of the team keep talking very technical until the meeting is done, it doesn't help that I have ADHD too lol but I am taking meds and they are helping a bit. \n\nI would say overall, I have not received any negative feedback from either my managers or my colleagues, in fact both of them recommended me and spoke great things about me, but I have this crippling feeling that I just keep getting \"lucky\" and I will very soon be \"exposed\" and then crash and burn. \n\nAnd ever since I started working from home last year this feeling had been getting worse, I always feel like I'm deceiving everyone around me and I'm not smart or good as they think I am. I guess this is all caused by years of being in the engineering school and building the imposter syndrome, and having to be like that for all those job interviews. \n\nI also think ever since I started working from home I keep having the urge to log in to my work laptop again after work hours, I really don't feel \"done\" for the day if that makes sense. \n\nAnyone dealt with those issues before? And how did you overcome them? \n\nThanks !",

I've only been there for 2 months and a little before that they hired a new CEO. The new CEO is highly unpopular from what I gather and is a very old school \"ass in seats\" type of guy. I kept seeing emails about the new \"DC office\" and how they were targeting that area.\n\nThe listings for their jobs that were remote shrank significantly and they are all targeted towards Washington, DC now. I didn't think much of this until I started seeing engineer after engineer leave. 4 people from my small team left in a month along with other big time departures like the president of the company. It was very hush hush as to why  they departed and they all \"left on good terms\". \n\nSo then I see some Glassdoor reviews pop up, and they keep saying the same thing: the new CEO wants people to move and work out of DC and that's why people are leaving. Well, I live in Phoenix so there is no fucking way I'm going to move my entire family to DC out of the blue. \n\nMy manager hasn't said a thing about this to me, but I keep getting emails talking about DC and people leaving. So at this point it's just a rumor, but seems to have some substance behind it. \n\nIf this does happen it will count as a lay off right? I am hesitant about looking for a new job right now because I don't want a 2-4 month stint on my resume and then having to explain why.

        "body": "Hello,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I have made some mistakes in my career, luckily I think they have been early enough is isn't to late to try and salvage the situation. I am curious to hear everyone's take on what is going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was working at a fairly large military contractor for last part of my schooling, and worked full time for a year (graduated in April). So started in Jan of last year and left in Feb. This job was great actually really enjoyed it, there was those days where I hated it but for the most part everyone was super collaborative, interesting work, modern stack, and not much to complain about. Then they started doing restructuring they ended up selling my team   to another company, got put on a new team, then that new team started getting dissolved, and I basically was unsure about my job and what was really going on. In addition to every thing that was going on after talking to other friends I realized I was getting pretty underpaid compared to market value for the area, I was getting paid 72k, and most places were 80-90.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now, I took a new job that is fully remote (it's local but they gave me the option to work remote), the job paying a lot better $110, which honestly probably is way to much, but hey they offered it.  However that is where this drama just barely starts. So this job has a TON of technical debt, more so then what they originally told me.  They have a backlog of almost a year plus worth of bugs, angular 8, and what not.  With this technical debt there are lot of bugs (I would say 70% of backlog items), many of which aren't even fixable with current stack, or super hard to trouble shoot.   \n\n\nAs we fix issues there is no current process to really test against production environment, and QA testers also are stuck with half testing it. So with that we fix things and it introduces other small things, or maybe it wasn't possibly fixed. Which is fine, but it is difficult cause all of these come back to look like its my fault.. Which our team is really small its me and one other guys (which doesn't do a ton). But lately I feel like everything has been a complete mess, and everyone is playing the blame game, and complaining stuff is not getting done fast enough. Which is the furthest from the truth.

But I  basically am worried that based off past stories I have heard one day I will just go in and they will let me go. (I guess they dont usually hire full time (as I am), looking at the company states 80% of work force is contracted employees) Which this was my worry all along because I know looking like a job hopper is not good. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are plenty of other stuff going on with the company, which honestly is just shady (they've been lying to 3rd parties, and I have to say stuff particular way or they get stuck paying more money). Just to list a few..  I'm worried if I'm let go it basically sets me up for a super bad looking resume and 100% a job hopper.... Feel like it's a touch situation to be in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAppreciate any insights/experiences you may have had.",

        "title": "Wtf is going on with my recruiter???",
        "body": "Hi Redditors, I ran into the strangest situation this week and am looking for some thoughts and advice on what to do.\n\n**TL;DR:** As a contractor, I applied for an internal FTE position for the same role under my current manager that I was basically told I would for sure get. After my interviews and all positive feedback from them, recruiting won't move forward with my application. Could the recruiter have something against me or a vested interest to hire external candidates?\n\nDetails:\n\nI'm currently work as a contractor at a fairly large tech company via a consulting company. There's an opening for a full time position on my team for the same role that I'm working in now. (FYI, it's not SDE but similar.) I joined late last year and am doing well, so my manager (who's also the hiring manager for the position) recommended me to apply. Unfortunately, since it's a bigger company with a lot of rules, there's no simple conversion from contractor to FTE - I have to go through the full interview process. My manager basically told me this would just be a formality and my interviews would mostly be with people on our team whom I already work with.\n\nI finished all the interviews and got positive feedback during all of them. After a week, I asked my manager if there any updates and he said he hasn't heard from recruiting. So I reached out to recruiting asking when I can expect to hear and they said they're still debriefing other candidates and will get back to me when that's done.\n\nThe thing is, it's kind of strange but I was also asked to help out as interviewer for the same position that I am applying to since there are two FTE positions open for this role. Since I'm the only person doing this work right now on the team and whoever else we hire will be working closely with me, my manager wanted me to be an interviewer. So I interviewed a couple other candidates the same week I had my own interview. Recruiting held a debrief session with the interviewers - including me - and the candidates got the decisions within 3 days after their interviews. We didn't hire them. (Btw, I'm not involved as an interviewer anymore, because recruiting found out that I was a contractor and there is some rule that contractors can't be interviewers for FTE positions.)\n\nSo now it's been \\~2 weeks after my own interviews and I still haven't heard anything. I asked my manager about this again today. He said he's asked recruiting several times to move forward with setting up the debrief meeting for me, but that they \"seemed to be ignoring his requests.\" He told me that even though recruiting doesn't have a say in who gets hired, he is dependent on them to coordinate the process.\n\nI wonder why this recruiter assigned to me is refusing to move forward with my application? I haven't talked to them in person outside of a couple email exchanges, all very brief and polite from both sides. Even the initial \"recruiter screen\" and scheduling the interviews were done by other people. So I don't think they have anything against me personally, but perhaps they have a vested interest to hire the candidates that are sourced/introduced by them? Has anyone heard of this happening?\n\nWhat should I do in this situation?? Can this recruiter actually block me from being hired? At this rate, they will continue delaying my application while they continue bringing in new candidates. And I'll be forced to extend my contract after it ends next month (and obviously, not guaranteed that I can continue extending in the future) and miss out on this FTE opening.",

        "body": "Hello, I'm a junior dev at a start up company. I recently started questioning myself whether \"making things work first, then deal with issues later\" is a good mindset or not. From my little experience, I feel like my team tends to create things without deep analysis or designing/architecting and without much consideration on what would potentially come up next. Just get things done first for customer, and deal with the rest later. For e.g. design a db in a way that it leverages the existing code as much as possible to get things done on time. Now a year later, it became a performance bottleneck, and the code is already coupled enough. It has grown a lot and become risky to make big changes. And fixing bugs/issues from it is becoming really stressful for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where my question started. I wonder if this is the best way to deal with the things and if it's really true that we don't need to build \"future\" now. Can you guys share your experience?

I make 55,000 a year (which isn\u2019t easy to manage in Austin) I received no bonus this year. I accepted this job out of desperation. I Also received no training when I started. I had to learn the ropes along the way with no guidance. The benefits are great but my salary just seems really low for the amount of work I put in and also for building a massive chunk of the front end of our project from the ground up. Anyways I wanted to know what others think and if I should either ask for a raise/promotion or move on somewhere else after the 1 yoe mark. Let me know what you guys think and even better if you work or have worked in this area!",

So I'm a new grad who's been applying to places for a while and I've only started the interview process and haven't gotten an offer yet but I just wanted to ask you guys for your opinion. I guess I'll just list out the pros and cons and general thoughts. Also if it matters, I'm in Canada.\n\nSo on one hand, the pay is very very good, especially for a junior swe position without much experience. The only experience I have is doing a bit of freelancing stuff while I was in university. On the other hand, it's only an 8 month or so long position with the possibility of an extension afterwards. This is the main thing that's bothering me because I know that it's basically all about getting that first position and having like 2 years under your belt and it gets easier from there so I was hoping to land a good job for 2 years and try to get into some FAANG type company. With it being a government job, I've also heard it's kind of slow paced and boring but obviously there's various departments and the requirements were pretty new tech (which I've used and am comfortable with) so maybe that won't be the case. I'm also definitely a night owl and was hoping to join a tech company with flexible hours if possible but that's definitely the least of my worries.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty sure I should take the offer if given to me, but I would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThanks!",

        "body": "I'm the lead engineer on a small team at a non-tech company (I refer to my work as \"enterprise software development\"). It's just me and a few juniors. My boss is an architect, kind of. I'll also add that I'm a decent developer, but by no means am I \"FAANG-worthy\".\n\nI've really enjoyed my job up until recently. I've had agency to implement things however I want, and I took that opportunity to make sure we were doing everything in a forward-thinking and well thought-out way, even if that meant taking a few hours/days to try a few things out. By doing this, I learned a lot and even got to build some really neat solutions to problems we encountered while trying to build as smartly as possible.\n\nSome time ago, our CTO decided he wanted our company to be more tech-focused, and chose my boss's team to sort of spear-head this move. Since then, a lot of what we've been developing has been proofs of concept for different business-units, who are used to finding external vendors for technical needs. There was, understandably, considerable push-back to a lot of our work, because change isn't easy--it never is.\n\nThis sort of came to a head a few weeks ago when I was working on a 1-2 week PoC for some business unit (important information: we're a global company, so sometimes there's a language barrier when speaking with other business units). Throughout the development process I kept my boss informed. I told him what I understood the problem to be and how I planned to implement it. I then had him test it out and give me feedback so that I could make it really clean for the inevitable demo to the business unit who asked for it. He was on board... Until the day of the demo. We met (via zoom) to dry-run the demo and he told me, more or less, that in all of his conversations with the requesting business unit he'd never heard them complain about what my PoC aimed to solve, that he wasn't sure the product demo was going to go over well because of that. I was, I think understandably, upset. I asked him why he had approved of me working on this, why I hadn't gotten this feedback earlier, etc. and he just said \"I made a mistake\". Needless to say, the demo went poorly.\n\nThis is one instance, but we've been running into this similar issue (the poor demos, not the miscommunications) for a while and it's got me questioning my role at this company. Aside from this, I've been realizing lately that I have only been learning as much as I have because I chose to. There's not really anyone technical enough around me to give me feedback on my methods or talk through alternative options. Nobody would know if I built stuff in a shitty way, and that *feels* like a yellow, if not red, flag.\n\nThe relationship I have with my boss, which used to be very amicable and relatively close, has been strained by these turns of events, and the stress of work has started to bleed into my not-at-work life (I'm remote, so it's a figurative not-at-work).\n\nFinally, on Monday my boss told me I needed to let a few other folks (who I don't know and have never worked with) have access to our cloud-provider account (like, give them permission to create resources & all that). I asked him what sort of governance we were putting in place to make sure that nothing got out of hand, because it's my role to monitor our cloud-resources and when something's fishy, security comes after me, not him. He said, basically, that we can trust these folks, they're superior to me, etc. and that if security hassled me, I should just refer them to him instead. This feels messy and like it's just asking to be a pain in my neck long term.\n\nIs it time to start polishing my resume? Am I over-reacting? If I leave, it's just a bunch of juniors and an architect, and nobody really knows what we have other than myself (I keep our documentation available to everyone, but that doesn't mean they use it). The juniors would have no mentor and the architect hasn't written code in I don't know how long. I'm not, like, emotionally invested in the success of my employer, so leaving wouldn't really bother me, but I'm sort of at the point in my life where I'd like a \"career position\" so I wouldn't have to shop around for raises & whatnot every few years as is the norm in the tech world.

        "body": "I know this question/topic has been brought up multiple times on this sub, but I wanted to ask it again in the context of my personal experience. I'm currently going into my senior year at a top 10 university (top 10 overall, not necessarily for CS), and I'm studying CS and EE. After a few business/consulting-focused internships, I'm looking to go into tech as I feel it would be a waste not to apply my technical background, and I really am interested in the industry. I have some solid programming skills and projects (mostly from CS classes I've taken), so I think I would fair well as a SWE if I work hard enough, but I don't ever see myself being the \"best\" SWE, or even among the top 5-10% of developers. Thus, I am already planning on going into SWE for a few years, then transitioning into something else, like PM. \n\nI also know that PM roles are extremely hard to come by, and the best time to snag one would be right after graduation. I think I would enjoy a PM role and my skill set is more aligned for PM, but I am concerned about getting into a leadership-type role in tech straight out of college. Again, I will have a CS degree from a great school and have some decent programming experience, but I'm certainly not the best programmer around or someone who codes for fun in their free time. Thus, it seems like I would be out of place starting off as a PM right away and being tasked with leading a team of engineers who are much more skilled than me. \n\nI feel like if I start out in SWE and gain some legitimate technical experience, then I would be a far more effective leader and PM, but on the flip side, getting a role in PM after working in SWE is harder than getting one right out of college. Am I misconstruing what a PM really does or overestimating the technical ability required? I've always felt that my leadership style is most effective when I am as knowledgeable about a task as the people I am working with, but perhaps that is not how I should be looking at PM roles. If anyone has any advice on the decision between going into PM right after college vs transitioning into it after a few years of development experience, I would love to hear your thoughts. It's all really just a big bag of imposter syndrome, but I wouldn't want to start out in a career that I'm not yet suited for.",

I landed a huge account that wants to do a minimum of 80hrs a week, which is awesome, but I also don't have the capacity to do this.

Ideally, I'd like to find someone with ambition and would be willing to take the $110 + some equity to make it worth wild, but I don't even know if that would be enough.\n\nI guess my question is for the senior devs out there, what would it take for you to work for a small software company?  \n\nThanks for reading",

I had around 100 application out at the time just shotgunning for an entry level job, and got 2 responses back both negative. Everyone dropped their summer programs, like half of my college friends were fired from their internships before the first day. For a few months I bounced between doing resume stuffer projects and sending out applications. I was approaching around 200 applications total when I finally got a response from some IT contract position at the local school system. This was really sub-optimal but at this point I was desperate and was willing to work anywhere as long as it was with a computer. It was a good temporary job but I was really dissatisfied with it since the work was repetitive and really easy, not to mention the poor pay. I started applying more on linked in near the end of the contract, and by some miracle an honest-to-goodness software role wanted an interview with me. The interview was almost devoid of technical questions, was obviously just a means for the contracting agency to steal someone's paycheck, and I was hired within 3 days. The pay was not great but is was enough to where I could pay rent and get by. Fast forward 5 months of working remotely doing interesting but underpaid work and developing my stack, some college buddies recommended I try messaging a recruiter for a growing fintech company in my area. About a month of pestering the recruiter finally got me a interview, and I passed with flying colors. Now I have a full-time career with perfectly acceptable pay for a newish grad with great benefits. \n\nLesson being: life is shitty and unfair but if you keep trying you can get lucky and land a career starter. \n\nProgress overview:\n\n\\- 5/2020 with a BA in CS from UNC-CH\n\n\\- 5/2020-8/2020: no job and on the application/learning grind\n\n\\- 8/2020-11/2020: contract helpdesk job at local school 15/hr\n\n\\- 12/2020-5/2021: low wage contract research dev with the government 22/hr\n\n\\- 5/2021-present: average entry-level software dev job in fintech with average entry-level software job wage for the area 35/hr\n\nKeeping the jobs I have secret for anonymity but feel free to AMA.

I decided to see what I am worth else where.\n\nI was able to get an offer for $100K for another mid level position. I like really like my company, at least more than the one I have the offer from. Both have good vacation, company retreats, paid training, maternity/paternity leave(not worried about this). Both are private companies that are profitable. Also both are fullstack positions.

I like what I work on and the people I work with. Not offering insurance on Day 1 and no 401K seems like a red flag to me on the new company.\n\nHow can I use this offer to negotiate with my current company? I want to seem appreciative but I also want to be paid what I am worth. How do I approach my manager about it even though he has little control over this? His manager has more control, should I just go straight to him or is that wrong to go over his head?\n\nAny advice is appreciated.\n\nTLDR; got an offer from another company with a 20% increase.

I know it's not the most glamorous job, but the pay and benefits were competitive for the area and at the time location was really important to me.\n\nShortly after I started working, someone requested that I transfer into their department with the promises of being able to work on exciting technologies and expand my skill set, in addition to being 100% remote. This obviously appealed to me so I signed on.\n\nThe reality of it was that the team that was being put together failed to sign a single contract. So, I was assigned to a project in the meantime to ensure I was billing hours. That project was a small dumpster fire, and was entirely ETL and SQL work.\n\nAfter a few months it was obvious that the project was not advancing my career. I wasn't learning new languages, new skills, or improving the ones I already had. I was working with legacy \"code\", and the client was not interested in improvements or optimizations. They just wanted the product to work, and pay as little as possible to maintain it. There was no incentive for me to learn how to improve or optimize the work I was doing as a result, and I didn't have the budget to explore those things even if I wanted to. Something to consider is that because of the projects problems I got a ton of experience working directly with clients, managing and deciding on budgets, resolution times ,etc. I did a lot of the work of the PM in this role, as our PM took a backseat on a lot of this work. I consider this to be great experience, even though it was stressful at the time, but I'm not sure how to leverage it when searching for jobs.\n\nA few months ago, my boss left our department despite never fulfilling his promises on the kind of work I'd be a part of. I really feel like this has set me back in a huge way.\n\nRecently I was transferred away from that project onto another project that is entirely SQL work. This is despite the fact that I've been very vocal about my concerns as regarding my career development.\n\nI have a bachelor's in CS and an OCA certification for Java, but it's been nearly two years since I've written real code. What do I need to learn/do to start putting myself in a position that I will be a competitive candidate for a role where I'll get to do what I actually want to do?\n\nMy interest right now is in full stack development, but I'm open to anything that really requires me to think and optimize and improve my work. Problem solving is what I love about this field, so if anyone has any other suggestions I'm all ears.\n\nI love working with backend languages like python, java, and C++, but recently I've been trying my hand at Javascript and found that to be pretty enjoyable too.\n\nI did create a small website using one of the main frameworks years ago, that had a front end/back end that worked and was hosted by a hosting service, so I know I can do it. But it's been so long that I can't quite remember the steps I need to take \n\nI'm currently taking an online course on Javascript (udemy) to try to get a really deep understanding of the language before I try my hand at properly learning a framework. My HTML and CSS skills are terrible (right now, but I'm sure I can improve with some elbow grease).\n\nI am moving closer to a larger city (30 min drive) so hopefully my options for employers will greatly expand once I make the move.\n\nIf anyone has any advice at all, I'd love to hear it. For anyone who made it this far, thanks so so much for taking the time.\n\n\nTL:DR; How do I transition from a primarily SQL based role into literally anything else where I get to write real code.",

Any tips on how I can make that happen? I do have a mechanical engineering degree and some years of experience there, but yeah trying to switch to coding, which so far I like a lot better.\n\nFull background:\n\nI started learning JavaScript basics at the beginning of 2020 to get ready for a coding boot camp, but then the whole pandemic thing happened and I felt less inclined to do the boot camp's remote program. Fortunately, I had a close friend who's a Software Engineer and also had prior experience teaching at a boot camp, and he offered to teach me personally as my mentor. He put together his own curriculum tailored for me based on what he thought would be most beneficial, starting with some cs fundamentals, then more web fundamentals, and then finally putting together an actual web application with React. I spent a lot of time building it under his guidance, really making sure to have a polished final product for my portfolio and resume (you can check it out here if you like: [https://www.rolemate.io](https://www.rolemate.io/jobs))\n\nWith that experience, I was fortunately able to get a Software Engineering internship at a startup, where we're working on the very early stages of an app creating the MVP for a social app. It's been pretty good React experience as well as I've been working on new features with the guidance of the Senior Software Engineer.\n\nAnd of course, I've also been practicing with algorithms (my least favorite part) with an online course and just grinding away on different problems and mock interviews. This part is probably my weakest area and I'm still struggling to get solutions consistently.\n\nAnd that's pretty much where I'm at. I've been sending out a BUNCH of applications but haven't gotten a single response besides the internship. Is there any hope for me with my unconventional background??

I'm not sure what to pick. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* If I went to a university I'd have to take out a loan (if even possible with my credit score). I'm planning on buying a house soon so that will probably drop my score even more. Not sure if that affects getting school loans at all. \n* I suck at math. Are there any CS degrees with less complex math or are they all kinda the same? I will 100% try to apply myself regardless but... yea. \n* What remote-learning schools do people recommend?\n* What bootcamps do people recommend/have had success from? Did you have any prior education before the bootcamp?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that's pretty much it for my questions. Thanks!",

        "body": "I, like a lot of people here, am looking into starting a SWE career.\n\nI'm working on a CS degree concurrent with my job, which is probably mostly aligned with \"SQL developer\" but functionally is \"find literally any way to fix this problem the accounting dept has.\" This could be anything from simple report creation to developing an interface for data entry or automating data extraction from multiple independent sources.\n\nThe problem is, my job and team are not really recognized by IT or the company as a whole as a technical department - practically this means the only coding tool at our disposal is VBA (since it's included with MS Office products), and everything must run on that. After a lot of begging and pleading we only recently got access to a proper DBMS (MSSQL). No standalone software or script can be created outside of the \"real\" IT/dev dept, but their turnaround time on such requests from other depts (like accounting) is abysmal (1-2 years). But the CFO was desperate and so managed to carve out the position I now have with a few other people.\n\nSo back to my original question - I'm aware that VBA is not a \"real\" language (real as in, used seriously for development by a tech company), but I also think it would be disingenuous to say that I haven't learned a lot from having to use it so much for work. Would you consider the 1.5 years I have doing this as relevant xp when applying for a SWE position, or no; and in either case, how would you describe it in an application (ie concise yet attractive)?\n\nEDIT: typos",

Currently I'm working at one of the best companies in my city, meaning I get to work with the best people in this field. I'm pretty good at what I do, at least according to my performance reviews. From the outside, everything about my career seems perfect, I got promoted almost every year, and I get paid really well with stock options.\n\nHowever, lately I've been having my doubts. I don't really consider myself an extremely extrovert person, but whenever I don't meet someone for 24 hours my mood falls down significantly. I love talking to other people, getting to know other people, travelling, and in general I like to be on the move all the time. I just hate being in one place. Even when I was working in an office I used to go to different floors all the time with my laptop to work in different places. If I could I'd rather move to a different country every year.\n\nThe best time of my career was when travel was still allowed and I could travel to different cities within my company to help other teams there. There I could meet new people, talk with them to get to know what their problem was, go for drinks with them after work, and travel. I enjoyed this phase of my career the most!\n\nI'm still trying to figure out what I want from life, but I'm pretty sure if I keep doing what I'm doing I'll go crazy. Don't get me wrong, I love programming and there's a reason why I got into this field, but I can't sit in front of a computer for 8 hours a day without much social interaction. The best part of a day for me is when we have meetings, or when I get to pair-code with someone, or when we finally go for lunch where we talk with each other. As a sidenote, I also used to be a bartender during my high school years and I really liked the way there was always something to do, always some important issue to resolve, etc.\n\nTherefore, I guess my main question is, do you know of any role in this/any other industry where my software engineering skills would be useful while I could also do what I love doing the most: talking to people, working on different projects, and travelling?",

        "body": "Hello, I come with an unusual question / scenario and was looking to get some advice or information from people who are in the field.\n\nI'm 23 and about to graduate with a CS degree and a 3.2 GPA from a decent university. I really like C# and .NET and have several webapps out there that I designed, built and deployed by myself(Including one that makes me a little $$!). I have a decent resume and would consider myself to be a proficient programmer who has enough full stack projects out there to let a potential employer know I'm a good candidate.\n\nI'll skip the pity stories because no one gives a shit, but I didn't have it easy growing up and often turned to trolling and being a piece of shit online for entertainment when I was a teen, it was the best form of attention I could get at the time. I used to bait people on reddit, twitter, and other social medias and say some dumbass shit, I loved the thrill of seeing just how many angry replies I could get and how angry people would get at me. This all took place when I was ages 15-18. \n\nI made the foolish mistake of trusting a good IRL friend of mine with this knowledge of my shit past and about 3 years ago we had a falling out and he doxxed me hard on social media. The logs and things that he posted weren't the most obscene things on this earth, but it did paint me as a very shitty, racist, ignorant person, even though I know for a fact that I never truly believed those things and was just memeing and trolling like an idiot.\n\nI could write for hours about all the things I lost because of it, but I don't want to bore everyone. I lost some old friends and my girlfriend had to disassociate herself with me for good, that one stung the most and still does to this moment.\n\nFast-forward to 3 years later, I've lost a lot of weight, been to therapy and can confidently say that I'm no longer that type of person at all, inside and out. I look back at those years with disgust. The original \"doxxing\" thread is now deleted. The comments on the thread are still there, and when you google my name, one of these comments comes up. It isn't a good look, but it's a lot better than before. I've tried many ways to see if the original doxx thread is archived anywhere but as far as I can tell it isn't (It definitely is somewhere out there, but it looks like it isn't traceable/ easily found)\n\nSo, as I begin to look for a start to my career, I wonder if it's even worth it to press forward, knowing that inevitably someone from HR or a team member or recruiter is gonna google my name and see those two comments labeling me as a piece of shit, It's only a comment or two, so there is a ton of plausible deniability with there being no concrete logs linking to my name. I can't have any social media anymore, as it would most likely just get harassed and to be honest I have no desire to maintain a social media presence at all, is this going to be a problem for your average company? Should I just own up to everything if ever asked? \n\nI'm sorry for writing this cringe, pathetic thread, and I'm sure that many reading this will say that I don't deserve to have a career of any sorts, and I can understand your position if this is the case. This is something that has consumed my life for several years now and has drove me to the brink of suicide and back several times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks",

I didn't have any work experience other than being a volunteer tutor at our school's compsci club and working part time at school as an IT assistant. Most of my projects are from classes that had a semester long deliverable and a senior year capstone project were we worked in a group with PMs and sponsors. The few personal projects that I have is a discord bot, a barebones path algorithm visualizer website, and a few web scraping applications for stocks and covid information. I didn't start applying to jobs till after I graduated (which is a mistake for sure) and I applied throughout the summer using LinkedIn and Indeed. Couple of friends gave me their referrals for companies in my area but never heard back from the company due to the lack of actual work experience, ie. internships/co-ops. I got demotivated from the job hunt in september and was getting anxiety from not hearing back from companies and family members lecturing every other day about not finding oppurtunities. The pandemic also made me demotivated from starting new projects and doing leetcode problems without getting even a phone call from companies made me demoralized. I started only applying to jobs every now and then. Fast forward to now, in the past month I started some online courses on udemy, cs50 from harvard, and freecodecamp to learn more about web dev. Put the things I learned and started working on more personal projects, started applying to 10+ companies a day but still not hearing from anyone. I need advice on whether I should hit up a bootcamp and try to network there, in hopes of landing a job or keep doing what I am doing right now. Another option would be going back to school for my masters. My asian parents have been pushing me to work at a family member's restaurant out of state and saying I should make money instead of sitting at home on the computer. My family is a traditional Chinese family, my parents are first gen immigrants and I feel like I'm a failure and on top of the weekly talks about what I'm doing with my life, where I explain that I'm trying to learn more skills, do more projects to put on resume. My life has been getting pretty toxic and depressed and I don't know what path to take and wanted some opinion on what I should do since it feels like I'm stuck on island.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Graduated last year as a CompSci major, have no internships and co-op, started applying after graduation and throughout the summer, never heard back from any company. Started to get demotivated after spending so much time on applications and doing leetcodes daily. Started to apply in staggered amounts spread throughout the months. Started applying 10+ applications a day this past month and picked up motivation to learn a new language in Javascript and did a few online classes and crash courses on web development. Getting pressure from parents to get a job (even though I am trying and applying every day) and feel so lost on what path I should take. Need some opinions on what I should do.",

I recently stumbled across Free Code Camp and thinking about pursuing their training at least as a hobby, if not as a way to transition into a programming career.  My question: were I to pursue it as a way to transition into a programming career, would I find programming to be just as demanding as IT?  Thanks in advance for your help!",

I need to let off some steam because I have no idea how much of this is my fault or what I can really do to solve it, so maybe I can get your help on what to do at this point.\n\nThe problems began at the start, when the laptop they gave me made it impossible to run basic executables. The solution for that was to mail the laptop back for a replacement, which they only permitted me to do two months in. Then only when I got it back did I have to go on a business trip for another project for two more weeks, and by that point I forgot so much introductory information I was supposed to have remembered from onboarding. After that, I waited another two weeks for the helpdesk to download Node. I should also mention that I cannot download any software, I need to submit a ticket to the service desk and have them do it for me. This can take anywhere from days to weeks and they need to remote access my laptop to do the installation.\n\nThese delays compound with other issues (and my own mistakes) to bring me to today. I'm now four months into this project and still can't run a local instance.\n\nIt seems like the longer it goes on the more mistakes I make on my end. I can't concentrate on solving problems and I can't seem to remember anything. I try to keep notes but it's never enough, and our chat system wipes messages every day so I can never revisit old info. There's too many problems and I no longer expect things to get any better. It sucks to say but I really don't even care to get it working at this point; part of me wants to get fired.\n\nI'm seeking new employment, but worry that the bad habits and work ethic I developed here will carry over to the new company. Wondering if any of you have gone through the same situation and how you dealt with it. No need to call me a shitty developer, I already convinced myself.",

        "title": "Do not blindly trust Bootcamps or sites that aggregate Bootcamp reviews/details when it comes to placement rates/student success stories. Stories inside.",
        "body": "Hello all!\n\nI am a Data Engineer who was able to make the jump from just your ordinary schmuck to someone that gets to write code every day for a decent wage.  I have a bit of a story to tell about my experience, and it might be a little on the long-side, TL;DR will be at the bottom of the post.  I will leave some bullet-points as well so that I can offer advice on what I would do different if I had a time machine and could start from scratch.\n\nNot too long ago, I had to close down my business that I was running, and I had enough cash on-hand to enroll into a Software Development bootcamp.  I will not disclose the bootcamp or my employer, this is purely a post to help out those of you who are at the stage where you are looking at where you may want to study.\n\nWhen it came to looking for a bootcamp, I really had no idea how to tell who was good and who wasn't.  All of my local options were priced in a similar range, and they all claimed a high (90%+) placement rate, with job-placement staff on-site to help you navigate the wild world of job hunting as a Jr. Dev.\n\nI ended up going with a \"cast a wide net with what you learn\" and \"learn at your own pace\" program.  What I found out was \"cast a wide net\" meant that I only got to learn a little bit of each technology we covered.  We went through HTML/CSS, SQL, Javascript, Python and C#/.NET in that order, with a heavy emphasis on .NET (and a little on .NET Core).  \"Learn at your own pace\" meant that we would be enrolling on online courses from places like Pluralsight and doing some skill checks and short coursework developed by their staff... of Jr Devs that ended up working there after they couldn't find a job in the field of their choice (this is confirmed by them to me, not speculation).\n\nWhat's that, you say?  You paid over 10 grand to enroll in online courses and take some coursework developed by people who have zero industry experience?  That's correct.  At this point I want to briefly stop and note that not all camps are like this, I think I maybe just picked the worst of the bunch.  Please don't be like me, ask questions before you enroll like \"who developed your coursework?\" and \"What kind of real-world experience does your staff have?\".\n\nOk, so that kind of sucked, but at least I was going to get help finding a job when this was all over... right?  Not so much.  Our job placement guy was a total disappointment.  While he helped us write our resumes (they all looked the same... more on that later) and did mock interviews, the actual job placement part of his job left a lot to be desired.  He never actually looked for any jobs for me or my peers, instead opting to send us links to meetups around town, which if you have been to them, aren't exactly job fairs (although the networking can be beneficial).\n\nWhen I actually did get some interviews (on my own, no thanks to my job-placement guy) I quickly learned that most companies do not want to hire folks like me with zero experience in the industry.  It is important to note that I went all-in on .NET, and was trying to get a job as a full-stack developer working with OOP (lol, I didn't even learn what an API was at the time as it was never taught to me or brought up in my coursework).  In one interview that I was able to secure, the interviewer asked me about my resume, specifically where/how it was written.  I let him know that it was written with the help of my camp's job placement guy and he flat-out told me that he had received roughly 25 applications from my peers and our resumes were exactly identical.  No idea why I got an interview and others didn't, maybe he was just curious.  I didn't get the job.\n\nIn the post title I also mentioned not to trust sites that promote \"hey go to this bootcamp!\" or \"here is a great story from Unclematttt about his experience with going from zero to hero!\".  This bit is what actually made me want to make this post.\n\nThere is a LinkedIn power-user (again, not going to disclose their name) who reached out to me and was chatting me up about his cool site that helped people just like me choose their bootcamp.  \"Hey Unclematttt, I see you went to XYZ Bootcamp- would you mind writing a review for my site and maybe doing a AMA for our users?\"  I proceeded to tell him my experience was bad, I am pretty sure the camps lie about placement numbers (at least half of my 'graduating' class never even made it into the tech industry), and the job I ultimately got was more of a support role that was at my wife's work.  I actually had to grind my way up to this position by working double-time and developing helpful scripts and applications in my free time.\n\nThe power-user's response?  Silence.  I followed up a couple of days later to ask what their thoughts were, and they never responded.  I guess it didn't really fit the narrative that they were trying to push.\n\nNow that I have shared my experience, I want to note a few things:\n\n* There *are* quality bootcamps out there, I just ended up at one of the shitty ones (do your research)\n* The job situation in my city (known as somewhat of a tech-hub in the region) might not be the same as your city\n* I could have done more to build out my portfolio before applying to jobs and possibly giving a bad first-impression (don't be like me)\n\nHere are some tips that I can share that I think might be helpful if you are just getting into the idea of picking out a school/bootcamp and want to be successful:\n\n* I sound like a broken record here, but DO YOUR RESEARCH on your bootcamp.  Don't put blind trust into what they are *selling* you.  They churn through students and their goal is to just get your money and get you into their program\n* If you are interested in full-stack development, take baby steps and learn everything you can about backend engineering first (what is/how to build an API, how do applications interact with databases, what are the hot SQL and NoSQL technologies in your area to learn, what are containers and how do they work, etc.).  Full-stack devs do not just sprout out of the ground IME, it can take years to become proficient with any given stack\n* What stacks are hot right now?  Are there lots of jobs for ELK?  What about MEAN?  Find something that you like and go nuts on it\n* Personalize your resume.  Start with what your camp/school helps you build, then do something (anything!) to make it different than your peers\n* IME there was more success with Javascript devs from my camp than anyone else.  Consider learning Javascript in detail and some of the more popular frameworks like ~~AngularJS~~ and Vue (I have been informed that Angular isn't hot anymore- I am not a JS dev, so my apologies on that, research what frameworks are popular in your area.  Edit: this is debated below in the comments, so again do research on what Frameworks are popular in your area.)\n* You will likely end up using databases in some way shape or form during your career, make sure you understand the ins-and-outs of various database technologies and how it applies to your stack/languages of choice\n* Develop a solid portfolio.  If you are doing front-end work, this is a lot easier as people like \"pretty pictures\" (my opinion).  Make daily commits on Github (many employers will ask for your Github profile to check it out before deciding to interview you).  Also have a basic-to-awesome portfolio website, and even though we all hate it, get a LinkedIn account.  Consider buying the premium version if you have the cash for it.\n* Try to find a language/stack that you are comfortable with and enjoy and go HARD on it.  Make sure before you make this decision that there are plenty of jobs that want those skills, there is fierce competition for Jr Dev roles, so you will need to apply to many of them (maybe even hundreds) before you land your first gig.\n* Make sure you are in a good place mentally before starting on this journey.  It can be soul-crushing at times, but there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel if you persevere\n\nI could write a whole lot more, but I think that this covers most of it.  Sorry for the long post, this is kind of therapeutic to write out.  Believe in yourself, but also take care of your future self by not making some of the mistakes I did along the way.  If I could do it, anyone can with the right amount of drive.\n\nTL;DR Make sure your bootcamp doesn't suck before enrolling.  Know the local market and what skills are sought-after.  Don't trust sites that paint a pretty picture, this whole process is a total grind.  Believe in yourself and put in the work.\n\nedit: Minor grammar fix.

Especially given that the hiring manager loved the fact I had side projects during interviews?!\n\nHonestly, as a creative individual, I am thinking about leaving software and becoming a plumber. Pay outside London is poor, and what's the point in developing all these skills if I can't use them to benefit my life? I feel so trapped in this career. Am I the only one that feels this way? How do the rest of you deal with these issues? Do you refuse to sign? Or ignore such contracts and go ahead anyway?\n\nUPDATE: UK contracts often state that the company owns everything developed \"in the course of your employment\" (which is exactly the problem with the current contract that I've been presented with). This clause sounds very innocent. But it's not. See \\[1\\]. Note that using your own equipment in your own time does not save you! \n\nFrom \\[1\\]:\n\n>If material which includes IP rights is created outside office hours and/or using the employee\u2019s private resources this may give rise to arguments that the rights belong to the employee rather than their employer, but that is not decisive. The fact that work is done outside normal working hours does not necessarily mean that the work is not done in the course of employment as, for many employees, there is often no clear demarcation of the hours of work.  \n>  \n>The key question to be asked is whether the work was the kind of work which the employee was employed to do i.e. whether it was within the scope of their employment. Could the employee have been ordered to do the work and would it have been a breach of contract for the employee to not do it? The terms of any contract of employment and job description will be relevant, however, these (and duties more generally) often evolve in the course of time and it may therefore not be appropriate to rely on them exclusively.\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] Russell-Cooke associate Emily MacDonald looks at intellectual property rights within the context of the employment contract (2020).

This company really likes the work I do and I enjoy working there.\n\nMy 6-month review is coming up soon and that's when I'd contemplate asking for a raise. At my stage in life and in my career, though, my time is more valuable to me. I am very much able to live my best life and save money on my current salary. I'd like to work one less full day a week. I sincerely believe as well, that this would barely impact my productivity.\n\nWhat are people's thoughts on asking for one weekday off as opposed to an increase in pay?

I have several books I am using as preparation materials (Algorithms Illuminated by Roughgarden, Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, et al, CTCI, and EPI) and I am also trying my hand at some of the practice interview problems on CodeSignal.

I suppose my explanation is reasonable, but how can I convince prospective employers to take a chance on me?\n\nI feel very alone in this process, and it feels like the odds are stacked against me.

This situation became so ridiculous, so I even found a meme based on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the meantime, one of my friends sent me this link \u2014 [https://www.cardinaldigitalmarketing.com/services/seo/](https://www.cardinaldigitalmarketing.com/services/seo/) and told me that I can find myself doing SEO. I wonder what do you think about it? Is it possible to do something in the IT field with a business and marketing degree?",

I am new to this team, working from US team ( no other Developer here in US team)  and need help in setting up my local environment and learn about the project in general. I have told my manager that I need help in these things and he said to reach out to them. Whenever I ping this colleague she is always rude and just does not reply or help. Because of this my work is getting delayed and then she blames all on me and portrays me in negative light. And now it is starting to look like I am not taking initiative and work but in the background I am not getting responses from her and that is what is causing this delay.\n\nI have been doing trial and error on my own to fix the issues and reach out to her after I am no more able to fix on my own. No demo/KT has been given to me as of yet for this project.\nI am now in a lot of stress and my mental health is getting affected because of this. In daily meeting she says let's take it offline but when I ping her she is completely rude. \n\nHow should I navigate this as I need to learn about the setup thing and this is project specific so YouTube/ stack overflow also does not help and I am just a month old to this project and we are in middle of prod release so the work assigned to me is also critical. I have started to feel worthless and its just taking a toll on me. Please suggest how can I bring this up so that it doesn't sound bad but raises my concerns.",

The only offer for a job I've got is as a data centre technician in Europe for one of the big five with a salary in the range \u00a335-40k. \n\nThe fact that I'm offered this job in the first place was a bit of a surprise as I've only really considered going into software engineering. My goal is to build a career in software engineering, but having lived a broke student life for the past 4 years, I'm very tempted by the idea of having a salary as soon as possible. My alternative is living off savings for the next 3-4 months after graduating and applying for software jobs while practicing interviews and personal projects. Another significant con of the technician role will require me to relocate to a place I don't really want to live. \n\nThanks for your help!",

        "body": "Good day all.. I'm here for perspective and curious how others are handling the shift to full remote offers.\n\nOffer:\n\nRemote with the occasional trip to HQ (once a month) -- I'm within driving distance so this is not expected to drag me through flights, etc.\n\nStartup\n\nBase pay > current\n\nCurrently no 401k match or bonus -- \"it's coming\" FWIW\n\n100% health coverage\n\nEquity\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExisting:\n\nSmall Design services team in large org COVID remote but very old school and continued pressure to return to office. By design services I mean other companies come to us to get it done.\n\nParent Org has recovered from COVID slowdown. Our division is beginning but I've spent \\~15 months stringing 10 hour weeks together if that.\n\nBase + Bonus + ESPP + 401k match\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRisk -\n\nObviously there is inherent risk in a startup. I feel there is a risk of layoff in my currently role, I'm surprised I'm still employed TBH, but I'm 1 of 1 for my discipline, so I think it's more about trying to attract work. It's hard to say, \"We can handle all your FW/HW needs\" when you don't have anyone to do it.\n\nVariable pay -\n\nCurrently I have a 20% Bonus target, of which I've never seen more than 2.6%, although I only worked through one Bonus cycle (COVID). I also have ESPP which has a minimum payout and due to COVID had banner returns, all in this could potentially makeup \\~$40k but expected to settle around \\~$15-20k as the world returns to normal.\n\nStartup has equity, if things go well this could return, but it is a hardware/services company. Historically, aside from Roku, we're not hearing that many Cinderella stories. Maybe see a 2x on the strike.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day, I want to work on cool stuff. With young kids, being remote during the pandemic has been a nightmare and a blessing. Being able to reduce daycare bills is a plus, being able to tend to other things at home and not need to fill all my free time away from work with mundane tasks is huge. I don't miss the people in the office, I'm the guy that typically wears noise cancelling all day to work. I compartmentalize well and treat work as work.\n\nI'm curious to hear how others are weighing their options as offices begin to push for return while remote work is simultaneously being flaunted in portions of tech.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nStartup with slightly higher base and full remote vs Public company with historical higher TC and office  demand. How much is full remote really worth?\n\nThoughts?",

I've been here for 1 year, and I'm actually finding my work very engaging, but there are just some issues I've noticed in this job for the past few months that make me feel like I can't work here anymore.\n\nThis discussion is not intended to be offensive, but I don't really know of a \"good\" way to describe my predicament.\n\nAlthough our site is based in the US, 80% of our employees are on visa from a certain southeast Asian country. Some of my American coworkers who were on track for promotion and exceeding expectations under American-born managment were suddenly let go when management randomly got rearranged recently to be a supermajority of people from said country. They were all terminated  within two weeks of the permutation for \"exceptionally poor performance\", and never were they asked to improve/put on PIP. No one who was from this southeast Asian country was let go, even though I'm aware of a few people who are certainly not pulling their own weight. (for example, there's a girl who's been here two years who's still under the trainee permissions group only)\n\nI'm currently under the last remaining American manager, but I'm receiving hints it's only a matter of time before I get moved to one of the other managers, and it's creating a silent sense of hostility that I'm not welcome here because I'm not \"one of them\". I'm not currently on PIP, but I think I only have about 3-4 months left here. I need some time to decompress, not worry about meeting my metrics, and start applying for new jobs, but I don't know how to do that. If I take PTO for a few days to do so, my metrics will fall. We're told that'll be taken into account in our 1-on-1 meetings if our performance suffers, but I feel like it'll just be turned around on me, saying I should be performing well enough that taking PTO shouldn't cause me to fail to meet my monthly goals.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n* Is my only option to just try the PTO route and hope management doesn't try singling me out for it?\n* With about one YOE, am I likely to be able to get out of here in 3-4 months, or do I need to take something else temporarily in the meantime, and try again later? Would that hurt my prospects to quit ***this*** job, go do something irrelevant for a few months, and apply to relevant jobs again afterwards?",

They got hit by Covid-19 and had to lay off devs because they are in the travel industry, so now they're rebuilding their team. I passed the tech interview, and final interview with a member of their exec team. They seem like a good company overall. I got an offer, I didn't say I accept but will consider and passed all the criminal background checks, reference checks, within 2 days since this was through a recruiter. I hadn't heard the terms of the offer yet and hadn't signed anything or even the terms of the offer.\n\nCompany B came around nearly the next day as my first interview with Company A  and I really progressed to the point I got a written offer and employee agreement from them before Company A did. Company B is a really good work environment from the reviews and others I've talked to who had worked there, and I also use their site regularly. Also an added bonus, they paid $10k higher than what I asked. I'm considering this one since I've gotten so much more information upfront.\n\nI got the call that I got the offer from both companies within 12 hours of each other. Company A at 4:30pm on a Thursday and Company B at 9am sharp on Friday, which happened to be only an hour before an intro interview with a completely different company, which I attended but passed on doing a technical interview.\n\nWhile Company A does a background/criminal check this week, Company B has come back just 3 days later than expected with their offer in writing. Even though I've never signed anything and that I said I will need to consider and read through their offer, it sounds like their recruiter for Company A was under the impression that I had accepted the offer, despite not signing anything. Any idea how to gracefully decline Company A?\n\nFortunately I have two offers. The last job I accepted was my one and only offer with immediate start during my summer off from uni.",

However it was a very unpleasant experience for me because this band-aiding continued for over 1 year and I became frustrated with my work, because I was doing less development and was missing out on cool projects our team was working on, because I was quite literally turning the gears of the business to keep it moving... \n\nI was complicit because I knew I was helping the business and I kept getting promised for months that  they would get me off this work. Eventually they hired some additional resources to offload this work, with the expectation that I would be able to focus on more development... 6 months had passed and I was still doing the same thing... At some level I was still the expert of the things they needed so they still leaned on me heavily...\n\nBecause of this I felt like I wasn't growing enough in my role.

I just wanted to develop and build my technical skills considering I've only been in the industry for \\~4 years (3 of which at this company) I don't feel like I'm at the level where I should be in my technical skills. \n\nAnyways... A co-worker from a different org; I'll call this Pizza Group; reached out to me with a position on their team. This position had all the bells and whistles I could think of. It was R&D in some pretty bleeding edge tech and they were well funded by the group so they bought lots of equipment to play around with for R&D. All in all, it pretty much sounded like a candy shop in comparison to my current position. I would be working on a range of projects/Proof of Concepts, where I have complete freedom in how these projects are built and I'd be using some really cool tech that somewhat aligns with my hobbies and outside of work interests. Needless to say I did apply and was ready to get extended the offer after interviewing with their team. All while burger team was in the dark...\n\nAt this moment I decided to tell my managers at burger group about this opportunity I'm pursuing (before getting extended the offer from pizza group). They panicked and scrambled to talk to the managers of the pizza group and to talk to HR about my internal application. Before the meeting with HR (which was only a few days after I had informed my managers) I had several calls with both of the groups managers. Both seemed to care about what I wanted (What I wanted was to grow my technical skills and get better mentorship to do so, specifically working on cloud applications and microservices and scalability of such things). Both sides made some statements in an effort to convince me to pick them. Burger group offered me the opportunity to work in a different team within burger group that is focusing more on the development side of the things and the things I want to build my technical skills around. The pizza group already had a really exciting opportunity for me to begin with, not to mention it would come with a swanky new title that would make a lot of people jealous given my experience. Pizza group's opportunity comes with a pay raise as well 1 band up and this would go into effect as soon as I join the team. Burger group is prepared to offer me a pay raise 1 band up but wont go into effect until my retention bonus is over.... Ohhh shit... My retention bonus...\n\nThis is where it got really frustrating for me... My retention bonus hadn't expired yet, at least not for a couple months. So pizza group was informed about this late in the process and it definitely threw a wrench in my application, but they were willing to fight for me to make sure I don't have to pay my retention back. Burger group already knew that it would be pretty difficult for me to leave without me having to pay back my full retention. But it wasn't impossible...\n\nAt the end of the day, I ended up going with burger group because I am familiar with the projects and the team and I'd be building my technical skills in areas that would make me more marketable for my next opportunity. \n\nIt's been about 3 weeks since I made the decision and I am just starting the transition to the new team within Burger group, although I am still doing some of the old band-aiding I was doing... But it's more progress than they've ever shown. I only worry that because I am still in burger group, albeit on a different team, they will still reach out to me when they need their expert to slap some more band-aids on the product.\n\nBut every day I can't seem to feel anything but regret for the decision I made... It just seemed like such a fun opportunity, but pizza group weren't as skilled in cloud technologies, so I would have been learning along side them without the mentorship of someone with expertise in cloud or microservices. However these were still people with decades of experience in the industry, so I would have still had some level of mentorship.\n\nA few things I have reflected on:\n\n* I suck at making decisions at the pace they wanted.\n   * I like to think about career decisions for longer than 2 days... but maybe this is just me...\n* I hope burger group follows through on their promise, otherwise it was all for nothing...\n* I made myself look like a flake to Pizza team and feel like some connections were definitely damaged in the process, but they can be repaired with some effort\n* There's too much office drama and I don't know who to believe, but I kept hearing the same thing from multiple people so there must be some truth to those claims...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat would you have done? Did I make the right decision?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I've been in contact with the co-worker from pizza group that brought the opportunity to my attention. They and some other co-workers I've worked with, were all surprised with my decision (but not disappointed or upset with me), making me think I made the wrong one... They feel like there may still be a chance for me to talk to the managers of pizza group if I still wanted to join them because they are still looking for someone... However they may be moving past looking internally and are probably gonna look at external applicants... I also have 3 months left on my retention... IDK why I'm so conflicted...*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR;\n\nI was in a rut of patching production issues and not developing anything of substance both in my job and in my skills. An exciting opportunity came up but out of wanting to build my technical skills and have better mentorship I chose to stay with my current group with the exception that I will move to a different team within the group that focuses more on development.",

Here's my situation:\n\n\n- background/backstory (feel free to skip)\nI'm in my early thirties, have worked almost a decade in tech consulting (implementing/configuring SQL-based tools for things like sales management and accounting). In that time I worked mostly as an individual contributor, with a few years as lead consultant for some bigger projects (switched back to single contributor after a mini-burn out and deciding that being in meetings/writing email all day wasn't for me).\n\nI studied computer science in college back in Europe (about a decade ago) and am currently living and working in Toronto, Canada in consulting for a large organization (I actually quite like the company, I started here about 2 years ago, they have decent benefits/pay, though lately things have been changing slightly for the worse I find).\n\n- challenge/goal:\nI would want to switch to software development, my degree focused on this moreso, but due to circumstances and emigrating I kind of ended up in consulting. I'm finding it particularly challenging to find time/motivation to do side projects and coding after a full day at work (and I probably have some covid fatigue I think, measures downtown toronto have long been quite strict). In terms of prior coding experience: I got a Java certification a few years back and I have played around with  variety of language (Python, Java, C#, Cobol, Javascript etc.), but I find I'm lacking in recent and real world experience (as well as some of the supporting tools and technologies, things like Kubernetes or getting fully up to speed with AWS/Azure and microservice architecture).\n\nI've spent the last few years thinking about making the switch, but have always come up lacking on the execution and I REALLY want to change that. However, I also know that doing this as a side project after work every day is quite likely to fail. For this reason I was thinking of enrolling in one of the coding bootcamps available here, they're quite pricey but I think it might be the fastest/surest way for me to get into a dev role sooner rather than later, which will ultimately help with me develop the required skills further (I like/enjoy studying and learning as part of a job and think I'm quite good at it). My question is what would you do in my situation? Any specific suggestions/ideas or any glaring oversights/flaws that you see with my approach? Also: any experience (attending or hiring from) any of the specific coding bootcamps in Toronto is also most welcome!\n\nThanks all,\n\nR",

I've been programming since I was 18 but I finally decided to become a software developer at 24. I've gone through Unity (C#) and Flash (ActionScript 3) for videogames, and also C, Java, Smalltalk for the basics at uni, then Matlab and other misc languages for misc subjects.\n\nI got my first dev job as a Salesforce Dev at the start of 2020. I'm not a complete beginner, but I still feel that I'm behind regarding experience.

I want to learn more are get bigger challenges. But Salesforce is not providing that for me right now, and I don't know if that is because my current company sucks or because Salesforce is lacking things to teach me.\n\nMy goal these first years is to acquire as much experience and focus on expanding my knowledge.

The coding tasks they gave me to complete were the toughest I've ever been given for a job application. The interview with the leader was also great.

        "body": " \n\nI've been a .Net developer for many years and love the technology, but really dont like the majority of jobs I see for .Net. It seems like the market is quite saturated . Also , I'd say a majority of the .Net jobs these days are 50/50 .Net/Angular/React and Azure based DevOps .. There are a lot of demands for low pay and many employers tell me how saturated they are with qualified applicants for these low pay/high demand jobs. I know .Net is considered romantically appealing and so many want to learn it. It is what drove me to learn it in 2002. Although I was a VB6/ MFC programmer prior to it so got into .Net before it became as well known as today. However, I am starting to think this may not a good trait about .Net.. It has this romantic appeal and corporations that use it have unrealistic views about the framework and expectations of those who use it.\n\nDespite Java, for example, being an even larger framework, I have found many jobs in Java are much more focused on specific development needs and realistic demands. Rarely do I see a Java Spring job description that wants you also to be senior DevOps dev, like I do with many .Net jobs. Good luck ever finding a purely back-end .Net developer job, they are basically non-existent.\n\nI am interested in a framework/language that would be more lightweight, allow for more back-end focused development where I could become more specialized in one area of development.\u00a0 E.g. I hear a lot of DevOps people will do back-end dev with Golang and/or Python which is focused on helping to build and manage microservices.\u00a0 Having to spend a lot of time with React on top of that is pretty rough, but that is what I am seeing in many .Net jobs.  I feel if i am stuck working a full-stack type of job, I might as well just migrate towards Node and have a full-stack JS framework, rather than having to deal with complexities of two large frameworks.. Also, the demand for Azure DevOps is tough , since my background is mostly AWS and I would prefer a role that is more focus on one discipline (web dev vs DevOps) than having to be full-stack web dev/DevOps dev.",

        "title": "Struggling with giving myself a \"title\"",
        "body": "Hey, so I've been self-studying web development, and programming in general for a year and a half now. I haven't applied for jobs yet, because I'm currently doing my one year of mandatory army service, which is not the point, but I wanted to get that clear. However, I've had 2 employers contact me on LinkedIn to go for an interview, one as a Node.js developer and the other was as a Back-end developer. And this was probably a very needed confidence booster, although I've had to turn them down because of my army service.\n\nMy problem is, I have not focused on one tool. Throughout my studying process, I've only focused on getting the fundamentals right along with learning how to build things, no matter what the platform is, nor the tools used to build them.\n\nI've avoided using Angular, React.js, or any other specific framework or library, and stuck with working on all my web projects using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I even avoided using Bootstrap. I have also studied fundamental CS and programming subjects (such as the fundamentals in topics like OS's, Networking, Game Development, Hardware Design, etc.), learned the basics of other languages (C, C#, and Python), and built small things using them, for example, I worked on Linux for more than a year, tackled building a small game in C and did it, worked on small desktop apps using C# and .NET to be familiar with an actual OOP language and a different platform, got introduced to XML, and it gave me a solid ground to work with SVG in a web app I have been working on lately, I also worked on a small Flask project with a friend and helped them debug it and get it live. Note that I've tried to tinker around with all of this just because I want to be a programmer before being a Web developer, which is very important to me.\n\nBack to the Web, I've only been building personal projects, using Node.js for their back ends, along with vanilla JS on the front end. Although I see myself more fit to be a back-end developer, I don't think I know enough to title myself as a specialized \"back-end developer\" yet. I also haven't worked with any specific framework or tool on the front end and I'm not a designer, so I am not sure of that as well. However, I can implement complete designs using HTML and CSS. I have practiced this trying to remake templates I find on the internet by myself and finishing most of them, but I can't actually come up with design ideas myself.\n\nI know I'm ready and capable to get a job once I'm done with this year of service, but the problem is, I don't know what I can call myself or where I specialize in the Web. I'm sure I can build things, I can tackle any problems in a web app, learn the specific tools needed to solve them. I've been through these steps several times and I've completed the apps, but I don't know if this is enough for employers. I see a lot of jobs with specific titles such as \"React developer, Angular developer, etc.\" and I don't know. I'm currently building my portfolio, and I don't know what the title should be. Should I go with a \"Web developer\" or is it \"too general\"? Should I go with \"JavaScript developer\"? Or would it be thought of as me just open to using JavaScript? Thanks for reading through and I would really appreciate any advice!",

After having a talk with my \u201cmentor\u201d (a Sr dev) about the task I am then able to start working on it, and along the way will need help here and there when I get stuck on an issue. Overall, I thought I was progressing and felt good about where I was at.

It\u2019s sort of unclear what this means for my job or what to expect but I\u2019m not sure what to do.

Should I accept this mental break and get paid well to do a job that requires not much thought, but lose momentum in developing? Or do I fight for a development job or find a different company to work with and continue forth as a dev?

For added context, the company has had a massive amount of voluntary turnover and the company basically has no culture at all. It's very much a \"show up, work, don't socialize, leave\" sterile environment and I believe that has caused a lot of folks to find work elsewhere.\n\nSo I got an email from HR where I have to fill out a survey for my job satisfaction. They ask questions about if I like the company culture, how satisfied I am with my job, did the job meet the expectations etc. Then I'm told HR will go over these results with me in a 1 on 1.

        "body": "I'm kind of in a weird situation right now and am looking for some input.\n\nI'm a senior CS student and was lucky enough to land my first paid software engineering internship this summer (I've done 2 others but one was unpaid and one was cyber security). The company I'm working at is a large and has offices all over the U.S. but is headquartered local to me. The pay is relatively low ($15/hr) and the company is a not a tech company. I'm not quite sure what fulltime employees make but I believe it's in the range from $50-65k starting.\n\nMy issue is that my boss has repeatedly told me that he is hoping to extend my internship and potentially hire me full time after I graduate next fall (technically I'm graduating a semester early) if things go well. While I'm super excited and appreciate this, I can't help but wonder if I should be exploring other options.\n\nI'm worried that starting at a local non-tech company might hurt me down the road when I want to move on. I also know that FANNG-like companies are more open to new-grads than other demographics. I'm concerned that it might be a mistake to just take the first job offered to me (if it is even offered).\n\nThe thing is that I have a decent GPA (3.6) but go to a virtually unknown liberal arts college in upstate NY. It might be hard to get my foot in the door coming from a non-target school and one with such low name recognition. However, I have some solid internships and projects on my resume and have made connections with multiple people working at big N tech companies. Also this internship will help me get even more practical experience.\n\nI know it's early to ask this question but it has been on my mind a lot recently and I'm wondering how valid my concerns are. Would I be stupid not to take this job if it is offered? Would I be selling myself short if I did take it? I'm not really sure what to do here.",

        "body": "I've been working for this company for 2 years now. I was originally employed  to work remotely as they were a startup with a grand total of 1 other developer.\n\nAs the team grew, they got an office in a shared space (hated it, 1 hour commute there, 1 hour back) and I went there every day for about 3 months(?). Then Covid happened and back to remote I go.\n\nThey announced the return to office, a different office this time though. This one is closer (40 minutes by foot/bus). We are up to 8 employees now (not including the CEO/CFO), two of them work in **England**. Literally hundreds of miles away.\n\nI honestly can't fathom why they are saying I need to be in the office. I told him straight up (I have always been up front and honest, if not a bit blunt) that I can not afford the \u00a3120 in doggy day care per month.\n\nThe response was \"That's not my problem, these are the things you have to think about before getting pets\". I did think of them, I've been working and delivering projects on time remotely for 2/3rds of my employment here, why the fuck do I need to be in an office?!\n\nThis is a company that I've been putting in 100% into for the past 2 years, working extra hours, going the extra mile. My dog won't be a puppy forever (how the hell can people even afford to have kids?!), but with the tone I doubt a compromise will even be considered.\n\nI've even been rejected a pay rise this year, I am currently sitting on \u00a330k per year, about \u00a34k less than competing jobs and my peers of similar experience.\n\nOur office is in an industrial block. In the winter it's cold as shit, in the summer it's hot as shit, the bathrooms are awful, there is no where to really eat because the breakroom is tiny  and there is a fucking gym next door that blares awful 100bpm dance music all day and slams weights. It also costs me \u00a35 to get here. So in total, this move back to the office is going to cost me \u00a3140 more per month.\n\nI am fucking pissed and now have to go through the hassle of dealing with this confrontation next week and I honestly can't be arsed.\n\nI've always read here that \"*don't be loyal and give them everything, because they will take it al*l\" but felt it was different here, but it's not. It's the same.\n\nI'll never work outside of my hours again and I won't touch a single thing outside of my department.\n\nNot my problem\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes it's a rant, I need to get it out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I know this got an overall negative response, but I thought an update would be in order anyway.\n\nFirst off, thanks to the person(s) who recommended I read over my contract. It actually states that I am indeed fully remote with the possibility of going into the office *one per month* for a company meeting.\n\nI would also like to point out, like another Redditor here has. I am in the UK, we have rights and contracts when it comes to work. They can't just *change their mind* whenever they like. So I have a right to be upset, I put in the time and thought into getting a breed of dog that fits around my working hours and got him as a puppy **because** working remote was what was agreed at my time of employment.\n\nAlso to all the people that say \"dog doesn't need daycare\" or \"just leave them at home and get someone to pop in to take them for a walk\". Yeah guys, it's a puppy. They can't just be left alone for 7 hours a day with zero stimulation. There is a perfectly good reason why shelters have a ton of dogs aged between 1 and 2 years old.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "Hey,\n\nI have been working at this small software company for about 2.5 years now as a full stack developer (first job after graduating with a CS degree). The company only has four employees and only two of us are developers (the current director of technology and me). It is still a young company so we are still very actively developing the product, which is a web application used by large businesses in their day to day operations.\n\nYesterday we had a meeting and it was announced that our director of technology is stepping away from his full time position to a more part time/consulting role where he'll only be putting in 10-20 hours a week. Later I was told by our main boss that he and the director of technology talked about how to go about this and the director of technology was adamant that I was capable of filling the role. He mentioned that he needs a few days to put together the numbers but then we'll talk about an increase in compensation since I'll be taking on more responsibilities. I'm not sure if my title would change or not.\n\nI am confident that I can do the job, but I am a little concerned that the compensation increase may not adequately reflect the responsibilities that I'm being given. I am currently being paid below market for the area especially considering I already had a ton of responsibilities, so I'm worried that the new compensation will only really get me up to where I probably should have been in the first place. I have also been in the process of interviewing with a different company in the last few weeks to try to get a better gauge on my market value but I'm still in that process so I haven't received an official offer from them yet to compare against, but from the looks of it I would be paid considerably more at that company.\n\nHow do I go about negotiating this if the salary my boss pitches to me is below my expectations? I only have 2.5 years of experience but at the same time they're asking me to fill a role of someone with 20+ years of experience. What is reasonable for me to ask for? Should it be more than a mid level developers salary?\n\nSome more info about the business:\n\nEven though its a young company that could still be considered a startup, I know that we're very stable financially and the last few months have been especially good to us. To my knowledge there are no immediate plans of hiring another person. So in theory with the director of technology taking a step back there should be plenty of funds to add to my compensation... Also for what its worth I really enjoy working here. Everyone is great and the culture is very relaxed.",

I'm sure that I want to work as a software engineer(not a data scientist) and I have opportunity to study cs and I'd like it but not as much as math and I really want to major in math instead of cs. And double major is not a choice in my uni(I don't live in US). Getting masters in cs after bachelors is a choice but it is very difficult to get a high gpa in math in my uni, on the contrary it is easy to get a high gpa in cs... \n\nThe rational choice here is to study cs, definitely, but really, how much do I need to choose the rational way to get what I want(having a stable and high-paying software engineering career)? \n\nI'm aware that wasn't a clear text but my thoughts aren't too :/ \n\nI'd like to hear your thoughts, please.",

        "body": "I appreciate this is a pretty broad question, but my search is pretty broad. I'm an embedded systems developer with ~5 years experience, and a pretty broad engineering and CS background. I think I'm pretty good at looking at things from a systemic level and considering technical factors which might affect them. A lot of work I've done is system integration rather than hyper-specific low-level dev (although that I've done too).\n\nHowever, I'm still struggling to see how to transition my career from being a developer to contributing to decisions on *what* gets developed given a problem. I've joined a very young startup a couple years ago specifically to address this, as I was promised an influence on the direction of the company. Of course this proved to be not the case. Yes, as the person leading development of our embedded product I have a good degree of control of how things are implemented, but I have no input into the conversations around \"how we as a company can help our customers given our product\". Any promise of that in the future always get trumped \"temporary\" business needs of me needing to churn out more product as code monkey doing what it's told. All that makes me feel like I should be more actively deciding on a career realignment instead of hoping it would happen organically. Because what I see ahead of myself is just getting more and more shoehorned into being a developer.\n\nHas any of you have made a jump from development to something with more higher-level problem solving? What's your story? How did you find yourself there?",

        "title": "Career after cancer",
        "body": "Long story short, I am early thirty guy living in the Netherlands. Originally studied physics at Uni, even went on and did a phd because I was passionate about the topic. Left academia and has been working as a developer in the whole \"Data\"-business for the past 6 years. I don't like buzz words but titles have come and gone so much, but just to give an idea of I am doing I have been called things such as data engineer,data scientist, big data develeper and even machine learning engineer etc.... The past 4 years I have been working as an independent contractor (zzp), as I enjoy my freedom.\n\nUnless a fellow colleague in the Netherlands corrects me, the tech industry scene is not great there. So I have mostly worked in Brick and Mortar companies (telco, finance, retail, logitistics, fashion etc..). While covid19 obviously meant externals getting laid off, and I was no exception there, it became also a blessing for my career as a lot of companies are seeking contractors in other countries. This is were I got a taste of working at a tech company, tbh still surprised they were hiring contractors. There is a clear noticeable difference in mentality between tech and brick&mortar people. It was an amazing experience to have such talented and motivated colleagues. More on that later.\n\nSadly, things are never easy, I was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer a couple of months ago. Unsurprisingly, I had to let go of my current contracts to prioritize my treatment. \n\nI am about three quarter into the treatment process now. It has been not easy of course. You think you will be the exception, and that you will overcome the side effects, but they hit you like a truck.\n\nSomehow by miracle, I was able to negociate a contract with another tech to start towards the end of my treatment. In the period of my treatment, I was approached as well by two FANG companies for remote permanent. Out of curiosity, I followed the process with one of them and was even invited for online onsite interviews. As the side effects were intensifying, and I stopped the process.\n\nWork has always played a very central role to me. I am very passionate. Being able to improve and push myself to master my craft is very important to me. Cancer, however, is making me question a bit where I want to go with my career.\n\nAs I mentionned at the beginning, I worked mostly at Brick and Mortar. While I respect the people I have worked with, I do think B&M are the worst and most depressing places to work at as a developer. I often like to compare IT departments with Coat Hangers. Nice to have in the house, looks fancy and it's fun to display your coats (developers), but of course you rarely wear most of them (i.e. you can easily get away doing nothing for months and nobody will notice nor care). Everybody is different and , yes, some do enjoy the peaceful life of low pressure calm work. In my case, I have always needed action. I spend quite a lot of time initiating a lot of projects while working at these companies. It always felt I was a mule dragging a cart while 3-4 other people would pull in other directions. As you may guess already, I definitely was not the greatest friend with my managers. I do, however, take pride that I worked on some of the most innovative projects. I count myself lucky, despite the fights, that my managers's managers always saw me in high regard and always provided me with great recommendations which allowed me to keep moving forward.\n\nSince the cancer, however, and not being in my twenties anymore, I fear I will not have the energy anymore to fight similar battles. The though of working as contractor again at brick & mortar makes me almost as nauseous as my chemotherapy. I don't think I will always be able to work as an independent contractor with tech companies. Possibly, renouncing my freedom and  taking the opportunity to work as an employee at FANG (Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google) could be interesting, but looking at glassdoor it looks like I would be making less than I am making now (at least if I have a decent year with 10-11 month billeability).  My problem as well is that I am not really interested in working as a manager. I love working as an individual contributor. Bossing people around does not interest me. I want to refine my craft, keep innovating and building exciting stuff. This is one of the main reason I am   less interested in working as a employee. Being an employee feels like you are stuck in some cage where the only way to grow is climbing the ladder. I hate all the politics and petty backstabbing for silly meaningless titles. I take pride in what I create, not whatever non-sensical imaginary title or how many people are sucking up to me.\n\nHow would people want to move forward? Are there maybe some interesting companies and projects in the Netherlands I am not considering?",

My city is one of the most expensive in Portugal so I would expect a bit more, but that's fine I wanted to start working.\n* From the second day since I was hired they put me on tickets giving me deadlines of 1 day up to 4 days.

I am an entry level, as much as I like learning new things it is impossible to learn in a good way and at the same time solve the ticket before the deadline. I am also afraid to make mistakes because of my lack of knowledge. For now I have respected the deadlines but I had to hurry a lot.\n* They don't explain anything, they just say \"this is the project, clone it and solve the tickets\". If I have a doubt they obviously are very busy so there has been a time where I waited for 4 hours for something that they then explained in 5 minutes (they could easily explain it in the beginning and I wouldn't have lost 4 hours of work esp with a deadline coming)\n* They put me on 4 projects in the first month, so I didn't have the time to become comfortable with 1 project because I got constantly switched to a new one\n* They are late in paying my first salary\n\nI am very stressed and I don't know what to do.

I'm a  software developer (Junior Mobile Dev - I do mainly iOS but from time to  time I help out in Android project in our company). In November it will  be 1 year since I become professional developer, before I had an  technical cloud support role and been customer service in some VR games  places. So I'm pretty happy with myself and my progress through the  years mainly because I was programming for only 4 years now (since I  started my first studies which I eventually left for my Bachelor of  Informatics degree). Now I'm ending my Bachelor Degree in month or two.  I'm thinking about applying for Master degree in Germany or in some  other country in EU (Netherlands are on my list too :D). I'm from Poland  BTW so it is somewhat a big deal for me while I have really no love for  my country right now and always wanted to see how it is to live in some  foreign country for longer time. But it came to my mind: Did I really  need this masters degree? My studies right now aren't so appealing to  me, I learn much more in my job etc. I have possibility to work remote,  so I could probably just travel and work. What would you do on my  position? Do you think that Master degree will help my in anyway or  maybe it just waste of time if I'm passionate about my work and learning  by myself.

Offer will more than likely start at around 135k per [h1binfo.info](https://h1binfo.info) (roughly a 12% increase)\n\nCurrent Job:\n\nPros: Great flexibility with time off and sick days, 30-minute max commute one way, absolutely wonderful coworkers, caring and empathetic management, great team culture, opportunity to learn a little about a whole lot of things (jack of all trades master of none), you are pushed to get 3rd party certifications, literally no micromanaging, respect work/life balance and do not expect work off-hours, and they do not fire people\n\nCons: Current role does not translate into a career unless you want to go into management for the department, locked into my current role within the company for two years (I'm about a year and a half in), you are pushed to get 3rd party certifications, little flexibility with working hours (day always has to end at 5 no matter how early I start), 50-70% customer-facing which I want to get away from, standing customer engagements which I also want to get away from, generally most of the expected tasks have become tedious/boring \n\nThis job that I'm at is probably tied for the best I've ever had and I've never had this kind of support from a Manager before - I had something of a nervous breakdown while dealing with some substance abuse issues a few months into quarantine. Without any hesitation, he gave me a whole week off and checked in on me to make sure that I was doing well. \n\nWith all of that said it is definitely a difficult choice for me to even consider leaving the company. However...\n\nWhat I know/been told about the new position:\n\nI will be part of a new department within the company so there is an opportunity to be at the start of something from the ground up (fast-paced start-up style type of growth), flexible working hours, will be about 20% customer work (no scheduled, standing customer meetings only working on tickets), 45-60 minute commute one way, could potentially offer a shuttle to the office (still WFH until further notice, probably until August)\n\nI'm at a point in my life where it would behoove me to make as much money as I can until the next big thing, which is moving out of the country and marrying my fiance. I'm going to a place where 50k USD translates to 200k locally which you can live on very comfortably for about 3-4 years so it would be great to max out the USD earnings. This company that I am applying to also has offices in that country as well. While there might be a possibility for a transfer, there are roles there that I would be qualified for if I had to reapply\n\nWith all that said if the current job I was at wasn't almost perfect, this wouldn't be a difficult decision. I've always followed the money throughout my career in tech and it's worked out well so far which is why I'm feeling like I should do the same here. I'm also considering having that big name on my resume as well. But this time is definitely different and I for sure am heavily considering how great management has treated me up to this point. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this and to get this far. Any and all insights are appreciated! Thank you in advance",

        "body": "I\u2019m soo glad that I finally got a job in tech that is paid and it is an internship. I have lurking this subreddit since 2018 and I cant believe my time has come!\n\nMy background is that I am graduate from a small college in Canada majoring in CS. I always believed that you needed coop to land internships but I was clearly wrong. I sent over 2000+ applications and went on approximately 50 interviews. In the end I ended up volunteering for a company as a software developer. My CTO saw that I was hard working and putting in 110% of my work and decided to offer a paid position in the company for the summer.  I will be working Software Engineer Intern( though ill be mostly doing QA work hehehe)\n\nMy advice, don\u2019t give up. Keep trying because when you give up you\u2019ve admitted defeat. Also if you can\u2019t get an internship or a FT job, work as a volunteer part time, you will make alot of connections and you gain alot of experience. If not you\u2019re into that then work on side projects, they helped alot in making my application look more appealing.\n\nMy plan for the future is to get into my masters hopefully , grind Leetcode and DS and Algo and hopefully get another internship or a FT role.\n\nGood luck everyone, you will definitely succeed.\n\nLink to my sad post, I made a few months back: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mnva5k/cant_find_a_job_sad_post/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

        "body": "Edit: I started off this post with the intention of asking one thing but it changed somewhere along the way into the entire situation Im in.\n\nI'm a 2020 grad who started his first job in September. My company made all the new grads undergo a couple of months of basic training of things like Python, SQL, AWS etc. I finally joined my team in mid-December and after a couple of weeks of getting permissions, setting stuff up etc, I started getting assigned work from Jan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts been five months now and I have not really done much - the majority of tasks assigned to me are of one of these types:\n\n1. Bugs which have been resolved in other versions of the product, where I basically have to replicate the changes made. A lot of these are assigned to me with the idea that I will be exposed to diff parts of the codebase and get more functional knowledge of the product\n2. Minor UI changes\n3. Writing of some selenium tests which are pretty basic and generally follow the same format\n4. Automation related tasks - run an automation suite, analyze whether all tests passed. If not, raise issues for the ones which failed\n\nTo be very honest, I have gone into auto pilot mode the last couple of months. With the pademic still going on and the monotony of wfh, my motivation was completely gone. Back in 2020, I was interning at a 'better' company but due to multiple reasons, one of them being covid, I did not get a full time offer. Recently I had seen folks with < 1 YOE applying to and getting into some top companies which I had deemed unlikely as I thought companies would not be willing to hire someone who is between the 0-1 year mark in experience. But on seeing this, I started leetcoding and stopped putting any effort into my actual job. I had started basically copying the code changes which I needed to replicate without even trying to analyze them, procrastinate on the other work as well.   \n\n\nI ended up giving a few OAs (Linkedin and a few good local product companies) and did not get through them. On getting some advice from some more experienced people, I am considering staying put until around July -August when I can pass off as a 1 YOE guy and then applying again, and continuing to improve at LC in that time. But now its starting to hit me that it will soon be close to a year without me having done any actual coding and Im not sure what I will say when asked in interviews about my experience. I wanted to get this sub's opinion on this situation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone been in this sort of situation where they were not getting any major work as a new grad and their coding skills suffered as a result?\n\nI am considering applying to other places and am doing leetcode prep on the side. One thing which worries me is what I would say when asked about my contributions at my first company. All I can really say is that I completed my tasks(without being proactive tbh) and delivered requirements on time. Would this be accepted? I see so many people who put on their resumes about what they designed or built etc etc\n\nHow do I bring this up with my manager? Should I be honest with him that I had kind of slacked off the past couple of months and not been making an active effort to learn the codebase(which is insanely vast and I still am not confident with).",

I began to work at the same company I did my internship with (a very very large private corporation). Ive been there for about two years now and am leading a lot of development and architecture in my group as the lead has moved to a different team so the amount of work I have is substantially more than a year ago. I\u2019m in south central Kansas so cost of living is pretty low. \n\nI have been getting a lot of recruiters messaging me so I decided to see what was out there in the market. \n\nAfter a few interviews, I got an offer from a large consulting company (considered big 4 on the business side). \n\nNow I want to lay down my situation and see if anyone has any wise words. I don\u2019t have anyone in my personal life that I could speak to and could relate to my situation so I thought I\u2019d ask here. \n\nCurrent Compensation: 77k (possible 5k raise by end of this month). 401k matching, full benefits. Full time, salary, rarely work more than 40 hours. I\u2019ve really enjoyed my time here and enjoy the people I work with, although I would like to get out and experience more of the world since I was raised here in Kansas. There is also a strict business casual dress code and working remote or from home is very limited. \n\nNew offer: 95K, full remote, option to work in DC or Austin, TX if I prefer to have an office. Similar benefits although the 401k matching is a bit weaker ($0.25 per dollar up to 6% vs 100%% up to 6%). This gives me the chance to own my life a bit more and flexibility to move to a new city in the future without having to find a new job. \n\nI am feeling very stressed about this decision and not telling my current employer about the situation. I\u2019m worried that I could do poorly at the new job or be falling behind when at my current company I\u2019m doing extremely well.

My issue was that I was working 7 days a week and having almost 0 time to actually dedicate to my PhD and with the lockdown rules I think matters just became worse as I was in a new surrounding without any support locked up and with very little social interaction or even free time and breathing space  . Bottom line is that I really want to pursue research , specifically in HCI and using technology as means of accessibility for people with various disabilities ( my initial focus was on limited motor skills ) . Is there any way I could pursue this given my academic experience + 4 years of software development experience or are there any suggestions for alternative paths ?\n\nThank you for your time and insights",

        "body": "I'm now on my 7th month with my 2nd team at my current job as a software developer. I moved to this office with the aim to learn more.\n\nPIP - is Performance Improvement Plan. I know that it's given to an employee if he fails to meet the target for a period. \n\nToday, I was invited to a meeting with no subject which I attended. To my surprise, it wasn't about regularization, instead it was about PIP that I never was warned before.\n\nOur office is a contractor and has clients abroad. During the meeting, my manager simply showed a PIP form and explained that it's being issued to me because I didn't meet the metrics and expectation of client. That's when I started to get confused. \"No specific metrics were discussed to me since I joined\" I thought that I jist need to work on the task assigned to me per sprint.\n\nSome of the metrics/target I saw on the PIP are about ensuring at least >=10 lines of code merged per sprint, ensuring that you avoid getting task carried over to next sprint etc. All of which were never discussed to me since I joined the company. And now, there I was in the meeting being issued a PIP right on my face when I wasn't even oriented about the goals. No warning, no monitoring, just straight PiP that they said I need to acknowledge.\n\nI expressed my confusion and feelings about it to my manager(contractor side) and he told me that they will help and that I just need to get through it. In other words, just accept it. And that they didn't know about those specific metrics of client, which I find a miss on their part. They just told me that my feedback will be communicated and feedback is appreciated.\nI got so pissed because I think it is so unjust and unfair to just issue a PIP to an employee when on the other hand it's them who failed to communicate to me what my metrics are. And I'm on my 7th month, not even a year. How the hell would I know those specific targets if they don't identify and ask those from client. There are sprints where there are only UX tasks. (I do backend btw)\n\nTheir miss, my record/reputation's expense.\n\nSorry, I'm a little getting carried away.\nNow, I've been thinking that I wouldn't want to stay in an office with that kind of system and management. I'm only on my7th month. In my previous offices, shortest stay was 2.5years.\n\nI am now planning to look for another office and apply actively then leave my current office once hired.\n\nBut, I would like to know your thoughts and advice on this matter. Cause maybe, someone here had experienced something similar. What did you do OR What would you do if I were you?\n\nTo add, our client in US, recently laid off their employees in US. \n\nYour thoughts will help.\n\nThank you!",

        "body": "Hi all, I am a HVAC mechanical engineer (recently received professional designation) however for a while now I\u2019ve been more fascinated by how we do business vs. actually doing the core business work. \n\nAs a result, on the side of my regular duties, I have been creating simple scripts and trying to leverage the power of the data contained within our design software to do calculations to speed up workflow. A bunch of these simple tools are in use by our team at present. The software in its basic interface has the ability to create logic trees to relate data/calculate using only IF, AND, OR, NOT and all basic math (in a way like a worse version of excel). \n\nI was struggling to find the time to spend working on these new methods and kept being pulled back into the core business which I did not like. Eventually I got fed up and gave notice to leave - however, after doing so my company offered me a position to work on the development side full time. \n\nThe company has a small group that develop tools/addins (C#) and web tools (JS) for workflow enhancements. So joining them was effectively exactly what I was looking for! \n\nI guess I am a bit nervous to jump on the team not being skilled in C# or JS at all. I\u2019m expecting some effort on my part will be required initially to learn the concepts but I guess looking for advice from anyone else who may have made a similar transition? I have a bunch of new tools/workflows in my head but don\u2019t have the skills, at present, to implement them.\n\nThanks for reading!",

I have been fairly successful with getting at least one interview from about 30% of the companies I have applied to.

Admissions are tough though and I'm not sure I'll get in however, I feel like I'll get math, which then allows me to specialize in a specific stream such as stats, computational math, combinatorics/optimization, etc. Alternatively, I could go to a different school for CS which won't be as strong but decent nonetheless (schools like Queen's University, Western University, University of Toronto - Scarborough). **My question is, should I go for a math degree at a school with great education/networking or a CS degree at a school with decent education and networking, but nowhere close to the level as Waterloo?**  \n\n\n I'm currently interested in pursuing a career as a data scientist, I may consider SWE in the future but I'm not sure how difficult the transition will be, especially if I am a math major.\n\nFor further context: Waterloo has CS in the math faculty, so I will be taking a few CS courses throughout my program as a requirement and I might take a CS minor.

        "title": "A Rant And Could Really Use Some Advice - At A Crossroads In My Career",
        "body": "TL;DR - Coming from IT and working in first DevOps role and it's a nightmare. I'm absolutely lost on where to go from here.\n\nTo start, I'm in Canada so I don't know what it's like to be able to apply to hundreds of jobs a week. I don't really have that opportunity where I live.\n\nI'm a little over 3 years in the industry at this point. I worked at an MSP to start. Worked up from the help desk to a project based role and landed a DevOps position 8 months ago. It took time to land this role. I dedicated a lot of personal time to studying, getting certified (Azure Administrator), and working on personal projects.\n\nThings started out ok. I've worked a lot with AWS, Terraform, GitLab for pipelines, a ton of bash scripting, collaborating with devs. I've honestly learned a lot and have done some really cool things with Terraform that I'm proud of but it's really turned out to be a nightmare overall.\n\nThis company is about 50 employees total, been around for about 10 years, and I'm the sole DevOps person there. This is my first DevOps position and I was brutally upfront about my skills and experience but showed a willingness to learn which helped me land this role. Here's some issues I'm having:\n\n* First and foremost, the CEO is a bit nuts. He singles people out in chat and asks things like \"Why did you do this?\" \"Why didn't this person catch this?\" anytime something goes wrong. He flips out anytime there is any issues whatsoever, dropping F bombs in chat when something happens. He micromanages everyone. He'll directly message me repeatedly all throughout the day asking me to look into whatever so happened to cross his periphery at that time which he's now deemed critical. I don't get clear instructions on requirements from him at all.\n* I spoke with my manager about the CEO micromanaging me and he has backed off a little bit recently, but it's still there, and there are so many other problems with this person that just make it really hard to work with him.\n* The CEO \"doesn't do\" tickets, any message received from him in chat is good enough and I should drop everything I'm doing to look into whatever he's asking and most of the time it's way above me. I can't communicate with him through tickets either, I need to chase him down in chat anytime I need clarification on something because he never answers.\n* We have project managers that are absolutely useless. Everything is critical, everything needs to be done by end of day, no clear instructions from them ever.\n* Developers never stop working. This especially includes the CEO. I receive messages from him at 3 AM asking for my thoughts on things, or asking me to fix a deployment he messed up, because despite the fact I've done multiple personal calls with him to walk him through the deployment process, and written detailed documentation complete with screenshots, he still circumvents it, looks for shortcuts, messes things up, then flips out when everything breaks in the middle of the night because he decided to deploy to production.\n* My role isn't clearly defined to anyone else. Everyone thinks I'm the administrator of every single system we have and service we use. Anytime there's the slightest issue with anything I need to drop what I'm doing and fix it. It wouldn't be so much of a problem, but we have like 50+ random EC2 instances that were set up before my time and there is no documentation for any of it. I would love to clean this up, reduce systems, find better ways to run them that's more inline with best practices but I'm honestly just firefighting all day with developers and random other things that get assigned to me.\n* I have no time to really dive into some other things I would like to help grow as a DevOps Engineer. There are so many tools and processes I would love to research and attempt to look into but honestly with the way it's been with the CEO who doesn't listen, doesn't bother using processes I've set up, flips out when there's problems, I've just lost all motivation and desire to even try implementing anything else or improving anything.\n* I've been volunteered as the head of all security policies and runbooks, despite the fact I'm not actually writing anything at all it's being done behind the scenes without my involvement yet they put my name on documents.\n* No documentation for anything except for what I've wrote for the processes / pipelines I've developed. I'm coming from IT and have a solid background in documentation, it's something I've always placed a great deal of importance with.\n* No monitoring aside from some pretty useless CloudWatch alerts / dashboards we have set up. I would love to really dive into this area, and load testing as well, but see my point above regarding the CEO. I've honestly just lost all motivation to start on anything like this because of him.\n* No leads. No code reviews. Everything is under the birds eye view of the CEO. There are people who direct deployments, but they're not developers. There are so many issues with deployments I don't even know where to start.\n* Devs connect to production databases for development.\n* Things are way too fast. I'm talking deployments to production causing issues, anything I ever work on needs to be done ASAP as well. I'm not part of any discussions or meetings outside of the daily standups which are a joke.\n* Daily standups are absolutely useless. The project managers just talk about what's being deployed for 5 mins, while everyone else sits in silence in the call, but then I get singled out and asked what I'm working on and when it will be done. No one has any idea of what I'm talking about and it just feels so awkward.\n\nDespite all of the above, it honestly started out well when I was less in contact with the CEO. I got to really dive into Terraform and AWS, and had fun setting up and learning new things. The pipelines I developed were challenging but fun to work on, and I love seeing them in action. I love helping people, and collaborating with devs to accomplish this stuff with them.\n\nNow, I just look at the place and see how much wrong there is and I can't fix all of it. I can't fix the culture. I can't change the CEO. I can't fix everything I'd like to on AWS or our processes. It's all just such a mess and I'm so overwhlemed. I'm filled with anxiety every time I start something when there's something else that's being put off that I should do. It's unsustainable.\n\nI took the last week off and have been hammering out applications (I've actually been doing this for the past month), but I'm getting nothing back. I'm trying to go for DevOps / SRE positions and am trying to stay remote, but I'm not getting any interest.\n\nSo here I am, I have less than 1 year in DevOps, and a little over 2 years in IT. I don't know if I should keep trying for DevOps / SRE positions, or just give up on it since I'm not getting any interest back. I've thought about going back to IT, but I honestly don't think I have it in me to go back to something so service oriented.\n\nI'm so lost and just wondering if I should just give up on the tech industry altogether.",

        "title": "Non-CS Grad Seeking Guidance for Career Path",
        "body": "I am looking to enter the Software Development scene. I have my BBA in Marketing, but originally wanted to get a degree in CS however this never happened due to my lack of knowledge of how college really worked (First Gen Graduate). I got my general undergrad coursework done at a local community college and then transferred to a state college, during this process I found out that if I wanted to get a degree in CS, that I would basically have to retake much of my general coursework as it was going to require that I get much of the foundational coursework done despite already having my associate degree. So essentially I was looking at going to school for another 3-4 years to get a CS degree vs continuing with a business degree in 2 years. Due to financial/time constraints, I went the BBA route (and highly regret this decision).\n\nTwo years ago I graduated with my BBA and have been unable to find anything professionally in the field. I am about to turn 25 years old and am feeling like if I want to make a career/field change, now is the time to do it. It doesn't help I'm not really interested in Marketing, but I am interested in software dev as I feel that it would be much more in my spectrum of interests and fit me as a person better. I have a little self-taught knowledge of python/html/css/js, but nothing significant enough to gain employment. My hope would be to utilize something of my Marketing degree, potentially the UX/UI knowledge that I gained during my studies.\n\nJust some background info: I am married and my wife and I both have income, I would be able to work part-time and attend school/camp if the opportunity arose. She makes enough income to support us both if necessary for a period of time. I live in Arkansas, while there are not a vast amount of employment opportunities in my city, we live pretty close to Little Rock which has some SE jobs posted pretty regularly, though we would be willing to move if necessary. \n\nMy question is this, what would be the best route in my case to reach employment in the SE field?\n\n1.) I have been accepted to my local community college for pursuing a second bachelor in CS, my situation is similar to when I was in college the first go around, I will require all of the foundational classes and since this would be my second bachelor, I would be paying out of pocket/getting loans to pay. Either way, I assume it would be helpful to take some of the intro to CS classes there.\n\n2.) Should I seek a masters degree in CS? There is a college here that offers a \"Master of Computer and Information Science\" degree online and though it prefers students who have a CS background, it does allow for non-cs majors to apply after taking a couple of pre-req courses. This option seems like a good choice, but I get unsure when I consider the fact that I most likely will be lacking a lot of the core foundational knowledge of CS.\n\n3.) I've also considered attending a coding camp though I am a little weary of them. I've looked into Hack Reactor/App Academy/Coding Dojo. I like the idea of getting instant industry applicable skills, but I've also heard/seen some sort of shady stuff with some of the Bootcamps. I also wouldn't be able to lump sum pay for something like this so would need to consider the different financing options.\n\nWow, this post ended up a lot longer than I had hoped for, my apologies, and thank you for your input!\n\n**tl:dr- Non-CS grad seeking SE career. Would the best route of entry be a second bachelor in CS? Master in CS/MCIS through potential online college or bridge program? Coding Bootcamp?**",

        "body": "I'm a Senior Engineer. My team's manager got moved to another team and my lead got promoted to manager. The lead put in his 2-weeks notice, so our team is basically manager-less. This is why our Director of Engineering is managing us right now.\n\nI've been working at this company for 8 months and had my first performance review comprised of nothing but great feedback. \n\nI had my first two 1-1s with the director, the first of which was very casual, but the next was a shocker. I was called out on:\n\n1. Having too many PRs open, closed, and in draft\n2. Having too many commits\n3. Too many comments from others in my PRs\n4. Pushing commented code & code with git artifacts in it\n\nIn my defense:\n\n1. Since the start of the quarter, my team has reprioritized a lot of work, and there hasn't been a discussion about what to do with the work that we all started. Also, I open a draft PR the moment I make my first commit on a branch. I do this for visibility, and in case someone needs to take over the work.\n\n2. I also commit a lot. Commits are my safety net. I use `git reset` tremendously throughout the day to go back to different states in the code I'm working on.\n\n3. The director mentioned that he expects senior engineers to have very little chatter on their PRs. They should be ready to merge with very little discussion. What he failed to recognize that were almost all of the comments on my PRs are from Hound, our linter. Rather than linting before pushing, I actually enjoy waiting for Hound's comments and fixing them afterward.\n\n4. Here I made a mistake. I've been forced to comment out code recently in some of our microservices as a temporary fix while working locally. I forgot to uncomment the code before pushing to GitHub. The director went through my commits and saw some commit messages like \"uncomment code\", \"remove commented block\", and reprimanded me for that.\n\nI've been an engineer for more than 10 years and no one has called me out on any of this. This is how I like to work. I don't see a real problem here. \n\nI can squash my commits, lint locally, and stay blocked when services aren't working on my machine. But I'm mostly concerned about why this director is calling out this bullsh*t.\n\nI spoke to my former manager, and he said it'd just be easier to appease him. But it feels like the director is looking for a reason to let me go by finding incompetencies in my performance. I do not want to work in fear or with paranoia.\n\nShould I have a chat with the director's manager to ask about the feedback and what he suggests I do about it?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**BONUS**\n\nAnother reason I think this feedback may be in bad taste is because of this:\n\nWe've recently been given one of those typical sexual harassment training assignments which were to be complete in a month (due, say, May 15). On my day off last week, I got an email from the director saying, \"I know you're OOO, but we need you to finish the sexual harassment training **today**.\" After checking my email, it was still due May 15th, not May 8th. I completed it, of course (to shut him up), but that still leaves me with one question: Why would this guy message me on my day off with such urgency to complete something that was not even due? It feels like he's really trying to catch me slacking.",

I have only been working in dead end jobs like being a cashier at target and McDonald's for a long time now. I'm very depressed from the poor decisions I have made in life and am yearning to make a change for the better this time.\n\nSo, fast forward to today.

Getting a college degree in computer science, being self taught, or going by way of bootcamps. \n\nThe college route seems like it may be a safer route (correct me if I'm wrong, please), but it also seems like it will cost the most time and money to do so. I have completed some education at my community college many years ago. I mapped out a potential plan with a college counselor, and it would take me 3 years to finish my time at community college, then transfer to a university, which would take another 2 years to finally achieve my bachelor's degree in computer science.

        "body": " Hey Everyone,\n\nI was recently (mid April) Laid off my L1 position where I was contractually working as an L1 Technical Support with a Cloud Project/Process Integration for one of biggest companies in the workspace for a period of one year. I was very much bothered by lack of interest from the management to promote from within despite people working crazy hours or outworking every other colleague. Also for note, this is my only IT experience.\n\nI followed this subreddits as well as [r/ITCareerQuestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) guidance on Resumes, interviews, salaries, career progressions and other.\n\nBecause of that I found myself with two offers in two differing companies. I was not able to decide which one to follow with since.\n\n**Company A.) Graduate Technical Support Specialist**  \n27.500 Euro a year \\~ 25 days off \\~ no other benefits.\n\nThe Company provides software akin to Mobility Management and other things. The type of work as L1 support will allow me to tackle any issues as L1's take full ticket ownership, so if there is a very difficult ticket I can work on it to try and solve if its not over my head.\n\nThis will make me be able to do a work that I enjoy in stable office hours and work with corporate clients who know what they're doing to some degree. I can also work outside of working hours to work on my specific ticket. There's no HelpDesk or anything of the sort so they do not handhold you and wave numbers and quotas above your head.\n\nBecause of nature of the company I think the progress within it will be slow, but they use different interesting technologies and focus on networking a lot which I could apply in day-to-day basis.\n\nIf not for benefits + School which I will explain below I would chose this one.\n\n**Company B.)** **Customer Support Specialist**  \n32.000 Euro a year +5% p/a bonus \\~ 25 days off full dental + health cover for me&fam + other benefits\n\nThis Corporation deals with GRC and in the last year they have opened a new customer support hub that will be the only support hub globally. They use random shifts with new employee logging in on every hour to ensure constant coverage and the job is being done via HelpDesk where the clients call to the customer support representatives.\n\nThey have again and again highlighted that they want technically gifted people to be selected from L1 candidates within about half a year so they can fill up tens of new positions as once again they opened this support hub semi recently so those positions are being made/waiting to be filled.\n\nThey will be looking at numbers and I need to be by my station 24/7 as it often happens with HelpDesk types of scenarios. Also they look at metrics and it scares me a lot because I would love to help people to the best of my ability instead of pushing them out asap.\n\nAlso, those strange working hours would more easily allow me to finish my Software Dev Undergrad where I miss only three classes that need to be taken during the day AND I need to get my dental work done.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI have about 25k saved so I'm not in the worst place monetarily but I'm not sure if I want to take the jump into a work I could potentially hate for half a year where I will know what's what or start looking elsewhere.\n\nThe first Job is more interesting but has lower salary and benefits, as well as possibly much slower progress, but I would enjoy it more and it would be more of technical challenge. The second I will be stressing over metrics over months and hoping they pull me over for something more technical than learning product from 'the kitchen', while simultaneously they provide better benefits/pay and perhaps a career opportunity.\n\nSorry if I'm rambling, I have gotten zero sleep at night over this and thank you everyone for weeks of supporting people here which helped me in turn as well.\n\nThanks everyone!",

The closest answer I have gotten is that 'bootcamp grads usually can't apply to embedded entry level jobs.' (No hate to bootcamp grads though. All respect for anyone trying to hustle to make something of themselves in this world.)\n\nI have heard so much rhetoric about the different types of jobs available to SENG and CS grads, and how those grads don't make 'software stacks'(MERN, MEAN, etc.) their main selling point as a bootcamp grad might. I have heard that once you start defining youself by these stacks, then that usually means you are a web developer. I don't want to become a web developer at the end of the day, but I don't know what to look for in an entry level job description that will keep me off that path.\n\nWhat I am trying to point out, is that there seems to clearly be some distinction about the doors that a CS degree can open, but looking at the market and job ads in Canada, I can't seem to see that distinction in entry level positions. Either the job ads are asking you to be familiar in some software stack and the job is web-dev related, or the experience and tech required is so absurd that I find it hard to believe that any fresh grad would have that experience. I have only checked linkedin job ads though. \n\nWhat kind of entry jobs should I be looking for as a fresh CS grad (and as such, are available to me as a fresh grad), where I would generally not be competing with bootcamp grads? By this I mean, what search filters should I be using to find such positions, or what should I look for in job descriptions to keep me away from jobs heavily applied to by bootcamp grads?

        "body": "Hi all,\n\nI am currently a CS major and a senior in standing. I switched from biology to software engineering the end of my sophomore year, so I was very behind and in order to graduate on time and to save me thousands of dollars (from taking extra semesters) I took about 3 summer classes each summer on top of the usual 4-5 classes during a normal semester. I am about to graduate soon, but since I have been rushing and catching up with the large amounts of classes I needed to take in a quick time, I've had no time for internships or any real world situations. Graduating without an internship I feel like is going to make it super hard to get an entry level job, as employers would probably hire someone that has had an internship or CS work experience over me.\n\nHas anyone here been in the same boat? Or has tips for what I should do to stand out as a good hire? I have a few projects on my github, and my senior group project is pretty decent (but is focused on cybersecurity not software engineering).",

        "body": "Hello fine people of reddit. This is going to be an explanation of my situation with a friendly request of pep talk/advice at the end. \n\nBit of background: I graduated 4 years ago with a CS-lite degree. \nIt's focus being on networking and security with a side of information management. It taught me the fundamentals of how to troubleshoot effectively, think critically, and most importantly self teach. Now due to my youthful foolish college ways I graduated with a not so attractive GPA (2.7 but whose counting). As such I pounced on the first job offered which ended up being entirely SQL based. Though I had exposure to SQL it wasn't something I had known in depth. Despite this the requirements for the job were low as was the pay. (I'm not trying to sound ungrateful, it remains one of the biggest pride points for me though now being slightly seasoned I am aware what the standards for the industry are.)\n\n\nFast forward a couple years, I am still in the same city I moved to for the job. I have established friends and a girlfriend I'm very happy with, things are nice. (Enter life and uncertainty) The small software company I work for gets bought out and recent restructurings have made me want to look elsewhere.\n\n\nMy personal problem is that I've been on a SQL only diet for about 4 years now and getting mixed messages from the internet as to the viability of that skillset long-term. My preferences for work I have found are being back of house interfacing with customers as little as required though I can do it when necessary and get complimented on my people skills. What I want to do isn't being a BA or manager-type however it's to be a dev/software engineer. I know I need a real scripting/programming language to move into that but it's all so daunting. I've been saying for a year now I'm gonna learn C# (my shop is .NET) but have not nearly but in enough hours to even grasp the fundamentals.\n\n\nIn all honesty half the reason I'm even looking towards other jobs and at my career is I don't want to be stuck with the legacy doom projects all my colleagues are leaving me with. I have a general sense of what I want and now have urgency but I simply lack the skills to make it happen. Do I do leetcode? Do I get back to school to get a CS degree? Bootcamp? There's so many options and it's overwhelming me into a mode where I do nothing and simply try not to think about it.\n\n\n**TLDR; Database dev wants to be a real dev/swe and is in paralysis on how to achieve.**\n\n\nGonna leave the tag as experience.....it's just the wrong experience haha....",

I lost my job found contract work and I was out of work for a little while at the beginning of the year. Two weeks ago I started a new position after two technical conversation interviews. I was offered a new position and my gut feeling was to hold out and keep applying. I did not follow my gut feeling and ended up accepting it. Here is the part where I feel a bit baited.\n     During my initial conversation I was told this position would be on site and that the team was currently commuting to the location of the client (kind of far from the main office). I was told that there were other developers working on the project actively. On the day that I start I am told no one has started on that assignment and it may not even happen. My current assignment is getting up to speed with a technology (AWS) I have not worked with for the potential opportunity to work with a client. I've done a little background on their past teams conversations and it seems like a lot of people left last year due to no new projects. I feel like I am being benched already, I've talked with managers about how better I can spend my time day to day. The conversations have not really gone anywhere. I'm currently trying to look for other positions to keep myself ready in case of the worst case, but I wanted another opinion. I feel mislead on what I was getting into, but at the same time I need to try my best to keep work duties as expected. I just wanted to get opinions from other people in the tech field sorry for the long read. Good luck everyone out their looking for jobs its tough out here.",

But the HR told me that FB only hires either new students (9 months within graduation), or highly experienced engineers with at least 5 years of FAANG experience. He/She told me that my startup experience won't count to anything with regards to these FAANGS, and I'll be seen as a junior or at most mid level engineer when i leave the startup to any organization.

I was chasing the dream of executive management, but now that I am working daily with VPs and C-level people I realize it is nothing but massive problem after problem, politics, and long hours (evenings and weekend). I also realize my job has too much responsibility, too much stress, and is too people oriented. I think about my work 24/7 - I wake up in the night thinking about it.  That said there are tons of perks with my job, I have complete freedom over what I do each day (it is 100% up to me what I do - sometimes this drives me nuts) and no one is watching me work (I'm supposed to be watching others work). Every now and then I get into incredibly interesting initiatives and see first hand how the business is run from the top level. But I just can't see myself doing this for another 20 years.\n\nWhen I look back on my university scores I realized that my best grades were in programming. I loved programming, and was good at it, but I was always afraid it would be flooded with cheap labour and it wouldn't continue to pay well. Now that I am in a management position I can clearly see that will never happen - the quality from offshore firms is dumpster-tier and we only leave the most basic menial programming jobs to offshore. (sorry to my offshore friends- every now and then I meet one of you that is rockstar-tier).\n\nAll this said - has anyone else been in my position? Did you make the jump and how did it go? I'm afraid I'm going to miss the massive freedom I have in my position, the direct access to upper management for mentorship, the high pay ($125K+ base in a non- tech hub). That said I would love love love to have someone just tell me what to do and I can pop in some earbuds and sit down and code away in peace. I am not a social person, but I'm also not a recluse - I enjoy talking with people and making friends (something that went up in smoke once I got my first management post). But for the most part I am happier to be working solo.\n\nMy degree was a mix business/information technology, so I already have a base of programming, database, systems analysis -  I'm not starting from zero. Plus I've been around the IT world for 15 years. I've done hundreds of interviews and I can interview really well. I am thinking of going Python + Javascript + SQL route to build a baseline full stack skillset. I know html/CSS already. My biggest concern is getting a position that I can learn in. Oh yeah, I'm 45 so I wonder if this is going to be an issue.\n\nAny feedback from someone who has already been here is appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. if you are in the opposite situation (going from software dev to project management) message me if you need any advice.

I really hate the job but the money is good and moving again would incur costs (in my country there is no such thing as relocation costs) + the job market here sucks for new grads.",

This is just a front, and entering a command will prompt them to switch to GUI mode because of some obscure error. Then the actual portfolio appears. Everything can be seen without scrolling as I have used a lot of GSAP to animate elements into/out of view.\n\nThe general approach I took to present what I've worked on is the following:  \n\\- Give a broad overview of the project.  \n\\- Talk about the most noteworthy stuff during the development period (I get rather technical here)  \n\\- Show some illustrations  \n\\- Rinse and repeat\n\nNow, two weeks into the development of my portfolio, I am feeling some self doubt and I am wondering if my approach is any good. What do you guys think? Should I just start from scratch and take the more traditional approach? Or maybe, as a recruiter, you're more likely to choose someone with a portfolio that stands out?",

However, I doubt those degrees will mean much in computer fields \ud83d\ude04. I am primarily working in health sciences-related chemistry (ie therapeutics) so it's not like my math is exceptionally strong\u2014 though I have taken multivar calc and linear algebra in college. After spending so many years in the lab, I realized that I don't really want to be a chemist for the rest of my life, and I'm not at all interested in staying in labwork. I also strongly dislike academic culture. And I much prefer to work at a computer.\n\n\nRight now I'm working through The Odin Project, which gears you up for webdev. I'm not that entirely interested in webdev as a career, but from what I read, it is easier to get a job in as self-taught. As a chemist, I enjoy brainstorming solutions and thinking about troubleshooting issues but I don't actually enjoy the physical labor of chemistry (I'm not interested in working with statistics so thats why I have ruled out cheminformatics and data science related to health sciences).\n\n\nSo,\u00a0 I think I would be into software engineering but the barriers of entry seem much higher. And I have been in school so long, IDK if I want to go back just for a CS degree lol.\u00a0I don't mind self learning at my own pace though. Or  online Master's are even worth it?  My plan is to finish The Odin Project (Ruby on Rails pathway), do some projects, then learn C/C++ and read a couple computer science books (like on DSA) but then what?\u00a0 How to translate webdev projects into software engineering skills and demonstrate competence to land a job in software engineering?

        "body": "Hi All I need a bit of your help with my career progression. I have been working for a consulting firm for more than 10 years now in Data Analytics field(Building Reports/Dashboards). For the most part I really enjoyed it as I was working for different clients up and down the country. The projects usually lasted for not more than 5 to 6 months. Around 4 years ago I developed my interest in Data Science(DS) my company gave me couple of DS related projects which were great and I learned a lot. Then 2 years ago, I was given a project(let\u2019s call it Project X) that has absolutely nothing to do with Data Science and I\u2019m still working on this project. When I was given project X I got really annoyed as I knew that all the knowledge I gained from my DS projects will now be lost. I got really frustrated and started looking for job elsewhere just before Covid. As you know things were a bit unstable during Covid so I thought lets suck this up stay and stay with the Project X until Covid is done. The problem with my job is that I have no say over my career path. Recently I have come to realisation that maybe I should not only change my job but also my career path altogether.\nI have recently developed my interest in Software Engineering(SE) and I want to ask for your advice if you think switching from Data Analytics to Software Engineering is a wise move? I\u2019m not sure even if I\u2019ll be able find any job in SE that will match my current salary but I feel like there is much more potential to grow in SE than in Data Analytics/Data Engineering. With SE I\u2019ll be able to work for a company as well as the knowledge I\u2019ll gain, I can use it to do my own side hustles in Web Development domain. I think SE is much more dynamic field than Data Engineering. I have MSc degree in Software Engineering and I\u2019ve been doing on and off coding in Python and R for the last couple of years and I think I have decent technical background. I also don\u2019t mind learning and picking new languages such as Java.\nWhat are your thoughts?",

After reading 20 or so research papers I now have a great understand of what worked for other people and techniques in which to build a better (more functioning) system.\n\nTomorrow my self and 2 of the managers are meeting to discuss the interview process for our potential new hire. I was going to take this time to address to them what they need to expect from this person and how to manage them. \n\nI\u2019m going to tell them that they may not see any improvements quickly, but that\u2019s what research is. As well as that we just need to scrap the project and rewrite the code base. It just sucks because they have no Ml experience so they don\u2019t know how much time things take. And you could spend weeks just to not get anywhere",

However, a month or so after starting I began applying to new companies for two reasons:\n\n1. I felt like this company wasn't challenging me or helping me advance as a developer; most of the jobs they gave me felt like glorified IT work.\n2. I'm not a fan of the city my college was in; I attended it because they offered me a nice scholarship, but culturally I'm not a good fit for the city, there aren't a lot of networking opportunities, and it's too suburban.\n\nDespite applying, I expected to not find anything until around a year, simply because it's so hard to get anything at entry level to begin with, especially with a no-name college on my resume. But, against the odds...I actually got an offer for a company whose work I find far more interesting, in a city I find far more appealing to live in, for a salary almost double what I'm currently making. It's honest to god a dream come true for me, and something I honestly credit mostly to luck.\n\nThe problem is, I've only been working at my current company since January. I feel an immense sense of guilt that I'll be leaving them so soon; what's the best way to make sure I can leave the company on good terms? I'm set to start this new job in July, so I thought I'd give a 4 weeks' notice instead of the usual 2 weeks for the sake of courtesy.",

I started programming last year and racked up exactly 240 hours in JS and a little HTML & CSS before I stopped for my last semester of college. I spent 4-6 hours a day during last summer but now my parents are forcing me out and I'm working full time to support myself. Because of this, I can only find the energy to do about 2-3 hours of programming a day.\n\nMy plan was to continue working and programming for about 2-3 hours per day (which would give me a max of 711 more programming hours by the end of the year assuming the unlikely that I'll both never miss a day and always do 3 hours instead of 2). Then, by either January 2022 or August 2022, I'm focusing ENTIRELY on programming. I will take a work break offer from my job for about 3 or 4 months. \n\nMy question is this: \n\nShould I use that work break to just focus on self-study and finally getting around to building projects? Or should I use that time to go to code bootcamp? Or should I say forget the work break and just go to bootcamp part-time and do code part time?\n\nMy fear is that without a bootcamp education and without a CS degree, I will never be able to compete with those who went to bootcamp and definitely not with those with a CS degree. But I also fear that by going to bootcamp, I could potentially be just wasting $20,000 on stuff that it is possible to learn on my own.

        "title": "Need help in finding out the next steps of my career",
        "body": "Hi all, I'm in really need for advice, so I hope it's OK to post this here.\n\nI'm a back-end developer with 7 years in exp. I worked in several companies, mostly doing APIs and dealing with dbs. I have a bachelors in Software Engineering + business, so it's like a weird combination and it lacks some areas of a \"traditional\" CS degree. I have also experience with working with front-end, although my skills are not at the same level of back-end, but I can pretty much find my ways of doing stuff in Typescript/Angular. I also deal with \"Ops\" stuff, like CI builds, Docker/K8s/Helm, but again, not an expert. I can prepare images and all the like but I'm not a infrastructure/network/security expert.\n\nAnyway I'm currently in a job which the tech stack is modern and it's the only reason why I wake up everyday and go to work. The team is awful. Management is awful. It's this culture of blaming when things go wrong, no support and I'd even go and say a bit of 'tech bros' culture. Another thing that is bothering me is I get these huge tasks, not even a high level specification, just a \"wish\" of what they want. I try to make meetings, to find out what is it that they want, most of the time the meeting gets hijacked by one of them (the tech bros) arguing about something that we'll not need in 10 years. Then  I have to work my ass off to do things, then when I present my ideas or what I came up with they say oh but that's not it, or let's change this.. so the task that should be 2 weeks becomes months, just bcs I have no way to know what they want. Make no mistake, I don't work 2 weeks without talking about it, I post on our chats, i create documentation, diagram. But nobody seem to care and they only care later on. Frustrates the hell out of me.\n\nSo this has been going for over 2 years now. Recently I decided to start looking around for jobs and I found out this one which looks very interesting but it's completely out of my comfort zone. The tech stack is different from the ones I work with, and not only that, it's a different domain, I'll be developing let's say tools for other devs.  I already had an interview with them and will be having a second one, so I guess they liked me. It was very technical, about the tech stack I work now, and there was some other general questions. I liked the interviewer, it was fair and felt more like a good conversation.\n\nSo, now I'm wondering what should I do. I'm kinda getting scared of jumping and then finding out it was too much to handle. I stalked some ppl there and they all seem super smart and working with like 3, 4 different languages, doing all sort of different things and I'm here like: Why they are even considering me? I only know 1 language \"well\" + front-end but not that deep.\n\nI kinda understand that if they decide to offer me the job, it's because they believe in my skills and my past track tells that given challenges and new things I have always overcome them. I'm excited about it and I think it will be great for me as a professional to broaden my skills but the imposter in me is telling me that this is TO much and I'm panicking a bit :).\n\nSo I guess what I'm after with this post is: What you think about moving to a job where you don't have much exp with the tech stack? What things could I ask during the interview to assess if they are really aware of the fact that I lack knowledge and also if I will be given the time/support to ramp up and become a productive member of the team? I'm aware of my fears and the shitty imposter syndrome holding me, but I'm afraid of jumping in, then been given tasks where I have no idea what to do and then not get support, specially now with Covid and prob not meeting the team IRL for some months. In the other hand it's not like it's raining cool jobs, so I'm also worried of moving then being fired or not liking it, and have lost what I have today. I have my savings and would be ok without a job for months but I would prefer not to be in that situation.\n\nSorry for the long post and thanks in advance :)",

My dad makes six dollars less than me with fifteen years of experience (we live in NYC so that is really not enough to live off alone haha). So I dunno man.

This will be my fourth technical internship on top of other extracurriculars and hardships I faced (my grandfather died from COVID. also, poor grades lol), so I'm very happy, but do feel a twinge of \"something.\"\n\nI think I just want to give back to my family honestly. They're not bad people (well, my mom treats my dad as a ranting bag thoe). Only thing is that my dad is extremely tired and overworked for what he's paid, and both my parents don't clean up after themselves. Security guard work isn't necessarily hard but during the pandemic, my dad would say things like, \"If we die, we die,\" which implies that he doesn't think much of his life. Not sure what to really think or if I can even help him change that.\n\nPoint is, coming from a low income family to having pretty decent wages is like, mind blowing. I have such a hard time spending money because I'm used to not having much haha.\n\nEdit: The question is poorly written. I meant to ask if any other CS interns are making more money than their parents OR are advancing a lot from previously being low income - and are feeling weird about it.",

I'm not arguing that engineers would be better at coming up with product ideas and the general direction, but I do think that some people are naturally good at ideas and strategies.\n\nWhich is weird because these types of personalities are generally the engineers at a company. And the execs tend to be more like salesmen or managers grandfathered into their high status role.\n\nIdeas people should be execs. Not managerial people. These are two very different types of people. One type is good at managing others, details, facts, schedules. The other is good at big picture, creative, potentially a bit disorganized, and abstract thinkers.\n\nYet every exec I talked to so far is just a glorified manager. And their ideas are (no offense) usually pretty bad. I've seen great products get shafted by terrible ideas piled on top of it by people who have no understanding of what a good idea or bad idea looks like. And you can see this in almost every big tech company.\n\nWant a great example? Activision Blizzard. It's clear the higher ups are not interested in making good games or they don't understand game systems. They are so out of touch with the product that it just seems like the perfect example of this. It happens on a smaller scale at every tech company. And it makes me wonder why these people even need to exist. These execs remind me of DeeDee from Dexter's lab. They just run in and start pressing buttons and turning jobs and making noise hoping that they do something good and can take all the credit for it.",

But I have looked, and didn't find any problems I would want to solve with programming, in fact, I want to depend on apps and smart devices as little as possible.\n\nI believe most programs solve problems we don't have, until the media and marketing convinces us otherwise.\n\nBut I don't want to give up, since I like programming, and it still seems like a better career option for me than anything else.\n\n**I just don't want to work on stuff I don't believe in.**\n\nHonestly though, if I had enough money already, I wouldn't spend a day in front of a computer.\n\nBased on this, any advice how to find/identify subjects I could dive into, other than programming, in order to solve problems that I believe will make a difference? - what one believes in is subjective, but still.\n\nTo give me some ideas, what are examples of domain knowledge in programming, and could you recommend books for it?",

        "body": "So I'm just at the start of my journey, a few years out of college, but I'm finding myself failing to find any resemblence of a work-life balance at yet another job. I've worked as a programmer thrice so far and every single time, I'm facing the same problem - I cannot wrap my head around how to structure my days to still have a life. I've tried going corporate, I've tried smaller companies but the overarching problem remains the same.\n\nIn order to get to office at 9AM-ish, I wake up around 7:40 as my commute takes up around 40 mins in the morning and anything in the realm of 40min-70min in the evening depending on the traffic and accidents on the way back. So after I get out at 5PM, I'm home around 6PM, eat dinner and start my life around 6:40PM or so. In order to be able to live the next day, I have to go to bed around midnight, having prepared myself and sandwiches for breakfast and for work beforehand. \n\nThis realistically leaves me with 4 hours between 7PM and 11PM which does not sound _that terrible_ on paper but in reality, after work I'm so exhausted that these hours couldn't be further from any \"quality\" me-time. I feel like my brain is fried - both from having to _pretend_ to work for a large part of the past 8 hours (which I'm sure many people working corporate can relate to - though now working at a smaller company, I feel like the problem remains largely the same), and from the lack of fresh air and/or human interaction during that time (I'm an outgoing person and I crave human interactions but at my previous jobs, the interaction was literally three sentences exchanged at the watercooler a day; now at this new job, it's the same thing - the guys I'm seated with in the room literally don't say _a word_ apart from \"Hi\" and \"Bye\" the whole 8 hours - and believe me I've tried to have them talking but having felt like I was conducting an interview again and again, I just stopped pushing). Also, I'm so appalled by any digital media after sitting 8hrs in front of a screen that the things I would normally do to unwind (watch YouTube, watch a movie, play games) are completely off the table as my eyes are dead and I can't even focus on those things. I feel both physically and mentally done and it takes me a good two hours to be able to do any focused, quality activity for the remaining two. \n\nIn my previous jobs, this escalated so much that I'd gained like 15kgs over my year of working there, neglected basically all my hobbies and hated every hour of my life both on the week days (because of having no quality time outside of work) and on the weekends (because I wanted to cram so many things that I wasn't able to do during the week over those 48hrs that I was constantly stressed and frustrated that I could not). I did learn some lessons from that job and applied them now (like preparing meals in advance, forcing myself to sleep right etc) but honestly, the effect of those seems pretty negligible in the big picture.\n\nSo now I feel like I'm starting to fall into the same cycle again and I don't want to allow it to spiral as much as the last time. How do people still have a life while working full time? Having hobbies, friends and relationships, running freaking marathons? I do have all those things but am never able to sustain them when working full time. Even now I can see that my running schedule starts to fall apart again, I'm playing instruments 1 day a week instead of the usual 6 and so on. Despite rigorously sleeping 7h+ nights now, still the thing I'd love to do the most is just go and have a nap (which I'm forcing myself not to as it disregulates night sleep afterwards when done that late in the day). Is it the nature of working in CS and if you're not temperamentally compatible with being silent and alone for 95% of the day then you're not going to fit in? What am I doing wrong? Do you have any tips, personal accounts?",

Her college is unknown to pretty much everybody in the U.S.\n3. She doesn't have any full time work experience in the U.S. as a programmer at a well known company.\n4.

I reversed searched the hiring manager's github profile picture and his account on a furry website came up. I felt a weird vibe when I was talking to him during the hiring process and I guess this could explain it.\n\nCompany B is fully remote, pays well, and the product is pretty cool. I spoke to the team and they were all socially awkward and it felt like a bunch people who were bullied in grade school were put into one room. I also spoke to the software director and he had ZERO social skills. He conducted reference checks and my old manager was asking me how the hell he became a director.\n\nCompany C pays really well and everything is fine, but I'm not that passionate about the product as the previous two companies.\n\nIf anybody was in a similar situation, how did you determine what to value? How important is social skills from your coworkers on a day-to-day basis?",

        "title": "Are my expectations as a future software engineer too much?",
        "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently a first year college student attending a pretty good Jesuit University in the north east of the US and I'm majoring in Computer Science. I intend on doing an accelerated program where I get my bachelors degree in computer science and masters degree in software engineering within 5 years. My bachelors tuition is practically completely covered with a full tuition scholarship, I am a commuter so I do not pay room and board, and my masters will hopefully be covered with a graduate assistantship of some sort. Therefore, I will likely be debt free by the end of my education.\n\nThat puts me in a great position of not being in any debt out of college with a bachelors and masters, as I also have fully financed a car that will hopefully last me the next 8-10 years. Therefore, the next step would be to move out of my parents' home and find somewhere to live. For years, my dream has actually been to live \"up in the sky\" in a highrise in a beautiful city, and many of the top tech cities in the country are ludicrously expensive to the point that software engineers may not be able to afford to live in them. Something that has been heavily weighing on my mind is the fact that I ultimately hope to move to Miami, Florida, in a high-rise condo (not apartment) ranging from $2000-$3000 per month, but from my research, it appears as if Miami is not a big tech city and the engineers/developers do not get paid as much as engineers in, say, the west coast. I'm at a loss because living in the west coast in a highrise in a city is nearly double or triple the cost of doing the same on the east coast, but the salaries are much higher over there. I'm unsure if this dream is unrealistic in my 20's, but I want to do anything I can to set myself up to make it happen. I've lived in a crammed house my entire life, and the idea of living in a cozy condo with beautiful views is peaceful to me. Additionally, I am in a relatively long-term relationship, and my girlfriend is on-board with the plan and going to school for registered nursing, however I am unsure if it would be wise to finance the condo together rather than pay for it myself. Any advice would be appreciated on anything!",

        "body": "I'm a Senior Software Engineer (just got the promotion) at a startup (2 years 8 months exp). We're a development team (6 members and expanding now) in Asia working on a Swedish project. I joined the company on August last year.  \nMy salary was ok but I got an offer from another company and I let know my CEO. Then he offered me more (almost twice as which I was getting at the company) and promoted me to Senior. Even before that both CEO and Team-Lead have mentioned to me that I'm exceeding their expectations and they're very happy about my performance. But I thought it was just something to keep me happy and keep tied to the company without any pay raise. But apparently, it wasn't.  \nAfter the promotion Team Lead contacted me and mentioned that I'm performing well and I can be his right-hand man hereafter and said that he'll assign some advanced stuff to me which he was working on but now he doesn't have much time to work on since the team is expanding. I was surprised since there's already another Senior (at least 2 years more exp than me) who has joined the company way before I joined. But anyway I felt so good he choose me over other seniors.   \nWhat worries me is the company is very flexible. We just have to complete 40 hours per week and for more hours we're getting OT. But now considering the pay (which is now way above the market) I don't need to work OT. But I'm not sure how to proceed with the new responsibilities. Any advice, tips would be greatly appreciated.  \n\n\n  \n**TLDR** : *Promoted to Senior Software Engineer and chosen as the right-hand man of the Team Lead, over 2 devs who joined the company way before me and have more experience. How can I impress the boss and do good for the promotion?*",

However, my national guard unit got surprised with a deployment that's going to be from Oct 2021 to around September of 2022. This means I won't be able to start PT school until Jan of 2023.  I will be honest and say it does have me down in the dumps since I applied specifically after being told this deployment wouldn't happen but now it is. \n\nNow since I will be spending a year in Kuwait doing basically nothing (and will have internet access most likely) I have been looking at what I can do to not make that year a waste of time. Looking at CS vs PT I noticed how much more upward mobility and flexibility there is in the CS career field compared to PT. Also not to mention not having to go to PT school for 3 years which means no income at all and maybe some debt even with the military paying for schooling. \n\nI have always liked computers and have built many systems, but I have zero experience with code. If I applied myself over the course of a year would I be able to become proficient enough in the an area of CS to possibly switch career fields and work my way up from an entry level position in the future? If so what path should I take to go from learning to applying what I learned to looking for a job? And of course is it even a good idea to think about changing careers when I have an acceptance letter in hand to PT?\n\nAny input is appreciated. Thanks everyone",

I would like to work in the robotics industry as a software engineer or research engineer. To get job opportunities in these competitive areas, I plan to get a Master's degree or Ph.D. in a related area. I recently have got an internship (almost equals to a part-time job) as a computer vision engineer, which attracts me so much. So, I am eager to get deeper into these areas.\n\nBecause of my broad interest and probably vague understanding of these domains, however, I have trouble with deciding whether I will major in Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science.\n\nThe same kinds of questions are already posted, but courses of CS and ME are a little bit different from ones in general. For your better understanding of my situation, I give a brief explanation about departments in my university.\n\nThe department of Mechanical Engineering in the university where I learn provides so many courses about mechanics (heat, fluid, material, mechanisms), control (classical & modern), and mechanical designs based on CAD, but not enough ones about robotics software, especially about the algorithm area. In lab classes, they deal with more heat systems like engines, less intelligent robots, deep learning, or software (not zero).\n\nThe department of Computer Science provides a deep understanding of computer systems, algorithms, low-level programming, machine learning, compiler, and logic. Especially, since I like low-level programming and computer system, these kinds of classes strongly attract me. However, they learn nothing about engineering concepts such as control, signal processing, and robotics algorithms. In addition, they learn mathematics from so theoretical point of view, which does not seem to fit me. I like math, especially optimization and geometry, but classes like \"definition -> proof -> definition -> proof -> ...\" are boring for me. Historically, CS in my university derived from Math and belongs to the School of Science, not to the School of Engineering, so it is natural that professors studying pure discrete mathematics and pure logic in CS. In my view, though a CS degree is said to be good for jobs related to software, it is not necessarily true for robotics software.\n\nIn summary, it is a problem like \"Hardware side with so much mechanics and design or Software side with computer systems and a little bit too theoretical mathematics\".\n\nI hope to get some advice from those who are related to the robotics industry or academia.\n\nThanks for reading and answering, in advance.",

At this point I am extremely torn as to whether I should switch to computer science or should remain in computer engineering.\n\nReasons why I would switch to computer science:\n\n\\- Shorter Path to graduate\n\n\\- I am way more interested in the coding aspect of the major\n\n\\- I am afraid I may not be able to pick up the programming aspects without the instruction of proper CSC classes as I have way more EE requirements than CSC requirements. Like I literally take a handful of CSC classes and a bunch of EE ones.\n\nReasons why I would stay in CPE:\n\n\\- My school is well known for its engineering program and its engineering program is way more acclaimed than its computer science program\n\n\\- I can learn coding on my own\n\n\\- I will graduate with a bachelors in engineering\n\n\\- I will have a more versatile skillset if I can master coding outside of instruction and also pick up on the engineering concepts discussed in my classes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm tired of being so indecisive and I am afraid I'm wasting time. Like last semester I fully intended on switching to CSC and even wasted a lot of time by taking CHEM104 which I didn't need to take for engineering. I'm also afraid I will regret my decision. This semester I told my advisor that I am deciding to stay in engineering and i enrolled in classes that meet the engineering pre-requisites like Physics, Switching Systems, and Circuits. I have no idea what I want to do man. I was wondering if anyone on this thread can give their two cents that may help me make my decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. In my first 2 years I got the overlapping pre-requisites of both majors. Whatever I decide now will stand. ",

You hear a lot of horror stories about the industry, so I was hoping to hear from people who have actually worked in game dev to see what it really looks like. It seems like you generally make less working in games than you would elsewhere, but that's not super important to me. Is it possible to get to the mid 100's range at the senior level? Are there a lot of opportunities for remote work?\n\nSecondarily, what can I do to improve my chances of getting into the field?

I think the learning security part would be cool as well, but worried about the work potentially becoming routine after a couple of years.  Second is a consulting company.  It would be a salaried position - B2B job, where the company contracts with a larger organization, goes onsite with the consulting companies staff members, spins up the project from the entire lifecycle and leaves.  The contracts would usually take  6 months to a few years to complete.  Both are backend heavy.    \n\nI'm leaning towards consulting mostly because of the variety.

During that time I had a bunch of managers, but my last one hated me from the get-go for some reason and my life a living hell. Right before the pandemic he called me all sorts of names, I went to his skip level, huge mess. I was ready to get out, and then the pandemic hit and suddenly jobs were hard to come by.\n\nThen with the pandemic the company laid off 1/2 of their staff and it ruined what was left of the culture. Nobody trusted each other, everyone talked shit behind everyone's back, micromanagement, people constantly getting yelled at, coworkers that were friends turning on each other. It basically got to the point where I opened my laptop and wondered \"how am I going to get yelled at today?\"\n\nLong story short, I left that nightmare and started a new remote job. People from my old job are stalking my LinkedIn. I even had someone who still works there who I once considered a friend email me, tell me my boss talked shit on me for over 2 years in 1 on 1's (and still does), and that I was replaced by my boss's friend. I don't need old gossip in my life (and not sure what the point is to even rub my nose in this shit), so needless to say we don't speak anymore.\n\nSo long story short, after years of emotional abuse in the workplace I am having a bit of a hard time trusting my new coworkers. I keep waiting for my new boss to jump down my throat, or my coworkers to gossip about me, even though there's no inclination that either will happen. After years of passive aggressive code reviews, I'm trying not to project that tone on new people, but I can't help it. \n\nOther than good old therapy, do you have any work-place related tips on how to mentally \"start fresh\" with a new group of people?

        "title": "Really need advice on whether or not to change jobs (really really LONG story)",
        "body": "Warning: Long Wall(s) of text\n\nI'll start by describing where I am now: I have 5 years experience. I have agreed via email to take a new job and have been sent the final contract to sign. I was sent the final contract yesterday. I have not signed it.\n\nNow, for a lot of background: Last September I was in the interview process with this same company. It is quite a big company, probably top 5 in my country (Asian). I initially reached out to them to apply. I got the offer, however, I turned them down because the salary increase wasn't really that much for jumping jobs, about a 20% increase. I do like my current job (100% WFH, this new one is not) so it wasn't worth it.\n\nSoon after I turned them down, my project at my current job ended due to unforeseen reasons. So in December I reached out to them and asked if the role was still available, they said no, but they will let me know next spring if/when they have openings. So they did. I got an email in March. By  this time I still didn't actually have a project at work, basically having done nothing for 5 months. So I said yes. I tried to negotiate a few things with them but they would not budge on anything--no extra vacation days, not a single extra dollar in salary. Nothing. But whatever, I really wanted this job. I went through 1 more in-person interview with them. They did wonder why I was interested in the job again since I initially turned them down and I just told them the truth.\n\nThings took some time, and I finally agreed to the official offer letter in mid April. \\*\\*2 big differences\\*\\* comparing this offer and the one from last year--this is a 2 year contract offer, and last year's was permanent employment. This one also gives me a 28% raise compared to 20% last time. I wasn't thrilled about just a 2 yr contract, but well whatever.\n\n Then holy shit, literally the day I was set to tell my current job that I will be leaving at the end of May--I got a raise. Out of nowhere. I never asked for it or hinted to anyone. A 25% raise. When I got the initial email from my director, I thought I was getting fired. Now the 2 salaries are nearly identical--just a 3% difference between them. I did not tell the new job though, because I didn't want them to feel like I was stringing them along, especially since I turned down their offer last year. Then \\*after\\* that, \\*I\\* reached back out to them. So I said to myself, \"ok fine. You really have to just accept this. Very bad timing, but that's life. Stay true to your word, you accepted so it's the right thing to do.\" So I told my current job I will be resigning at the end of May, and I refused their raise. Now our 2 companies HRs are talking to get all visa stuff worked out for visa transfer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo then yesterday I finally got the final contract. And there are some things that are different, or were not included in the initial offer. For example, there is no mention of my bonus. Also the contract states that employees are not allowed to discuss salaries with anyone besides management. And it says something I (unfortunately) overlooked initially--the company can, at their sole discretion, extend the probation period indefinitely. It also states (not included in original contract) that in the event of termination, they can give me payment in lieu of advance notice. This is pretty bad for me because I am an international employee, so if I get fired my visa expires and I have 1 week maximum to pack all my stuff and leave the country--a country where I have mostly built my life the last 5 years.\n\nSo honestly at this point I just feel like this company is extremely stiff and rigid. In our first round of salary negotiations last year, they refused to budge at all. Then again during March they also refused to grant me a single thing I requested--they just said \"XYZ is standard for our international employees, we can't change it.\" It really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. And now, finally I get the final contract and my bonus is written out. I requested that they remove  their ability to extend the probation period, and they once again said they cannot remove that language, it is standard in all contracts.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from just refusing to sign is I want to keep my reputation. I feel like going back on them a 2nd time will destroy my local reputation and recruiters that they or others may know will think badly of me, and news will get around. Other than that, honestly, a 3% salary raise is not at all worth all this hassle. \n\nShould I try to stay at my current job (I am about 90% sure they would let me stay), or just suck up the missteps I've already made?

        "body": "Hey everyone. Just for context, I'm a man and come from an ethnic minority, outside the US.\n\nI started programming shortly after College around 7 years ago, doing Java during my first job. Projects were boring all the time (desktop apps), and I was interested in doing web dev, so I decided to apply to a Frontend position and got hired in 2015 in a digital agency, where I've had the chance to work on a variety of projects using several of the most popular JS frameworks. It was there where I really learned the software development cycle, versioning, testing, among other stuff.\n\nThe first two years I used to engage in long learning curves whenever I started a new project (we do mostly outsourced maintenance of existing projects). I would spend hours reading documentation, testing, googling, and debugging during ramp-up phases. And I kinda hoped this curve would get shorter with time as I got more experienced. But the truth is that it never did.\n\nBecause of how diverse and complex FE projects can be technology-wise, every time that I have to switch to a new team or project, I feel like I am starting from scratch. Like day 1. There can be a new framework with hundreds of new dependencies that I've never seen in my life or a strange integration of js libraries that somehow somebody managed to put together to build a set of web forms that could've been easily implemented in a different approach.\n\nAnd it's so frustrating because I have to be asking tons of questions all the time, onboarding sessions are never enough and mentorship is nonexistent most of the time. I get stuck easily and it takes me forever to catch up. At a personal level, it makes me feel constantly incompetent and forever inexperienced until eventually, I manage to fully understand everything.\n\nI know code maintenance can be hell. And I know every project and every company is different. But in my case, I haven't had the luck to grow as much as I wanted during these years as a FE developer. Maybe maintenance doesn't make you grow as much. Maybe FE is actually a huge mess. Or maybe I have the wrong impression of how experience translates into learning curve times. But the truth is that it can be very overwhelming.\n\nHas anybody here gone through something similar?\n\nAny tips to speed up learning curves?\n\nThank you",

Working with senior dev who drives good engineers away and management has no intention to address it. Should I quit and focus on my mental health and interviewing? Or will that hurt my second job hunt a lot \ud83e\udd14 \n\nHi all. I\u2019ve been in my first engineering job for about 10 months and I\u2019ve been seriously contemplating quitting for about a month. It started off as a good experience because I had a great senior engineer mentor on my team but once she left I realized that she shielded me from working with the senior developer who everyone dislikes. She left during a reorg where both my supportive manager and coworkers that I like got moved to a different team and I was left working with people who are all doing their own things. The senior developer is the only one I get to work with and his code is bad, the whole team depends on him, and I got stuck doing shit work for months (moving an app to production) so I basically just spend all day trying to get his code to run on my computer and he\u2019s constantly changing it so I have to constantly meet with him. All of the code stuff I\u2019m doing is shitty configuration stuff and it\u2019s never ending. I\u2019m not learning or building and everyday I have to say \u201cstill working on the same thing\u201d in scrum. The senior dev is not friendly, very condescending, mansplained the terminal to me, and basically just does what he wants since he\u2019s been here forever. Adding on to all of that, I started my first job during the pandemic and throughout everything that\u2019s been going on with BLM, Stop asian hate, etc. no one on my team talks about what\u2019s going on. Add on to that that I\u2019m the only woman of color on a team of 20 men and I\u2019ve started hating and resenting my job to the point where I have crying breakdowns everyday. I\u2019ve also expressed my frustrations to my manager months ago and asked to get put on a different project but nothing has happened. I hate the company culture and a bunch of people have left my team as well. I\u2019ve given up on pushing for change here and I\u2019ve started job hunting. I\u2019m trying to hold out longer but part of me is wondering if I should just quit and focus on my mental health and interviewing. I have about 3-4 months of savings saved up as well. I\u2019m mostly concerned about losing negotiating power or having to job hunt/explain my situation in interviews. I\u2019m also concerned about not having my first job tenure be a whole year & the idea of potentially not finding a job for months. Any thoughts? I\u2019m trying to hold out but my mental health is worse than it\u2019s ever been. \n\nAdvice would be much appreciated especially from people who have found a second eng job during Covid!",

        "body": "I've been feeling increasingly uneasy about my career as I go over my mid thirties. I don't think I'll ever enjoy managing people just to manage, but I do enjoy being a team leader and staying technical. Over the past 2 years I've been shadowing local dentists (9 month gap during pandemic) and really enjoyed it. I'm thinking of using my savings to fund my way through dental school, as the older dentists I shadowed had extreme work life balance, high salary, and job stability. They all typical work 32 hours over 4 days, no call, rare emergency overtime, and seem to get more desirable with age.\n\nThe cs folks I work with over 40 tend to take 2 paths. The lucky successful ones (10% of people or less) get m7 mbas and move into the upper echelons, making great money with terrible hours. The remaining 90% of people on my path tend to settle into middle management, face lay offs, lack autonomy, face wage stagnation, and generally seem unhappy.\n\nI applied to a competitive pre dental program with over 90% acceptance rate to dental schools but I'm getting cold feet as everyone I know is telling me it's not worth it (5 years long, 300k tuition plus lost wage). I'm also worried in the future dentistry will go cities l corporate and I'll be a slave to production.\n\nAm I wrong in thinking ageism will hurt me in my current career without a masters degree? Am I looking at dentistry with rose tinted glasses? Any older math/cs folks regret staying in the career after 40?",

I like money.\n\n2. Fashion isn't exciting and there's no room for meaningful innovation. Besides which consumers are simply not interested in fashion, like yeah sure everyone wants a Louis Vuitton or whatever but there's no value for craftsmanship or design, only 'hype'. The pandemic has forced the industry into an existential crisis and it seems like a sinking ship to me.\n\n3. I want to be part of a meaningful community that doesn't have its head up it's a\\*\\*, tech/coding/UX/UI seems like a nice bunch of people... but I don't know that yet.\n\n5. I don't want to live in NY/Cali.\n\nI know people keep saying it's a trendy field and everyone is career-hopping into it but nonetheless, I have a few questions:\n\n\n1. Is it worth it? Will it stay relevant? Is the money good? Is the work culture good (or at least not as toxic as fashion)?\n\n2. Do I need another degree? I would rather not get another degree or Bootcamp. I'd rather be self-taught or a certificate. Is that a legitimate route to go or will I be wasting my time?\n\n3. Are there any transferable skills between Fashion Design and software? I can make tech packs and spec sheets, 3D model a dress, draft patterns and textile prints, cut and sew a garment and photograph to sell.. but how do these skills transfer to something like software development? \n\n4. What does it take to get a well-paying job? The people I know in software keep boasting about 110k straight out of college, now that's rare obliviously, what kind of starting salary is reasonable and how does it scale with experience?",

        "body": "Hey everyone. I'm a (formerly) lead developer based in the Rust Belt. Have about 12 years experience, skill wise I have had my hands all over the place. My last company went belly up due to the pandemic and earlier this year I started interviewing.\n\nWith remote jobs popping off, a whole new world was opened up for me with job opportunities. I got 5 offers since January. Some gave me close or near my low Rust Belt salary, or the benefits weren't great so I turned them down. Then I got an offer from a mid sized West Coast company (remote).\n\nThe job was for a mid level developer role and their salary was amazing for me, so I took it. But then I took the job and found out that the job itself is way beneath me skills wise.... and I haven't even wrote a single line of code in the 2 months I've been there. So here are my pros and cons:\n\nCons:\n\n- Haven't wrote any code, worried I will stagnate skills wise over time.\n\n- They mislead me, so not exactly hyped about that\n\n- Company is going through a transitionary period, a good number of people have left and been backfilled\n\nPros:\n\n- Pay is WAY more than I can get locally. For reference my friend works in my city as a senior dev and gets $40k less than I do for a tough dev job, while I tweak XML files and other easy stuff. Pay is also more than I got with other remote offers\n\n- Great benefits (unlimited PTO with 20 days minimum encouraged, employee perks, don't have to commute)\n\n- I like my coworkers and they like me\n\n- Low stress. No micromanagement, no one cares what schedule you work, job is a breeze, no panic attacks come deadline time. And best of all, NO DAILY STANDUPS OR SCRUM SHIT!!!\n\nSo I am thinking about just sticking it out for a year. After all the mental stress put on by the pandemic, I feel like I could use a year to work a low stress job and remove myself from the rat race, at least for awhile. However, I am worried that I will stagnate and not interview well in a year. I have no problem getting offers now, and I figure that down the line I can work on my Github and stuff again and get back up to speed.\n\nWhat do you think? Is it worth the risk this far into my career?",

I have zero experience in the entire field, I have zero experience in tech in general.  I used to be a chef for a living. I was hired after I finished a coding bootcamp. \n\nThis is my first tech job and the company is aware of this. I have had 6 1on1s with my boss but I feel like I'm not asking the appropriate questions. He hasn't mentioned anything about it but I feel like I'm going to be expected to ask the job related questions now but I fear I still don't really know what it is I'm supposed to be doing. I was told to learn the test automation and be able to do the automation for when we do production release and I've attempted it but I always end up making the test fail and communication with the people in charge of this hasn't really been available and to boot, i think one of the two is on vacation or sick leave at the moment. I'm expected to do a run next Friday.\n\nI've been tasked to learn and I update on my learning. I went to a bootcamp and learned the MERN stack but this company deals with their own proprietary stack so every time I try to learn something I just say .. \"well I learned this and I can see the similarity of this with what is being used in our codebase\" and it seems to be a reasonable explanation to my inability to understand the code thoroughly but I don't know how much longer I can explain that way. \n\nI feel like there's  not much mentorship but I don't know if a month and a half is what they expect to be enough to start on asking more work specific questions and not finding similarities on what I was learning and the codebase that exists already.\n\nSo to my question, what sort of questions can I ask my manager to communicate that I want to be able to understand the codebase but I need some more guidance than what I am receiving now? Basically like 1 to 2 people talking to me a per week and tell me to update my access requests and they will connect with me again later when that's done. When I do get pass that they are busy and can't talk to me again and I'm just left to watching pluralsight videos all day. I'm not complaining, I just feel like I'm still not really learning what I need to learn specifically related to the job and that they will think I will not be good enough for this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the rant.

It isn't cutting it for my development.\n\nI'm not in a situation where I must learn Java or I'll get fired, but my motivation to learn it is just not there so I am polling the room on how I can improve my circumstance.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Are there jobs out there that are front-end exclusive that pay $90k+? (My preferred salary - I believe my skills are strong enough to warrant this, but please sound off if you think this is high for my expectations - also NYC area preferably remote). \n\n1a.

I've been trying to get internship in sophomore year but during Covid a lot of companies canceled the internships so there wasn't any luck.\n\nCollege wasn't exactly helpful because they had to deal with more than half students who didn't manage to find an internship. \n\nManaged to get accepted to the internship but the found out that it's isn't suitable for college requirements. \n\nI'm mostly good at Java and React Native.

        "body": "Whenever I apply for startups, I typically only look at startups with Series A funding or above to filter out seed startups.  What I realized is that regardless of funding, it does not stop them from having the most unpredictable hiring practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne startup promised me they would consider me for fully remote and that location is not issue for them.  Well, the boomer cofounders decided that they will not be a WFH company, and that they want people in the office at least 4 days a week in the Bay Area.  I decided no thanks, and withdrew my application.\n\n\n\n\n\n6 months ago, I applied for a backend engineering position at one startup.  The recruiter interview went well, then started talking with the hiring manager.  He literally told me that he has zero intention of hiring me for the role in the first minute of the interview, and asked me if I would be willing to interview with them a few months into the future when data-related roles open up.  6 months later, the only job postings this company has is a few account manager jobs.\n\n\n\n\nAnother startup had a lengthy technical interview process.  I did great, but they rejected me because of \"lack of fit\".  Whatever that means, but I typically do well with other companies that have more behavioral interviews.\n\n\n\nWith these hiring practices, it seems like startups will never be able to compete with bigger companies in terms of hiring talent.  There is a lot of people who are willing to work at startups if it meant not doing hundreds of leetcode problems.  I personally would take a very small paycut at my next job if this was possible and if I could work on interesting projects.\n\n\n\n\nStartups with old-fashioned views of WFH will never attract quality engineers if they can't offer WFH to their engineers when they are paying below market value.\n\n\n\n\n\nStartups have the opportunity to attract a lot of talent, but their hiring practices prevent it.",

I graduated med school last year and will be finishing my first year of residency this summer.\n\nI don't love medicine and the specialty I chose is not going to set me up with a ton of opportunities.  The job market outlook right now is - \"if you're open to moving almost anywhere in the country you'll find a job.  If not, do a 2nd or 3rd fellowship\".  Chances are I'll also be restricted to academia and its salaries.  I'll be making ~60k for the next 3 years and will probably be looking at 150k-200k in 4-5 years, then low 200s several years after that.   Certainly not something to scoff at, but also not the \"doctor money\" some people expect.  Medicine also comes with insurance that will cut into my salary.\n\nI have become increasingly interested in technology and computer programming over the past 5 years.  So much so that I'm considering leaving to become a software engineer.\n\nWould this be absolutely insane?  It wouldn't take much to beat my work satisfaction right now and I already sit in front of a computer all day.\n\nI think my main concerns about making the switch are my ability to make a salary in the same ballpark while having similar benefits (4-6 weeks paid vacation, health insurance) and not being too late to the game to be able to succeed and move up the career ladder.  I'm in my early 30s.\n\nConcerns about staying in medicine are my relative lack of opportunities, the need to move several times in the next several years, and the fact that I just don't like it all that much anymore.   Switching specialities could fix some of this but I think I'd like software engineering more than I'd like any other specialty.\n\nThanks!",

They were very pleased with my performance and proceeded to raise me to $10/hr that same year. Following the same path, after my 2018 review, they raised me to $15/hr which I was very grateful for.\n\nDuring most of that period, I was working part-time due to focusing on getting my GED. After I obtained my GED, my boss and the senior dev were heavily encouraging me to get a two year degree. So, I was able to obtain a scholarship and started my degree program in 2019 and have recently graduated debt-free (with some obligations, but not to the employer). While obtaining the degree, I also worked part-time for the same company doing dev work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent situation:\n\nAfter graduation, my employer offered me just above $17/hr which I felt was a huge slap in the face. I countered with a substantial amount higher than what they offered (around \\~$33/hr) noting my near four years of experience in software with them and my new degree. The senior dev has given me high praises and says the quality of code I produce is better than he's seen from other senior devs.\n\nMy employer countered back saying my hours clocked only amounted to about 2.5 years experience so they were still considering me a junior dev thus the low-ball salary.

I graduated last year in August, and have been looking for jobs since September.\n\nFortunately, I was able to secure a few interviews in which I felt that I did well as an Entry Level candidate however, after a few days of each of them, I would wake up to rejection emails suggesting that I did not have enough work experience or, an email directly from the interviewer suggesting that they found a candidate who had at least 1-2 years of experience more than me. \n\nI did two internships during the summer after my sophomore and junior year (2nd went on for 6 months until Covid hit and I got laid off - FML) however, they had a hiring freeze throughout 2020 and I received a rejection that went along the lines of the context I mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\nThroughout the past few months, I've just been depressed after receiving countless rejections, however, I did prepare myself for it, as the times are very difficult due to covid, but the impact of rejections was inevitable as it took a toll on my mental health. \n\nThis past week, I gathered myself and have been putting in the maximum effort towards job search in hopes of success. I have been working in a startup part-time to maintain my visa status as I am an international student which I feel has provided me some valuable experience that I can now bring into my resume. \n\nYesterday, I was considering exploring different paths/fields with my Computer Science knowledge and experience such as Salesforce Development and Data Analysis but I am a little misguided in regards to them and would appreciate any guidance that anyone may have.\n\nI would also be grateful if you had any feedback or recommendations in regards to how I should up my game in job search and practicing interview questions on leetcode. I am a small Liberal Arts College grad who's looking for any sort of opportunity. Harsh feedback is welcome as well. Thank you for your time!\n\nTL;DR: 2020 Grad still unemployed seeking guidance in job search and exploring other paths.",

I don\u2019t want to be turned down because of my grades, that would exacerbate my impostor syndrome. \n\nMy GPA is around 2.3, but my interest in tech, is often much outside the classroom and grades. I would say I have a fair knowledge about tech, from the YouTube videos I watch. I know it is unlikely but should I contact the representative and talk or not do and skip it. Emailing the representative would help me better represent myself then my terrible GPA and transcript. I had re-done couple of classes, because I have failed them. And the pandemic put a major hit to my GPA. I want to capitalize on the very slim chance of trying for an internship. I wouldn\u2019t want my GPA to be the sole reason decision of my rejection\n\n-sorry for bad english",

        "body": "Hi Reddit, \nI wanted to get the opinion of more experienced individuals because I just got offer a job by a Fortune 100 company that has a salary of 80k, a 5k bonus and a 10k relocation bonus every 8 months, that I can use for whatever I like (it doesn't necessarily need to be used for moving expenses). I also get excellent benefits and healthcare. This offer sounds great except for the fact that it is a rotational program and it requires me to relocated to Kennesaw, GA first and then Charlotte, NC or Seattle, WA. The job is an application development in C++ and C#, or implement REST based APIs in a service-based architecture. This doesn\u2019t sound bad, but I currently work as a software engineer/(mobile developer) at a small company in Tampa, FL. I love my current job because I get to work as the main mobile developer/engineer which it amazing giving that is my first job and mobile development is the field that I always wanted to be in since before graduating from college. This job gives me a lot of freedom, so much that for the past 4 months I been working remotely from Puerto Rico and my boss is pretty easy going with how I organize my daily work schedule. Unfortunately, my currently salary is below average even for a job located in FL. My salary is 55k, but I have been living very comfortably because I don\u2019t need to pay rent in Puerto Rico and the cost of living here is significantly lower than in Tampa, FL. My dilemma is, should I take this new job offer and leave my current job? I made a cost analysis of all the expenses I would inquire if I accept this new job offer and my net gains after all expenses is only like $400 more than what I\u2019m currently making/saving on a monthly basis. All my family and friends are either in Puerto Rico or Tampa so GA would be apart from all of them and I not sure the extra money is worth moving apart from all of them, but I don\u2019t know if I should let this opportunity slip away since the salary is so high. Should I mention the offer to my current employer and ask if they would at least give me a 10k increase on my salary? I have only been working for my current employer for four months so I\u2019m relatively new. Also, is me not taking this job offer limiting my chances of getting an even higher salary in the future? Should I stick to mobile development if I'm enjoying it so much? What is the best course of action for someone in my position?",

The TC is pretty good for a Canadian new grad position and it is a company I would enjoy working for and has good learning and growth opportunities. \n\nHowever, the TC does not compare to that of high tier US tech companies, and is also less than that which the US offices for this company offers. I know people say cost-of-living is different but the Canadian office is located in one of the most expensive cities in North America (and I'm also 'meh' about the prospect of living there). Furthermore, I still have 1 year left before graduation and still have 1 more internship left to complete as part of my degree so I'm still quite ambitious on aiming for a better offer at a higher tier company -- which I believe is achievable given my recent internship experience at the company who gave me the FT offer.\n\nSo my question to ya'll is, would you simply decline the offer (the ethical choice) or accept the offer with the intent of reneging if something better comes along in that year before graduating? \n\nP.S.

I've been feeling very much like I needed to go elsewhere for a while but I haven't had a good push as the job pays OK and offers great benefits (but with 0 upward mobility).\n\nHowever, last week I had a medical incident and at this point I'm not sure if I'll be able to safely drive as much (if at all), even going up and down stairs can be a challenge. I'm on medical leave from work while waiting on specialists and referrals etc. but I'm coming from an IT job that involved a large amount of walking.

The one I see most advertised/recommended is App Authority, but there's literally no way to schedule a talk with admissions (which seems really suspicious). They claim you pay nothing upfront until you \"find a job\" making $50k+, but they don't specify that it's a software engineer job.

I want to take it, but my gut is telling me no. \n\nTo start off, I think the firm outsourced to India which isn't bad, but the recruiter or HR rep don't understand verbal english. So phone conversations go nowhere. The second red flag was when the recruiter lied about me getting the position and started asking for my social. I reached out straight to my interviewer and he said he didn't make a decision yet. Also when I asked the recruiter if I'd have insurance, can take time off, he said yes to all of it. Yet the paperwork from HR listed my position as a computer programmer (all docusign btw, no workday for onboarding) without insurance. \n\nI told them when I have proof from Walmart I got the position I'll fill out the paperwork. Finally this week a person who is english proficient reached out and sent an email screenshot of Walmart confirming to move forward with me. I reached out to the interviewer from Walmart to discuss long term career expectations to make sure this purely a 6 month contract and we chat tomorrow. \n\nSo I feel trapped between a rock and a hard place.

I have been a machinist for 5 years, minus 6 months where I was a tooling engineer before being demoted due to the pandemic. Shortly after I followed a coworker to a different company as it was made clear that my engineering position was being eliminated even after business picked up.\n\nI recently was reached out to by a friend who's small shop was looking for another manufacturing engineer. The place offered me the position with no raise (I am paid very well for a machinist, I produce excellent results), and the benefits are not as good seeing as it is a much smaller shop then the one I work at. However, the way I see it is that engineering experience will help my engineering career in the long run compared to more machining experience. (It's not really a field that can be peaked, but I feel like anything else I learn would only be useful if I stayed being a machinist).\n\nSo with that job offer in hand, I gave my notice at my current job. Immediately upon doing so I was told to talk to the plant manager and explain the situation. I did so, while explaining that the company had treated me excellently, and that I was not leaving due to an increase in pay but rather more suitable work experience.\n\nI was made a counter offer which will be given to me in writing on monday that states something to the following effect: I will become an associate manufacturing engineer, the company will reimburse the next 2 years of my tuition and upon completion I will be promoted to manufacturing engineer. However the duties of associate manufacturing engineer will not start for a few months while they free someone up to operate my machines.\n\nIn the machining/manufacturing world, it's completely normal for things to take a bit because skilled labor is hard to come by (especially now, given the current job market). I also did not find any reason to doubt the legitimacy of his want for me to fill this position. There is a lifetime employee/engineer retiring in a year or 2, and the other engineers have purchased tooling that has made me want to bang my head into a wall, causing real issues in the shop. I was a tooling engineer at one point, so there have been times I have told them things weren't going to work before even producing parts. (so far, I've won that argument every time after they try it anyways.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my question with that all out of the way is: should I consider the counter offer? I have always heard they are bad to accept. However I do enjoy my current company, I just want to start my engineering career and start to leave my machining one behind. If I were to accept the counter offer, what sorts of things should I look for in the written offer to be safe?",

I failed 3 classes just from avoidance and got withdrawn from the university and on top of that I went through a breakup and that was the cherry on top.\n\nI appealed late in the summer when I felt a bit better and I thought I couldn't tell anyone that that happened and they luckily let me back in. I miraculously went back and my financial aid was miraculously given back as well at the sympathy of a counselor. I started to feel better around the fall, and somehow luckily I got a job around December at a very reputable company for xx engineering with a great program. The thing is the mental health issues left me barely scraping by as I wasn't properly able to be productive and got basically all D's in all my classes which was fine for graduating I suppose, but I'm nearing the end of spring semester and the classes I have exams for I could cram and take, but my very very last cs class in circuitry was asynchronous and I basically didn't even look at it doing half the assignments, missed all quizzes and lab attendance grade, and the final is in a week. I'm confident in my ability to do well on the final tbh, but even then it looks like I won't be able to pass the class.\n\nMy job is set to start in mid June, and I don't think I'll ever be lucky enough to receive an offer as amazing as this job in the current job climate and in general. It's basically 100k salary w amazing benefits and opportunities at a top 50 company. I can't take this class in the summer as it's not offered either. I emailed the professor recently and he said he's a little sympathetic but unless I get a doctor's note for some assignments, he is being strict with all his deadlines and giving 0's a minute late grading policy. I really don't know what to do and I've heard of people taking jobs and not saying anything which tbh seems possible in this case, but I also am afraid of the risks of that backfiring and sorta disappointed having done the work for 2 majors and not getting a degree. I really haven't told anyone about this as my peers are so happy for me, but graduation is in a few weeks (luckily optional so I don't have to tell family) and it's eating at me inside. Only in the last few weeks I've started to get my shit together from the support of a few incredible supportive people to recover my other classes but this one class seems unsalvageable.\n\nWhat should I even do? My friends family and relatives are all expecting me to graduate with this job. Should I just start the job and not look back? Or do I tell my company, lose the opportunity, and take another semester in the fall to graduate (if my university even lets me attend again after failing so many classes). It's so stupid that I did this to myself especially when looking back all I had to do was the bare minimum, but I also can't forget how debilitating the shame and depression that I went through lead me here. If I start my job too, I think I'm really confident that I will do really well. I have no idea what to do I just need to hear opinions.",

        "body": "I'm a recent graduate from a CS program in Canada looking to land my first full-time job in software development. My problem mainly stems from the fact that I feel that I don't really have the skills that most companies are looking for due to some off-kilter experience.\n\nAs for why that is: I actually did a dual degree in Computer Science and Engineering Physics (EP first, then started CS in 3rd year). This was partially because EP has few job prospects unless you're going into research or are gung-ho about space (which I am not), and partially because I wanted to get an internship through the CS department's internship program (which worked out, thankfully). Throughout these degrees, my accumulated experience amounts to 3 summers of research writing data analysis code for radar and satellite data (with 2 papers published with co-author credits) and a 16-month internship writing image analysis code for a university group that was half research group and half startup company (its weird). As for projects, I was focused on my classes, so my projects mainly stem from them: a Python simulator to recreate the results of a networking paper, a mechanical device for rotating tiny samples in a vacuum chamber (for the EP degree's final-year project), and other small things that recruiters likely wouldn't care about like a dead-simple stepper motor driver.\n\nAs a result, I don't seem to mesh well with most entry-level software development positions. I don't have any web-dev experience, whether front, back, or full-stack (despite the image analysis code being made for a web-app; I just didn't write much non-analysis stuff for the backend codebase, which was mostly Python, Django, and an abuse of ElasticSearch as a database). Embedded and IOT stuff seem interesting to me, but they seem to require hardcore C/C++ experience that I don't have plus a bunch of other weird skills that I've not have encountered before. Cloud and database stuff is also interesting, but they similarly have high requirements that I can't really meet. It seems that all I could really do is data analysis, but I'd much rather be a software developer and not be pigeonholed into just analysis, even with substantial coding involved.\n\nAnd so, I haven't applied to as many places as I should have so far. I've gotten 1 interview, but only because a friend of a friend (/my supervisor for my internship) gave me a referral to a popular local company with Master's level AI people also applying to it. I just don't know what positions I qualify for or should apply to. I don't know how I can convince recruiters and companies that I could easily learn and do embedded, or cloud, or web development with what is largely analysis experience. I don't know how I can spin my mish-mash of experience into a full-time software development position.\n\n(And, for posterity, [my current resume](https://imgur.com/a/TSLvJWt), though critiques are not the point of this post compared to the worries I mentioned above.)",

        "body": "Ok so I know basically anyone in any field has had the same question, but I'm pretty new to the CS world (until very recently, I had planned to go to medical school), so I feel really behind a lot of my peers and I have no clue where to start. I'm going to be an undergrad junior in the fall, but I can't take upper levels til next winter because I only started CS coursework last Fall (premed freshman year). I have an internship with cybersecurity at a non-tech company (with a tech internship program)  this summer, but I got to final interview with a FAANG company earlier this year (but bombed it because I got a question on binary trees, at which point I hadn't even learned about pointers or linked lists). After that rejection, I kept looking for other positions but didn't hear back at all (so maybe the FAANG interview process was a fluke). Outside of classwork and a computational bio internship, I don't have any experience with software dev, and I have no clue what Dev/Ops or Full Stack or Front/Back end even means (though I think I could just google that lol). I just feel like a tiny fish in a huge pond.\n\nI know C++ a good amount (that's what my classes are taught in) and at my current job I use Python. I learned Java in high school and I can use R for statistical programming. What additional skills should I develop? Are there are any project ideas that I could take on over the summer (couple hours on weekends/after work)  that will make my resume stand out and my portfolio less barren? I want the internship search to be different next summer, and I want to go in feeling confident that I'll breeze past the initial resume reviews. If it matters, my CS gpa atm is pretty good, but I've heard gpa doesn't really matter for internships but I really don't know lol.",

        "body": "I have nowhere else to rant so I wanted to post here to get people's opinion. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this way knowing how lucky I am to have a job and a company that has treated me well but oh well.  Over the past 2-3 months, I've started to feel very upset and angry at my work due to small little things adding up to a point I can't just ignore and I want to share with everyone to see if anyone else has experienced these. I feel like I'm being a soft azz beach but I just can't tell why it upsets me so much.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. In our team calls where we are discussing new features and details, I feel like I don't get the chance to say what I want to say. One senior starts talking about something, UX jumps in to point flaws and then it just becomes a back and forth back and forth between these two with others jumping in and cutting each other off to speak and I'm just not like that. Ill politely raise my hand and wait until my manager calls but because these guys keep going back and forth and my manager doesn't shut them up, it gets to the end of the meeting and I either forgot what I wanted to say or no more time and the meeting ends with my opinions and thoughts not expressed. Like there have been times I wanna unmute and just yell \"CAN EVERYONE PLEASE SHUT UP AND LET ME SPEAK!\" but that's obviously unprofessional and I hate cutting people off mid conversation to assert my point. It happened several times and I just feel like nobody gives a shit about what I need to say. The seniors dominate the conversation and UX guy can't just shut the up for a God damn second and keeps pushing back while I sit there politely waiting for my turn. At the beginning I just ignored it and said it's fine but it happened so much that now I just feel like crying and feel useless to the company cause nobody apparently cares about what I want to say. The couple times I have had the chance to express my views regardless how dumb they are, I appreciated just being acknowledged and being told that it's not a good idea or it's a great idea. I'm not always right but I literally just want to be acknowledged and heard when I have something.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. One time some guy from another team was having trouble with something he was working on and it was connected to something I worked on before. I help him troubleshoot and spend my entire day looking beyond our code and into the packages we are using (went beyond our codebase, a deeper rooted issue). Once I found out why, I was excited since it took me the whole damn day. He's much more senior than I am so I was really excited to report to him the problem. Once I did, he was just like \"oh that's wrong it shouldn't be like that\" end of conversation. No thank you, no appreciation for debugging for him, no F'ING NOTHING! I was so deflated cause I literally could have denied to help him but because he's much more senior and has way more experience, I felt rude rejecting his request although I had my own work.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n 3. Manager assigned me a feature that I should work on. I was super excited and he helped give me get started. I start digging into it, researching it, spending my personal time outside work cause I was just that invested. Mid way through, he tells me he will look into it too. He ends up hijacking it and finishing it using some of the work I had done ... Again I felt upset. Why do all that when you were gonna end up working and finishing it. Wtf??? Was I taking too long? Could you have not just directed me to get it done the way you wanted?   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways these are some examples that come to mind and I've gotten to a point where I just drag myself to work. I can't tell if it's valid to feel upset and hurt cause the company has been otherwise treating me well and my manager most of the times is cool and understanding but I can't help understand why I'm so frustrated and upset when I do work. Everyone else in the company seems to be at harmony. Nobody else seems to have trouble with one another. Why do I feel the outlier? Why do I feel so upset and angry at people? I'm so confused .... I cannot reason my emotions. I shouldn't feel this way I have work at a time many people don't and I'm getting paid well but why am I so upset and frustrated with people??",

After two years of working as a project manager for a geotech consulting firm, I don\u2019t believe I want to do this for the rest of my life, and am thinking of making a career change to computer science. \n\nI should note that I have very minimal experience with Matlab and Python from my geology coursework using ArcGIS and other geospatial softwares.\n\nSince I already have a BS and 30k of student loan debt, I figured I should find some free online resources to try and learn coding/software development. Does anyone have any recommendations?\n\nAre there any coding/software certifications I could get outside of getting an actual computer science degree? My hope is that if I were to pursue this, a recruiter would see that although I have a degree in an unrelated field, if I could get certified in python, Matlab, or anything else I might need, it could give me a chance of making a career switch to computer science. It just seems like a waste to incur even more debt if I don\u2019t have to when I already have a BS. Does this matter?\n\nAny and all advice on where to get started would be greatly appreciated!\n\nTL;DR I have a BS in geology, looking to switch to computer science, need advice on free  resources to start learning the basics",

        "body": "I have a small LLC and I recently took on a 1099 job and I'm really enjoying the extra siding come in addition to my W-2 job. Initially I thought about getting another 1099 job because I have the bandwidth for it but then I feel like maybe I'm stretching myself too thin and going in the wrong direction. So another thought I had was to go on these sites that offer developers for hire and vet them myself and then turn around and apply for jobs that allow third party applicants. The developer would then be handed over as a consultant to work on the project for the client. There would be no project management on my side. They would simply be a supplemental resource added to a client project. I would build a higher hourly rate and take a cut off the top of it.\n\nWhat am I missing here? This sounds kind of easy especially since I can talk the lingo of tech because I am a developer. It feels like this would scale better than continuing to do 1099 work myself. I'm just not familiar with all of the processes and procedures of subcontracting a 1099 person to another client. it doesn't appear like there is a lot of information online about this from what I have seen.

        "body": "I work at a large firm, and the pay is decent, though about just over half of what my friends make. This is my first job, gonna complete an year next month, right out of university - I did my internship here too. I'm working in a split model, where I offer technical support, and handle tickets for the better part of three days, and then I develop tools to support this team in the remaining two. Most of my active development deals with AngularJS and Java 8/Spring.\n\nI wasn't interested in the support part at all, but I decided to continue with the job because I was afraid of the job market during the pandemic. I have continued to dislike it, but I have learnt how to better manage my time due to it. I also decided to think of it as the \"[eating my own dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)\".\n\nLately, I've gotten extremely frustrated because of the kind of code I'm exposed to. This team completely makes internal products, so we have next to no \"good code\". I have worked with better code than this in my second year of university. It ranges from ridiculous architectural designs, to unit tests that are written purely for the sake of it (think mocks an input and verifies that the input is mocked), and just zero handling of technical debt whatsoever.\n\nI have toyed with the idea of shifting to a different team that does work on consumer-facing products, considering I love the firm I'm at but that seems to be unlikely because our support team is currently in the middle of a resource crunch. What do I do now? Should I consider a new job? Has anyone else been in the same position here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'm also helping out interns who joined us this year. A common thing I've heard from the seniors is that \"its fine if they can't code well, its the easiest part of the job\". This has particularly irked me because I kinda agree with it, but this is clearly where the bad code stems from.",

Skip to the tldr for the relevant question in bold:\n\nApplied for a job I wasn't qualified for (by accident), surprisingly, they still wanted to interview me. \n\nI did well in the first interview, was asked to do a second one with the team I'd be working with. That also went well. \n\nHad a 15 minute zoom call with the hiring manager (from the first interview), he wants to hire me, but (as described above) I'm not qualified for the position I applied for, but he wants to hire me for a position that's being created currently (already submitted to hr, they're doing approval before its posted). Told me it SHOULD take 1-2 weeks, but knowing hr, make that a month. \n\nHe told me I might consider doing a temp position in the mean time, but only if Hr could guarantee a smooth transition to the full time position. After about a week, hr could not give him the assurances he wanted, so he took the temp thing off the table and said we'd wait for the full time position.\n\nGot an update friday, they're negotiating the salary with hr now. Got another update this morning: position passed the first step of the approval process, he expects the job to (hopefully) \"post\" this week. He'll then move my application to that newly created position where he'll then tell hr he wants to hire me for that position. \n\n**I then asked what step comes next. He said hr will do their vetting of me, then they'll formally extend me the offer. He said the vetting will be normal stuff like checking references and my education. I have the bachelor's degree in computer science that is required for this entry level position, but I'm worried about my gpa. While i didn't see anything about gpa requirements, my college gpa was pretty shit (under a 3.0) because I switched majors yata yata yata. I've heard from a friend who's a software engineer at an insurance company, that she's had people get hired by the hiring manager, and then upon hr reviewing their application, denied the hire because of their gpa. I don't know how typical that is though. Couple questions then. First, how common is it for people to check your gpa (rather than just verify that you do in fact possess the required degree). Of the 4-5 places i've gotten interviews with the last year (fuck covid man, so many places are in a hiring freeze, if not outright laying people off), only one has requested my transcripts. Obviously I didn't get that job. And my second question, how common is it for places to then reject you if your gpa isn't above a certain threshold? I mean its not like its beneath a 2.0 or anything. its just not above 3.0. If i were to just give them my gpa for the last 2.5 years (5 semester) when i formally switched majors to computer science, my gpa is a 3.06. I think that's a lot more relevant to my skills than to look at my long gpa history when I was in a completely unrelated major.**\n\ndon't sugar coat it for me. This is the first time since i graduated last may that a company was actually interested in hiring me. Its a large university hiring for biomedical research they do. I'd hate to finally have a tentative offer only to have hr give the thumbs down. If my hiring manager (whom i've built a rapport with) is emphatic enough, could he sway them? \n\nThanks as always guys",

        "body": "So, I'm about to graduate and I've been fortunate enough to receive two job offers (to the other new grads, I applied to over 300 jobs, you'll find one). One is a return offer with the company I've been interning with, the other is a new company.\n\nI'm pretty content with both offers, although I do plan to negotiate, but that's not what this is about.\n\nIn one of the offers, my role would be Software Engineer and I'd be doing actual software engineering work. In the other, my role is an \"Application Engineer\", which uses some (much more advanced) Scratch like software to let you \"Drag n Drop\" applications together, with only minor programming involved. Beyond this, the role also entails a fair amount of project management, sales, etc (interacting with clients).\n\nSo my question is, if I want to be a software engineer in the future, would being an application engineer for a year + listing the entailed job responsibilities make it harder for me to transition to a full-time SE later on? I feel like if I'm applying for SE jobs and recruiters see \"Used Scratch++ to build applications for clients\", they won't be very impressed and may not be as likely to hire me compared to if I just had traditional SE experience. On the flip side though, I imagine they would like to see that I have soft skills (sales, PM, client management, etc) that I would not gain from the Software Engineer job.\n\nJust curious to see if anyone has any thoughts on this, of course there is no \"right\" answer!",

I have been fortunate enough to work a summer internship as a full-stack developer utilizing React and Node.JS (typescript for both) as well as a year long internship working as a system developer using Java (no frameworks AFAIK). I also have a lot of AI experience through clubs using Python but I am not really a big fan of working with ML/AI, still worth mentioning since I believe Django has a decent market share for backend.\n\nI am trying to make myself as attractive a candidate as possible through bolstering my personal portfolio. I have two projects on it thus far, both of which have used React and Node.JS. I am hoping to have a couple more full stack side projects by the time I graduate, on top of having my AWS certifications and enhancing my side projects with their services. \n\nI was wondering if you guys think it would be worth creating projects in C#/Java since currently I am hoping to work primarily in backend as this is the field I have found most compelling so far. Those two languages obviously dominate the backend job market currently but it seems like overkill to use these for projects that aren't of enterprise scale, in addition to having a higher learning curve than other languages and frameworks. I really like working with Node.JS and am quite comfortable throwing servers together with Express. I also have demonstrable work experience with Java thanks to my current internship even though it is not in a traditional web development setting. Ultimately, do you guys think it would be worth it to teach myself Java or C# for the backend of future side projects or would it be better to gain more experience with Node.JS? If so, should I bolster my Java knowledge or jump into C# which seems to be a much more developer friendly experience? Job market seems evenly split in my area.\n\nTL;DR, upcoming CS graduate can't decide if I should continue making side projects with Node.JS or branch off and learn Java/C# to prepare me for enterprise jobs",

I've also done a lot of facilitation in my personal life outside of work - personal growth type things.\n\nWell, until now one of our Sr SWE's has been doubling as our SCRUM master (he also trained SCRUM masters before coming onboard with us). He just got promoted to Director of SW, and he asked me if I'd be interested to be the SCRUM facilitator for my team, because he's noticed my facilitation skills and thinks I'd be good at it.  I know SCRUM master is often a full-time job, but he said he doesn't expect me to do much more than go to the same meetings I'm going to now, like retro, standup, etc.  This is what he's been doing in the same position, so I believe him.\n\nIf I say yes, it'll come with a pay bump, although he hasn't given me a number yet.

For my second coop work term (Jan 2019), I only had 4 months of work experience, did like 50 applications, got 7-8 interviews and multiple offers. Now with that coop work term experience, I did almost 500 applications, over 10-12 interviews and no offer so far. I have done a lot of mock interviews, did 130 leetcode problems, had referrals, and had really good interviews but it seems like it is almost impossible to get an internship now. My friends who work at FAANG and with whom I practiced Mock, told me that the best way to approach a problem is to give them a suboptimal solution, then work with your interviewer to give an optimal solution, and even if you can't, if you share your thought process, they will take you in (one of my friend couldn't solve a faang problem but talked out his thought process and got the job at that same company). Seems like it is no longer the case. Interviewers want an optimal solution at the first try, and if I work with them, I just get rejected. I recently had an interview with SAP where they gave me 2 problems, i gave them optimal for the one and suboptimal for the second one and my interviewer told me I did really well, and I was really good at communicating my thought process, yet I got rejected.\n\nI really am feeling extremely burnt out and tired. if this is the norm, how can I even break into the industry? My high gpa that I worked really hard for, my interview prep that I spent hours after hours with my friends, spending time on my resume, countless mock interviews with coop office, paid service and with my friends, all are just going to waste. I am not only tired and concerned that maybe I should not be in the field in the first place. My other engineering friends even in this job market didn't have to go through that many interviews, and some coop programs (especially civil, mining and geotechnical) have almost 100% placement rate (meaning almost everyone who was in the coop program secured a work term this summer)\n\nI don't know, I chose software engineering because I really loved making small web and mobile apps, and always wanted to know how video games work, but it is really burning me out right now with all this interview prep and the disappointment I am getting after getting rejected even though I felt I did really well. It's endless cycle of rejections. I really want some advice as to what should I be doing next? Switching to some other engineering field? Go to grad school? Just give up? I am also really concerned as to whether I even have a chance to break into the career if this is the stage of internship interview, then new grad is almost next to impossible.\n\nAlso just to clarify, I am applying to everything, not just big name companies. Most of them are local with a few in other Canadian provinces and a few to US companies. \n\nThanks",

I asked for very little help during this sprint which is why I'm confused he'd bring up my understanding.

I am having an offer from my old company to start again as a senior it project manager. My ultimate long-term goal would be to work remotely as ruby/JS backend developer.\n\nShould I take the job and transition slowly (doing code wars and own projects on the side), advancing my skills only in my freetime and search a new job on the side or do a clean cut and search a jr dev. position (probably earning 40% less money for the next years) and having more time to focus on advancing my skills as my day-to-day job?\n\nThanks fo your support girls and guys :)",

        "body": "Hi all, thanks for reading and helping me out. I've been at Microsoft  for 2.5 years as a PM for a couple teams. I've been working here since graduation and have an EE degree with a minor in CS. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to code or do many 'technical' projects while on these teams and don't have any internship experience, so I'm considering myself as having 'zero-experience' although that's not completely true. I would like to switch roles to software engineering as I think this position better aligns with my interests and provides an opportunity to gain more useful and tangible skills. I have a couple questions I hope folks could help me with:\n\n1. [I saw this older post from the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6e0dm4/are_remote_entry_level_positions_rare/) about finding entry level remote positions, and how rare it is. Now that we've been working from home for the last year I imagine (or hope) that there would be more opportunities for entry level remote work? If that's the case, any advice on where to look? If not remote, what would be the best listings to find entry-level positions?\n2. It will be easiest for me to pivot internally but am interested in exploring other companies. I'm not sure if being at Microsoft is a better help considering my role but, is there anything you think I could do to better my chances of switching companies (beyond \"doing side projects\")?\n3. I'm currently going through CTCI and attempting a couple LeetCode problems a day (studying Java). My coding experience is limited to Java and C which I studied in school. I know that lots of companies use more modern languages such as React, TypeScript, etc. Is it necessary for me to learn these to standout as 'relevant' (such as taking a bootcamp course, or doing a side project in these languages)?  I know \"anything helps\" but 'm trying to optimize my studying since I have a full-time job.\n\nI may need some help deciding on whether to pivot companies or try to move internally (and then pivot) but would like to start here. Thanks for reading and any advice",

Basically, I still have a lot of world left to see.\n\nThis whole time I've been vying for a career within data science. I've been doing work in my internships related to that as well as doing research and taking classes about the concepts in the field.\n\nHowever, I recently had a meeting with an advisor (a well-respected CS prof at my uni) who claimed that data science is like cookie cutter coding... you just use code that's already been written and mold it to fit your problem (his sister is a data scientist at Facebook). I don't know how much of this is true, but it really turned me off to the idea of a career in data science and now I'm feeling a little lost as to what I want to do.\n\nI was drawn to the field because of the possibility of working with the cutting edge, solving new and unique problems, and doing super cool work. I've enjoyed the projects I've been able to work on so far, but I know there's still so much of the industry I have yet to see.\n\n**Can anyone tell me more about what it's like doing data science work in industry?

        "body": "When I graduated with my bachelor's in Computer Science, I really wanted to go on a data science path, deciding to start as a Data Analyst and later go back for my masters to try to be a Data Scientist. For reasons I don't want to get into, I decided that's not the path I want to take, I want to just do programming full-time. I do a little bit of SQL and Python at work, but not enough to satisfy me, or tell interviewers that I did proper software development in those languages, mostly bug fixes and scripting.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't have any real internships, I just volunteered on-and-off for about a year and a half on a website my friend made, it was C#, MS SQL, and Bootstrap. I wrote maybe like 10 web pages of varying complexity, with a lot of guidance from my friend. My friend stopped doing the website several months ago and I can't really carry it on, I don't have the permission or expertise, as he pretty much told me what to write and only I understood some (but not all) of it, though towards the end I was getting more independent. \n\nThe C# stack my friend used is pretty old, I really don't see many jobs requiring any of the front-end stuff we used; it's all react/angular and typescript/javascript now from what I'm seeing. In the few technical interviews I've made it to, they're surprised/disappointed I don't know REST, MVC, or Javascript. The jobs I'm applying for I can usually do fine in the interviews and pass the (easy) coding assessment, I just don't think I tick the boxes for recruiters or hiring managers because my stack isn't really common anymore.\n\nAs all my C# experience sorta ended several months ago, I'm really rusty on remembering how certain things worked and my friend really isn't available to help me with that stuff. Unfortunately for me, this seems like the best life line I have on my resume to hop over to software development.\n\nAre there any options I have other than just spending all my free time forcing myself to learn javascript/typescript/angular/rest, or will the right opportunity come along eventually? I don't really care if I'm front-end or back-end, I just want a job and obviously the least amount of extra work I have to do after working 40+ hours a week would be nice. Are there other things I should prioritize learning instead? And just as a note, I'm not trying to get into a FAANG here, just any old job would be cool.\n\n**tl;dr - Only real experience other than my cs degree was some volunteering on a website where I was guided through everything by a more senior dev. The site used an older stack that didn't use javascript/typescript/react/angular/REST/etc. so I was wondering if I had to learn those to get an entry-level job. What do I need to do?**",

Now then, this offer expires in a few days, so I would have to make the choice pretty fast.\n\nThe issue is I recently got in contact with someone at General Motors, who I have heard a lot less negative things about on this reddit. My interviews with them would start past the date of accepting the offer from Cognizant, and I'm not guaranteed to get a job with them after I go through these interviews. But again, I have heard less negative things about them compared to Cognizant.\n\nBoth of their start dates are in June, and are fairly close in what times they will reopen and I will have to relocate to where they want me to work at.

You people are working yourselves and others up over something that doesn't actually matter.\n\nI've been in the industry for 10 years now. I don't have a college degree and I never went to a bootcamp. I've had about 6 jobs in the industry so far. I've been everything from a junior dev, to a mid dev, to a senior dev, to a team lead.

        "body": "Before covid (Summer 2019?) I had posted this:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dflwh8/salary_negotiation_question/\n\nSo after I posted this I was pretty persistent about my promotion with my manager.  Because I was designing the system rewrite from the ground up, I believed I satisfied the SWE III requirements.\n\nMy manager didn't really agree, which was really disappointing, and he seemed to be ambivalent about the whole situation.  He didn't understand that my promotion had to be put in before a certain date and missed it.  This was January 2020.\n\nAt that point I escalated it two levels up and had a one on one with the manager of all software engineering for my company.  He was definitely more receptive but was also trying to make the point that I was \"silo'ed\" and needed to do more stuff to get my work noticed.\n\nCoincidentally a month later we had a huge project come in with an incredibly aggressive timeline.  I was able to shift gears quickly and help complete the project, being a fundamental part of it.  This brought us up into March of 2020. \n\nThen COVID hit and I was told that I was SOL and come back in 3-6 months.  That sucked a lot especially since I had busted my ass for a huge company win.  I basically went on cruise control for the next several months, and kept inquiring about my promotion once the 3 month mark had passed.  I started looking for new employment during the summer, just passively and when I had time.  I had probably a dozen interviews over the past year to varying levels of success, some I got really close to closing.\n\nMy manager kept checking and the answer was always no.  As fall and winter rolled around I started nagging more about it.  It was pretty rough, on one end you have corporate saying \"there is no hiring freeze\" but then your manager saying \"all adjustments are on hold.\"  \n\nI had to sit through multiple town halls where they paraded marquees of all the people who did get promotions.  It felt like everyone was getting a promotion BUT ME.  At this point my manager had done a complete 180 and was pretty angry I had been neglected.  During my 2020 performance review I got the highest possible rating.\n\nDespite all this, the corp still tried to say no to my promotion.  This brings us to March 2021.  Upon hearing their refusal again I got more aggressive with my job search.  There were some murmurings that my promotion was going through but it was still taking forever and I was given no ETA.\n\nAfter taking a hackerrank from a company and probably getting what I would consider a C- to D+ on it (finished 4/5 of the problems, most without all test cases fulfilled) I was able to secure an offer of 85k.  I told my employer I was going to leave if they weren't able to get my promotion and more than the offer by Friday.\n\nI was contacted the next day by the manager of software engineering and asked for my range, which I said was 90-100.  He offered me my promotion and 80 on the spot which I turned down, and was confused by.  Pretty much said give me 90-100 or I'm walking.\n\n24 hours later I had secured the promotion to level 3 and a new salary of 90k a year.  It's amazing how fast these things can turn around when you threaten to walk.  I'm pretty happy now, and I didn't want to leave the company I work for because it has great perks and an awesome work life balance.\n\nThanks for reading!",

I have not gotten a response as of the writing of this post.\n\nWhile I understand that the bottom line ultimately affects the availability of positions, this company has also been hiring for similar positions while I've been co-op'ing for them, so I find the 'quarterly results' reasoning to be a bit questionable.\n\nThat being said, I can tell that my boss has definitely made an attempt to get me a full-time position since he has generally been impressed with my work. I have a feeling that he couldn't tell me anything in April because he was in the middle of discussing it with the company.\n\nAs for the lack of response from yesterday's email, I think it's most likely because he thinks that I'm going to leave if he tells me there isn't a position now. \n\nI haven't had trouble landing interviews, and I know that it's only a matter of time before I land a position somewhere.

        "body": "Trying to get some outsiders' thoughts on my situation so I can gauge how it compares to other workplaces. This is my second job as a programmer, and my first was a two-year stint at a company where there were no other programmers at all, so I don't have much basis for reference.\n\nI work at a smaller company of about 40 people total. The dev team is 8 people including me and my boss the CTO. Our product is a SaaS service with a few tens of thousands of users.\n\nI've been here for three years and am the only \"senior engineer.\" I got promoted into this role after one year at the company. In any reasonable situation, I would probably not hold the \"senior\" title, but I'm a big fish in a small pond in that the rest of the team (including my boss) are very junior engineers who frequently need hand-holding with basic concepts.\n\nStuff that has me unhappy in my role:\n\nWe don't do testing, full stop. Nobody on the team, including me, has experience writing tests. (I don't think most even understand what tests are or why they're useful.) QA is done by one non-technical guy clicking around the platform to see if everything seems good.\n\nSince the app is large and sprawling, the above QA process is not enough to prevent the regular occurrence of severe bugs in production. The process for resolving such situations is to Slack me, tell me it's super urgent, and let me figure it out. It's not practical to attempt to involve other members of the team, since they have neither the general experience nor the familiarity with the codebase to be able to help. (To his credit, my boss often tries to investigate the problem himself if it's something urgent, but again, doesn't usually have the knowledge or problem-solving skills needed to be of any help.)\n\nNew features are developed by the junior devs with little guidance. (Being the senior engineer, I try to provide guidance to the best of my ability, but I don't have the time to be closely involved in several different ongoing projects when I'm also assigned my own time-sensitive projects and have to field regular emergencies.) Once a PR is made, it goes through a perfunctory \"code QA\" process, where another member of the team, usually another junior dev, glances over it to make sure nothing is obviously wrong.\n\nIt then passes into \"product QA\" and is put in a staging environment where the QA guy clicks around to see if it looks good. (The process of deploying code to that QA environment takes about half an hour each time and often fails. There was a project done by the CTO and the previous senior engineer in collaboration with an external company over the course of about a year to improve our infrastructure, which somehow resulted in the current cumbersome and error-prone process, where I often have to interrupt my work to resolve issues with it so that QA can continue.) When he finds problems, he writes them down somewhere, and the dev responsible for the project will resolve the QA issues by making further commits that are not subject to code review. This process usually accounts for at least half of the time spent working on large projects, so a great deal of the code that makes it into production was never looked at by anyone. \n\nDeadlines do not change in response to changing situations during development and QA. For big projects, the norm is that on the day the deadline rolls around, we're still actively working on fixing aspects of the feature that are fundamentally broken, and very likely also continuing to receive new information and requirements from the product and design teams.\n\nThe good: my boss is nice, people in general are nice, I've never been yelled at or anything. I'm rarely expected to work more than 40 hours, although in practice I sometimes end up working weekends and see other devs doing so as well.\n\nI dunno, a lot of this is coming out as an angry rant, but I'm aware that there are really toxic workplaces out there and I probably have it good. Is this just the kind of stuff that all workplaces have? Any thoughts are appreciated.",

        "body": "In my country employers usually give a salary range so wide that it is not informative. In the first phone call they usually try to know what would you expect. A strategy I'm using as of recently is to not to put red lines at this stage so that I get to hear an offer. This shows me if the employer is paying according to market, which in turn tells me about expected employee rotation and overall satisfaction.\n\nFor this one position the range went from junior salaries to senior salaries. I'm clearly in the senior category, and was offered a high junior salary. This is lower than any of the other offers I got this year, and only a bit higher than what I earned in my junior times.\nShould I try to negotiate given the situation? Or just look elsewhere? For me it is a big red flag that they even tried.\n\nEDIT: On the other hand, it is (almost) 100% remote and the commuting would be short. They also said they review salaries every year (which I don't really believe, in my experience that never happens)",

        "body": "I currently work for a very large global company that offers good benefits and a 50k annual salary, but I just got offered an internship with the Disney College Program which lasts about 6 months. I graduated a year ago in May 2020 and getting to for a famous entertainment/tech company seems like a dream come true. This internship pays me 1/3rd less than what I\u2019m being paid right now. Here are some thoughts I had about this scenario: \n\nIf I leave my current company and go for Disney, I\u2019m going for something... \n\n1. I have a chance for something that seems like a lifetime! It\u2019s like you rather go for something and say you did it rather than regretting later that you should have done it \ud83d\ude2d \n2. My dream company is Disney \n3. It might open opportunities for me because I work for Disney at a certain period \n4. And I\u2019m looking for a job now anyway trying to get out of my current job! \n5. It\u2019s 6 months and the job isn\u2019t secure \n\nIf I decline the offer from Disney,\n\n1. I don\u2019t like my job that I\u2019m currently at and I\u2019ll keep thinking about declining that offer I had from my dream company that I had a chance to! \n2. I have a full time job now vs 6 months at Disney.\n3. My associates I work with now are amazing which I can make new friends at Disney so I\u2019m not too worried about that. \n4. The pay is way more here than in Disney \n5. Can work and still make money while looking for a new job rather than a deadline if I were at Disney \n\nI am so excited about this opportunity but the thought of leaving my current full time job for \u201cjust a 6 month internship\u201d, which makes me so overwhelmed! \n\nI started this job last December 2020, and my internship begins in August 2021! I had an internship with Disney back in August 2020 but it got canceled due to COVID - 19.  I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m risking for something that isn\u2019t secure when I have something already secured. And I know my parents wouldn\u2019t be too happy with that as well. I want to ask for time off but 6 months seems like a lot of time. \n\nI\u2019m 23 and I live with my parents. I\u2019m saving a lot of money now but my current job requires a lot of relocation in the future for higher positions. The situation at home is getting unbearable which is why I\u2019m always out all the time until I have to come home.\n\nSo it really feels like I\u2019d be wasting this opportunity if I I don\u2019t take it. And this internship is a big change for me where I feel like I can\u2019t say no. But I feel like if I leave my full time position for something that\u2019s temporary - I would feel very uptight about it. \n\nI\u2019m afraid I may be making a huge mistake for my future and feel so indecisive as to the pathway I should take.

        "body": "Hey all,\n\nI've been browsing this sub for a while now.  I sometimes comment, but usually, just lurk.  I'm currently in quite a conundrum...\n\nAnyways, I'll try to make this as short and succinct as I can without leaving out the full story.  So, I graduated college in 2019 with a degree in marketing.  I realized soon after graduating that I didn't care at all about marketing.  In my marketing degree, I actually took a programming class.  It involved JavaScript and programming web apps.\n\nI of course have heard all the hype about coding bootcamps and securing high salaries with the knowledge and apps(added to portfolio) from Bootcamps.  I decided to just jump in full steam to a coding bootcamp.  I ended up finishing it right when the dumbass pandemic hit.. (April 2020 I believe)\n\nOf course, when Covid first hit the economy tanked and a lot of jobs went away..  Finding an entry-level software job as someone without a CS degree proved to nearly impossible.  I went pretty hard on the job search regardless, however.  Over 500 apps later I got burnt out.  I had a few interviews but they didn't really go anywhere.\n\nWith feeling like nothing was getting accomplished, I figured perhaps if I want to get into this field I needed a CS degree to be taken seriously.  And I figured if I got a good job while taking classes I could either throttle down to 1 class per semester or perhaps just *unofficially* drop out. (Meaning just not re-registering for classes..)  I ended up applying to a few colleges, and got accepted to most.  But chose one.\n\nWell, fast forward to the present.  I just bombed my math midterm.  There's only one math class I have to take though. (And tbh I don't care about grades I just want the degree and the knowledge)  I'm wondering if I should just take the L and power through it.  Or if this perhaps a sign more schooling isn't for me?\n\nObviously, you don't have to be in school to continue on one's learning path.  I continue to grind out leetcode.  To brush up on stuff I learned in the past, along with learning new things.\n\nPerhaps I'm justifying wanting to just drop out.  If I'm being honest I'm starting to think I don't even care about SWE.  I just want a good-paying WFH job where I can afford a mortgage(in MCOL area) and able to buy as many video games I want. (lol)\n\n**TL;DR(Sort of):** I don't have a degree in CS, but want to get into the industry.  So did coding bootcamp, but can't get a job.  Despite applying to hundreds of jobs, constantly revising my resume, and doing most everything; *Except getting a degree in CS*.  So I decided to get a degree in CS.  In first semester, but just bombed my math midterm.(I understand the material, just suck at taking tests btw)  Questioning everything....  Any advice?  (Btw I actually enjoy programming, and it fits my personality, so I would like to somehow get a programming job..) *I hate school, but love learning as well, that's a pretty important thing to mention if I'm being 100% honest..*",

The salary is $94,000 for the duration of the contract and will have a raise that has yet to be determined after the contract is up assuming I\u2019m brought in permanently.\n\nThis role is also fully remote and allows me the ability to live anywhere in the country and will remain so after the contract.  The role also will have me getting hands on work with AWS and will improve my own marketability greatly.  \n\nThe only downside I\u2019m seeing with this new position is that it\u2019s a contract to hire and I may not have a job after 6 months.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these two positions and contracts to hire?\n\nDo you have any experience with Cigna or contract to hire type positions? \n\nWhich job would you pick?",

It's a big company most of you have heard of, but I'll keep their name quiet.\n\nMy expectations for this internship were to maybe debug some code, write small scripts (I work for an automation team), and do small things to start. I wrote maybe half of a working script before I got assigned a major project. \n\nWhile I'm grateful for the experience this gives me, I still feel like maybe I was overworked? Overestimated? I'm to build a web app from front-to-back, that helps us automate some internal workflows. I was assigned this entirely to myself, the intern, and had freedom to choose the tech stack. I was given some repos and libraries to reference, as they were similar/needed to what I was tasked to build. Then, off I go to build an entire web app.\n\nI was interviewed for Python automation, but now I'm building a fullstack web app from scratch. I'm spending most of my time writing React code, which I had 0 knowledge of going into this. I was hoping for more Python work, as I would like to go into Data Science in the future, and Python is heavily needed for that, but I'm stuck writing JavaScript.\n\nTo be fair, I have learned a ton. Enough to produce a pretty usable app, but there's a lot of fault and bugs that I'm sure are due to my lack of experience. I'm constantly rewriting my code, my manager doesn't look over my code too often, and I'm kinda just this free-roaming fullstack web developer with little guidance.

I do know that I want to go for a development role, rather that marketing, or Customer relations, etc. But what sort of developer? Full Stack Engineer is something I'm currently eyeing. My final year project is based on NLP, so ML/AI also sounds great, but I hear that freshers or people with just a year of experience aren't preferred for it. I have some knowledge of iOS app development, so that seems like a possible alley too.\n\nTo give you a clear picture, here is my list of preference, and how much I know I'm each:\n\n1. Full Stack/Web Dev - Good with front end (just, good); okay with backend, need to be a lot better; can learn database, it's been more that 2 years since I typed a query\n\n2. iOS - Only learning a little but of Swift, still not good, but will be soon\n\n3. ML/AI - decent exposure through a research project (yet to be published), however, it doesn't interest me as much as the previous two\n\nI'd say it's almost a tie between 1 and 2\n\nNow, coming to the long route; let's say I'm not able to move to a Dev role at my present company after a year, for whatever reason. What should my next plan be? How can I move to a Dev role, from a support role.\n\nAnd if anyone can give me tips on how to learn, or what to learn to be good at the mentioned fields, please do help me out\n\nCheers :)",

        "body": "TLDR; husband is depressed and overwhelmed and stopped working again. But we are in debt for his startup. What can I do?\n\n\\---\n\nMy husband has been doing startups for over 8 years. He has been as an executive within several startup companies in the first few years, then he started to do his own startups one after another. He failed at most of it. One of them is however still alive but he got a fight with his former partner so he left that company.\n\nLast year he got really depressed and not working for half of year. This year, he got another idea and found another guy who he found really happy to work with as business partners so they started a new company. He was super excited and felt happy again. He's been meeting people for several months and I would say he's actually doing very well at impressing people. But recently he started to be depressed again. I think he tends to get tired or overwhelmed by the things he doesn't like to do (exp, real management work, financial, etc), and he keeps having new ideas he wants to do and gets distracted. Also he borrowed some money so I think he's also very anxious about finance. Anyway, recently since he's depressed, he basically stopped working, instead, he watches TV and playing video games most of the time.\n\nI don't know what to do. I tried to cheer him up or ignore his emotions and just focusing my own stuffs, but it didn't help. I tried to talk to him a long time ago (this kind of situation is not the first time, it happens to him a lot) and he just got more depressed or angry, or he went to work the rest of that day but return to play games the next day...I wasn't anxious when he borrowed the money, because I thought it's normal in the beginning phase, but now I am really worried. One day, he said he wanted to go to restaurants, but I said we are in debts so we should save any little pennies. But he disagreed and still went out.\n\nI'm not just worrying about finance, I'm more worried about him. With his serial entrepreneurship history, I think a lot of companies will avoid hiring him if someday he wants to go back to be an employee. Also because he was either CTO or CEO, so a lot of senior developer positions will just overlook him. The last reason I'm worried is because, it looks like if he fails this time or abandons it again, he will think his life is completely over and it will be very hard for him to get back to his feet again.",

In case nobody starts using them I hope to have a pretty good portfolio, thus being somewhat employable.\n\nWorking part-time is something I could definitely see myself doing, but I don't know how realistic getting such a position is.\n\nFreelancing is another avenue which I'd like to pursue both as a fullstack developer and a musician. \n\nI'd highly appreciate any advice on how to approach all of this.\n\nMay you be happy :)",

I'm back in school, but I'm absolutely dreading it(currently disputing with the math department over a class with an 85% fail rate), and some people have reached out to me recently to start applying for jobs again here and there. \n\nEssentially every posting says \"Bachelors Degree in EECS or Equivalent Work Experience,\" naive me assumed that 5 years working full time would equate to  a bachelor's degree in CS worth of knowledge, right? Today I saw my first posting that actually clarified that a Bachelor's degree should be equivalent to 12 years work experience? I'm sorry what? \n\nI'm in my junior year, and none of my CS classes have taught me anything I would ever use on the job? I already knew everything for my Data Structures and Algos class from grinding Leetcode for interviews, our \"advanced\" 400 level web dev really delves into how to declare javascript functions, etc. \n\nI'm definitely a bit salty, but now I'm reconsidering if I should really prioritize school first considering I don't have 10+ years of experience on my resume yet.

        "body": "I know Im going to get backlash for this but I believe that being able to communicate your interests to your manager is very important- a common theme this sub struggles in.\n\nI was recently hired for an embedded team (Team A) couple of months ago. Due to some conflicts I was loaned to a full stack team (Team B)  approx 6mo - 1 year.  During team selection, I interviewed with the Team B manager who said they have a lot of funding and they can keep me long term if I wanted to stay. Because this was over the phone 1-on-1 I am not sure if this was agreed upon between both managers. The culture doesnt seem toxic but I cant tell..\n\nFast forward to 3 months later... The hiring manager from Team A calls me and says I am able to move over to their team. Great! I thought- Then... they state I have 2 options move to the embedded test team or lab operations team for couple months of training then transition to the embedded development team. Both test and lab teams dont interest me (sounds like combination of SDET and devops but not really) and I am losing hope in those roles. Also the tech stack and process isnt as modern for the embedded team compared to the full stack team.\n\nI have a meeting with my hiring manager from Team A this week. I plan to let them know I want to stay with the dev team. My only concern is promotions. The dev team is remote for me while the others are in the bay area or east coast. Without an on-site manager in my area I feel like this will be an uphill battle for promotions. At any rate if I go to embedded team I will likely leave as Im no longer interested in that career path. Only thing holding me back for 1 year is the hiring and relocation bonuses...\n\nYOE: \\~1 embedded. 0.5 full stack\n\nBSEE background and graduating grad school for MSCS this fall.   \n\n\nTLDR: Hired as embedded swe. Temp loaned to full stack team for 6months - 1 year with loaned manager saying I could potentially stay. Budgeting (?) conflicts resolved and I would be transferred to embedded team which I lost interest in. Not sure how to talk to hiring manager to let them know I want to stay. I just want to be transparent with my interests.",

        "body": "Hi all. A little background about me... I graduated from a MS in Math last May. I have extensive coursework in math/stats/CS/ML, did a computation-heavy thesis (simulations in Python, not ML) which led to a publication as first author, and taught undergrad calculus. My university was a no-name state university in a rural area with few connections to tech and I don't have much of a network. I have no industry experience/internships -- I intended to do a PhD but realized it wasn't for me.\n\nDue to health issues I've been taking time off after graduating. I've sharpened my technical skills and completed a few projects in the last few months and have started applying for jobs. I think my background and interests are most suited to a DS role; however, these roles seem to be highly contested by PhDs and people with several YoE. My math background should put me ahead of many candidates (e.g. non-quantitative BS + MSDS), but I feel my lack of a PhD or previous experience prevents me from being a strong candidate. Also, because of how poorly-defined DS roles are, I get the sense a lot of companies don't know what they're looking for, and the interviews can test you on anything.\n\nI've heard that starting as a analyst or SWE is a better route into DS/ML. I'm not really interested in the dashboarding and SQL duties that an analyst role entails. I've learned some web dev skills (Django, JS/React, etc.) to deploy ML models and think a SWE (web dev) role could be fitting. I'd have to practice LC like hell, though.\n\n**Given my background should I apply to DS or SWE positions to optimize my chance of landing a job?** I'm more aligned with DS, but it is insanely competitive at entry level, and my callback rate has been low. Alternatively, I have *some* SWE skills and the barrier to entry is lower.",

Kinda like an artist.\n\nHowever, working as frontend developer felt like the exact opposite. Your only task is to translate the ideas of your designer and his clients into code. Your website has to be a perfect copy of a template somebody else has made. It's was depressing and I simply couldn't stand it anymore.

I just want something more for myself and I don\u2019t want my age to be a factor as to yeah I should have this and that figured out, etc. \n\nI started school at my local community college in the fall of 2019, I finished up my last 2 gen Ed\u2019s, college algebra and csc 111. The following spring I took precalc 1 and csc 112 and ended up failing those classes because the pandemic started and zoom classes just wasn\u2019t doing it for me (yes I know that\u2019s a bad excuse and I should of passed). So fast forward to now, I will be taking precalc 1 & 2 this summer.\n\nMy goal is to take all the lower level CS classes at my community college and transfer them back to the university I first attended. At that point I will have to finish my upper level courses, electives and another math class (calc 2 I think it is).\n\nAt my community college, I have 7 classes left to take:\nComputer science 2\nDatabase management systems \nData structures and algorithms \nDiscrete mathematics \nCalc 1  \nPrecalc 1 & 2\n\nAll the classes above except precalc 1 & 2 are transferable to university.\n\nOkay so I guess that\u2019s a lot of background info...but my question is it worth going back to school at this age? I would like to be a software engineer. A lot of ppl have counted me out unfortunately. I want to prove them wrong as well as prove to myself I can do this. Also Idk if information science & technology could be an option as well because the CS math courses are kinda scary and I\u2019m not a math wiz or anything.

When I do get stuck, they can't help and Im just left furiously Googling the answer to things which has been working out okay so far. He asked me to read a paper on a particular algorithm and after I made a presentation on it I had some questions like in what instance would you use this over traditional CNNs and he couldn't even answer. \n\nThe internship is a year long so it's not a suck it up and get it over with type situation, and I'm currently not in a position to be able to leave the internship. I'm firstly slightly resentful that I was baited and switched when I had other opportunities in ml that I turned down to join his project. And secondly, I feel like I'm not learning anything from this supervisor. He keeps pushing me to work on this platform when he is of no help at all (his idea of helping is asking me for a design change when I hardly know what I'm doing) and is deviating from the internship agreement where I was supposed to be learning ml. I did try to express my unhappiness (quite poorly, I must admit) but nothing has changed. Also to note this a research team, and my internship allowance is paid for by another entity and not the company itself. I'm not an employee there.\n\nEdit: it was the 12th week into the internship that I had my first taste of ml, but was subsequently told to get right back to developing the platform. Also it's just strange that they are asking me to build the platform even before the ml model has been developed when the platform is supposed to be fore the model (I'm guessing it has something to do with my supervisors deliverables that's why he's pushing me to do it).",

The minor got me a lot of theoretical classes (data struct. and algorithms, probability, etc.). But I don't think I have that much practical experience. I've been coding for my thesis for \\~3 years now but academic science coding is not the same, take my word for it. If I was to drop out, I would probably try to find a bootcamp to brush up my skills a bit more. \n\nI'm not worried about liking a career in CS, I think I would, but I am worried I wouldn't be a competitive candidate for jobs. Thoughts/advice about steps I would need to take to be a good candidate?",

I'm decent at leetcode and it kinda come to me easier because of my math background. But the caveat of this switch is maintaining a salary that helps out my fam for atleast now (willing to relocate anywhere I just help them financially). Wondering if it's doable and if so if you guys have advice.\n\n**Long Form Explanation Below:**\n\n1. I work at a semiconductor foundry as a materials engineer. I'm the guy trynna make sure the supply meets demand however, I want to switch over to CS because I don't like the location and I am decent at coding.\n2. With my background I didn't know which direction to go through so I went on free code camp and just went the web dev route. Thought why not.\n3. I want to leverage my previous technical experience so I was wondering if you all wanted to help me find my place in the Computer Science world. I already know python due to using for research before. However, the data science route seemed to be the most stringent on degrees and certifications. That's why I started to pick up web dev. Seemed the most fluid and I can knock out javascript and a couple projects by the end of the year.\n4. My only caveat with not leverging my current resume is that I do have a salary requirement. I am right now helping my family out and paying for their bills along with mine for now since they got screwed by the pandemic. It won't be for long but I would need to maintain my salary of 89k atleast to do so. Is that doable if I switch? I can leetcode very very well. I am learning the whole algorithms and data structures aspect but, my math background kinda helps out a lot (I dual majored in math in college). This whole thing got brought up because my friend at Capital One landed about that much starting off in Texas. But I don't know if he was a fluke. ",

Since I wasn't aware whether I'm getting the raise or not  (when inquiring I was only told that it's in progress, I sort of felt like I'm not getting it) I began searching for something new. \n\nI applied for couple of companies, got couple much better offers and told my manager look, I got these much better offers what raise can you offer me to stay - this was very lucrative since they offered me 30% raise. The offers I got were still better by around 20% but since I like my current job, maybe it's a bit boring but I'm working only couple hours a day realistically with no stress and flexibile working hours, I stayed.\n\nBut then there was this one company that I was in recruitment process with and just for kicks, because I got the raise already, I told them I want a LOT of money - we're talking around 50% more than my current role with a raise. \n\nIt's worth mentioning that I work in Europe where I'm already earning the top 2% salary in my country.\n\nIt seems they weren't really discouraged by that and I got the offer.\n\nNow I'm faced with a really tough decision - whether to stay in my comfortable current role which already pays a lot ,with no stress and working couple of hours a day or change for this new one.\n\nThe new role has couple of cons though\n\n* the working hours are not that flexible (8-16) I prefer working a bit earlier (7-15)\n* more work - I'm assuming I will have to start working like a regular human being 8 hours a day\n* more responsibility since I would assume ownership of their app and will be the only person working on it\n* changing jobs is always stressful since there will be new people which might not be reasonable (the guys I spoke during the interview were pokay though)\n\nI feel I'm already a bit spoiled by the current role and it might be healthy for me to start working more :D \n\nBut whenever I think about the cons I also think about money which would allow me to buy a house in my country every year :D",

I get too overwhelmed by all the code reviews, GIT merges, build failures, dealing with scrum, story points, deadlines, product issues, etc.\n\nOne thing I do enjoy is writing automated and integration tests.

        "body": "So, a bit of context.\n\nI've been in tech for a bit less than 4 years now. Initially, I was working with a lot of technologies like .NET/Android/Deployement as an intern/Jr Developer. But since mid-2018 I've been mostly working in Front-end. In these 4 years, I've worked at 3 different companies (a small tech service company, a big product based e-commerce firm, and a couple years-old decently funded startup). So, it's safe to say that I've seen it all.  \n\n\nBack in high-school I had a huge interest in CS and always aced the CS exams and that's the reason I got a CSE degree (from a below-average school with average grades). But that's not the case now. Since the past 2 years, I'm constantly doubting if CS is really the right career for me. To be honest, the only reason I'm in tech is because it pays well. But, there's no gurantee that 10 years from now, there would still be such high salaries for software engineers. Currently the demand-supply ration is skewed towards engineers (for mid and senior positions). But, with 10 year olds learning to code in school, It's hard to envision what the future will be.\n\n  \nI'd love to study CS concepts even if I wasn't paid to do it. But working in the industry, it just induces so much anxiety to me on a daily basis. One reason for that is that I'm just not good enough and I'm probably mediocre at best (possiblly low-iq or I'm just not wired that way). But even if that were true, I see a lot of mediocre guys who are living a stress-free life.\n\n  \nThe reason for my anxiety is that there's so much to wrap your head around and it's hard to keep up if you want to stay in the industry. Due to living in constant hell, I'm considering a career-shift in psychology due to the following reasons:\n\n1. It would help me understand myself better and figure out the issues I'm going through\n2. I've always been intersted in how the brain functions what causes addictions.\n3. It woud give me some time to heal my brain\n4. Psychology degrees are not as demanding as CS (from what I've heard). This could be a chance to explore other interests and figure out what I really want to do with my life.\n\n  \nPlan is to go for a master's degree and then probably go into a specalised field where I could use both, my CS and Psych degree or work my way towards a Phd.\n\nI don't know if I'm delusional or just straight up crazy. But, life's too short.  I don't want to be 80 and have regrets that I just wasted my life doing something I wasn't enjoying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr;**\n\nWorkign as a software engineer in the industry is mentally taxing.

I like the job I guess, but I don't have any work experience in CS related fields besides this one, so what do I know about whether I really like it or not lol. I've been here for 2 months, by the end of month 3 I am apparently supposed to either get fired or be offered a full time position there (I am like 90% sure I'm getting a full time offering fwiw). No idea what the full time salary would be, but I imagine its probably around $36/hr? Just based off vague salary discussions with my friend who works there lol\n\nI feel like I have so little experience, and so I feel a desire to reach out and just acquire as many work experiences as possible. To me, working somewhere new often seems like an important thing to do since I'm young and trying to dip my feet in the water you know? But my friend says its too soon and I should at least get a full year with this company, saying that it looks bad if I were to work somewhere for less than a year. However, don't internships carry the connotation of being a work thing that is understood to not have to be a year+ endeavour? So I was thinking maybe I could get away with only working there for 3-4 whatever months, and then snagging a new job that hopefully teaches new things and experiences I wouldn't normally learn from working at this specific company. I have to acknowledge though, I am so new to a lot of software engineering that if I worked at this company for a full year I know I would learn plenty of software development...\n\nI made a bullet list of reasons I want to and don't want to leave. I was wondering if anyone here could graciously offer their advice/suggestion on what I should do? **Should I try to find a new job after working at an internship for 3-4 months, or stay with the company for a full time SW Eng. position because its too short of a time to dip out?**\n\nReasons I want to leave:\n* I feel a strong urge to get many different work experiences while I'm young\n* I want to work abroad badly. I'd stay with this job if they let me work remote 100% of the time temporarily, like for a 6 month span so that I could live abroad, but I highly doubt that they'd let me do that even if covid is still going on\n* Not 100% sure, but I think I could find a job with better pay than this company without much difficulty. I just say that because I think its a small enough company and the nature of the company + my experiences so far makes it seem like the kind of company that compensates for paying employees less by giving them greater work freedom/control over their actual programming and promising better wlb.\n\nReasons I don't:\n* This company has incredible wlb, definitely better than almost all other places\n* I actually work with a long time college friend here who helped me get the job, I would definitely miss working with him but you know, if its better for my future career prospects I'm not gonna stay at one company forever just to work with a friend",

When I raised certain concerns about the ability to integrate a new technology into multiple projects that all currently have different build library dependencies and asked about a compromise solution that has been brought up before, I was told that I need to show more respect to the time that was put in to the current proposed solution and that they felt they were only hearing excuses for not wanting to use a new technology (note that I am not the only one to raise these questions before this happened).\n2. When a discussion about this technology was held with a wider group of people that are involved in projects that would be incorporating this new technology at some point (some relatively soon and other a bit later), another person brought up the issue about the build library dependencies (and other issues) and suggested the same compromise solution I did in the previous meeting and I made mention of a task that we had planned for testing that possible issue (this was the outcome of the previous mentioned meeting). Just me bring this up made the same person from the previous meeting tell me that it was an inappropriate setting to bring this up (which I though was odd as that task directly relates to the question that was asked) and that he feared that what I am doing is trying to spread unfair fear and doubt about this technology (other people have brought up other / similar concerns but maybe this person thinks they are only doing that because of me or something).\n\nIf people want to disagree with my opinions or even concerns that I had, I have no problem with that, I am not a stranger to being in the minority when it comes to certain opinions on how to proceed with things but the outcomes of these disagreements are always based on data in some form and not accusing other people of lying or making things up to get their way. What I have virtually zero tolerance for is some telling me I mean something other than what I am saying. If I thought a piece of technology should not be used, I would say exact that with whatever reasons I have for thinking that way.\n\nNormally I would try to have a one on one with this person to figure out a better way to work together however given that in my limited interactions with this person I have already be accused of some ulterior motive that is deeper than what I am actually say, I would have concerns about a one on one and how this person might\u00a0view\u00a0that\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0completely\u00a0different\u00a0manner.\n\nRight now I really don't want to work with this other person at all as I think this kind of hostile work interaction is completely avoidable and counter-productive to the work we are trying to do (I have only deal with this kind of situation, though not directly, once in my 13+ years as a software engineer) and adding this kind of unnecessary stress in addition to the stress that is inherit with the job is just not worth it for me but because of the dynamics of the teams, I think future interactions are unavoidable. The only thing I can think of is agreeing to work on projects with this person but just holding any feedback I might have as to decisions on how to move forward on those project to myself to avoid derailing any project because of something that might not even be related to the project itself and just doing what tasks are given to me.\n\nHow would you handle this situation?",

My question is what would be the future utility of studying subjects such as Mp, OS, Compiler design, assembler, systems design aside from a future where I go into these specific fields? Would knowledge from these subjects be used in interviews/ common projects?\n\nHere systems programming refers to a subject which includes linkers, compilers, interpreters, macros and macro processors. I understand that there is a similarly named subject called Systems Design which is an important subject as questions from it are asked in interviews for high cs positions. Unfortunately that subject is not in our curriculum. What are all of the essential subjects for getting ready for the job market other than OOP, development and data structures and algorithms? \n\nLastly if you know any good studying resources for systems design, please do mention.",

Don't get me wrong, I think in many ways it's helpful and reasonable to expect data scientists to know SQL, be familiar with spark, *maybe* sagemaker and its equivalents, but so many listings seem to be seeking individuals who are experts as data scientists while also being experts at things like building dashboards, reporting, data lakes, pipelines, system design, engineering-intensive scalable cloud stuff...\n\nAre these listings the equivelant of unrealistic software engineering listings seeking \"rock star programmers\" who do everything under the sun? I'm an expert in selecting, training, and tuning ML algorithms, exploring large datasets, gathering all of the info needed to truly understand what is what and what things mean, finding ways to solve business problems using data science and defining use-cases... I've worked alongside engineers and analysts in the past but I've never been expected to be one, but maybe to have my skills overlap with theirs occasionally.\n\nDo I need to get a bunch of AWS certs for all of their data tools and reporting tools?

I got contacted by a small consultancy company, and after talking with the CEO he offered me a chance to work on a new project developing a WEB application from the ground up, that will offer a new service to their clients.\n\nMy concern is that only me and another intern would be working on the project. The choice of the tech-stack, design, etc. will be left up to us. It feels like quite a lot of responsibility for an intern with not that much experience.\n\nAnother problem is that the CEO will be our supervisor. He isn't a strong programmer and we won't have access to more experienced developers to learn from, ask questions, or get some suggestions. I lack the confidence that we can make the best decisions and handle all the aspects of development by ourselves as interns. On the positive side, if we come up with a viable solution we will have a job there after the internship.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I overthinking this and should just accept this internship position or try to find a place that has a bigger dev team that I could learn from? How important was it for you to communicate and learn from more experienced developers during your internship?\n\nTL;DR - Got offered an internship position in a small company where I won't be able to work with or learn from other, more experienced developers.

No onboarding, no shit. They were like they want to do X. So I, from scratch had to build up the codebase that we currently have . Also note that there is nobody to help me label the images or to create datasets, I spend my time building datasets and implementing machine learning pipelines for this system. 50% of my time, I write new features for the code base I make, and the other 50% I test and make sure everything works (physically on the machine / hardware setup) without glitches. There were times when I had to literally go and solder connections between different microprocessors in different modules of this system. I had to setup the system infrastructure (Nvidia GPU Compute server + Network based control and integration different electronic subsystems) and Software Architecture from absolute scratch.\n\nNow the CEO (an asshole) keeps pushing new features one after the other like a feature creep, he doesn't care what I do, he doesn't understand shit about code. Nobody at this startup codes. Recently, he has stopped caring about this project like there are no meetings, or so regrading this major project. He gives a big fuck to the smallest things like why is there dust on the robots? (LOL). So recently, This Boomer CEO is like can you teach me how to code so he can do my job(lol wtf?) . I genuinely thought he is interested in learning programing. Now he is blackmailing me if I don't teach him with PowerPoint slides he is gonna fire me. How the fuck did I end up at this shit show?. Also the CEO is a moonlighting idiot, he rarely cares about this startup and does his 2nd job all the time. Recently he hired some interns to setup his mining server lol.\n\nOh by the way I get paid 1500$ per month lol (yep in a shitty 3rd world country).\n\nHow can I save my career ?

I understand a master\u2019s is typically necessary for an advanced career in the field and so, while in the college application process, I\u2019m keeping this in mind. I\u2019m currently debating whether to go to an OOS higher ranked AI/CS school (places like UIUC, Georgia Tech, UW-Seattle, UC Berkeley) where I can potentially obtain a 5-year master\u2019s and likely would lead to slightly more career opportunities (but where tuition+board would likely be quite high) or to opt to go to my in-state school UVA and then go somewhere else for grad school. UVA certainly has a good CS program but for AI/ML specifically, it\u2019s a bit lacking. And so, in the context of job placement, salaries, meaningful work (maybe researchy type jobs?), and stuff like that, which might be the better option?

After reading a couple of blog posts on employee experience at FAANG(all major tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple) and in other companies like Stripe, Lyft, Razorpay,etc, I have noticed something which I think might be crucial to career growth.\n\nSo I was reading about the procedure at Google, where there is promotion committee. You submit a report on how your contributions to Google helped it and why you should be promoted. Now this committee has never seen your work before and decides whether you should be promoted based on the application. But not everything is quantifiable, like how someone helped his teammates or made documentation for legacy project, etc. These things do not really have well defined metrics. So I believe there are many who work at FAANG but are not promoted easily. They are stuck at the same level for quit a few years.\n\nOn the other hand, companies like Stripe, or startups, etc, although may not provide similar benefits like FAANG, but due to their relatively smaller teams provide better communication among members. This does not mean easy promotion but this also does not mean that individual contributions are not noticeable.\n\nSo my doubt is, if I work at a big tech company for say 4-5 years but with no or just one promotion, then decide to quit and look for job at some other company, is the absence of promotion going to hurt my chances to get a job even though I used to work at the big tech company?\n\nOr if I work at startup, get a few promotions, and then look for job elsewhere, is that better?\n\nNow I am not saying big companies don't promote. One could argue that if one is competent enough company will promote that person. It is just that, since I haven't yet experienced working at a company, I don't know if the competent thing really plays that big of a role in real world or does show business has its role to play too.",

Is the price difference really worth it?\n\nEdit 2: I think I've made up my mind. GA Tech it is. It has a very good program, the material is great, the brand name is very good, and the cost is great. You have access to a wide network given you meet other people who are also in the program. I don't care about the fact that many people have it, recruiters are still impressed by GA Tech, and hiring managers who are too dumb to like another university just because it's a higher price tag and less people pay for it are not worth working for anyways. \n\nBonus question: I am having a hard time choosing between all the specializations. Does this matter much? Are there counselors in Georgia tech that can talk with you about the specializations to figure out which one you do?",

        "title": "Are internships during college worth pursuing?",
        "body": "Hello. This is a question/rant at myself.\n\nI have 3 semesters left (including this one) before graduating. Since college started, I've been trying to land an internship. I spread myself too thin trying to learn a lot of skills needed by the internships I find. I finally managed to interview once and I passed a technical interview but I sucked at the \"management\" interview (the one where they ask you behavioural questions) so I was rejected (they didn't tell me the reason, I just assumed that it's the management interview because it came after the technical one).\n\nIt's frustrating. Every internship requires a different set of skills (at least the ones in my country) and I always feel like my skills and projects aren't enough. Right now, my resume has many skills but I'm not really good in most of them, if I had to use them I will need to review and learn more about them.\n\nMeanwhile, I sort of neglected studying college subjects, telling myself I'll learn them later, but I now regret it. Maybe if I focused on studying the core CS subjects and did a decent project in each of them, I would have more opportunities when I graduate (e.g., be ready to do a master's).\n\nBut I'm still not sure if I should focus the time I have left solely on that or if I should still try to pursue internships. I think initially my desire to find an internship was a dumb one. I think it was along the lines of \"I want to be like Mark Zuckerberg\" or something. I thought I was special just because I started programming at 10 but boy was I wrong. Because of my humongous ego, I made a lot of bad decisions. I kept comparing myself to my colleagues who started interning or freelancing, one of them even worked as a full-fledged SWE in multiple companies!\n\nAnother reason of why I was rushing things so much is because of my anxiety that my chances of finding a job after I graduate will be very low without an internship. A lot of the companies I've seen are either looking for interns or senior devs.\n\nSo right now, I'm confused. I want to know if my fear is justified and if there's a rational reason people pursue internships during college. Right now, the only thing I can think of is money and experience. I need both but more importantly I need knowledge. I don't want to call myself an engineer if I don't have good grasp on these topics (I'm talking about OS, databases, distributed systems, even compilers).\n\n**TL;DR** I wasted a lot of time trying to land an internship but never did. Now I have 2.5 semesters left and I want to know if there's a merit in pursuing an internship or if I should just focus on college.\n\n**Edit** Some details about me:\n\n* I'm from Egypt\n* 2.7 GPA\n* I don't mind working in non-FAANG, in fact I've seen better working environments than FAANG\n* I would prefer living and working in a different country, if my job affords me to\n* I will probably need to work a while after graduating because I can't afford a Master's unless it's a scholarship or something",

I'm not sure what steps to take here, but hopefully, someone can shed light.\n\nMy approach (please correct me if this is not the right way to tackle it):\n\n1, I believe the smartest thing to do right now is to get a TN by becoming a Canadian Citizen.  AFAIk, you only do TN for as long as you can\u2019t get H1B. Good thing is TN can be extended \u201cindefinitely\u201d in 3-year increments, so as a Canadian, you can still work there as long as it takes to get H1B.  I  think you can work forever in the U.S with a  TN and all you have to do is re-apply every 3 years.\n\n2. Apply for H1B while working as a TN, I think I'm stuck with one employer with H1B and I might not be able to switch jobs during the time period.\n\n3. Get Green card because of H1B\n\n4.

        "body": "I have recently relocated to Belgium via a consulting company (they sponsored my working permit), and I'm feeling stuck because I found out that the whole thing is meme.  \nas a developer with +3 years of experience, I feel like the only 'serious' way to build a career, make real money and feel like really doing something is to either become a freelance/independent software developer, or simply look for a company (preferably a company that builds ans sells software) that we find interesting, try to get hired by them and stick there for few years.  \n\n\nI can list many reasons why working for consulting company feels like a joke. \n\n* While looking for a client, I had to deal many and many times with very low IQ Hr people working for the supplier (= direct contact with the client) that had no idea what they're doing or what they're talking about, and I had to act cool and prove to them that I'm a good dog so that they forward my CV to the client. \n* My employer lies about my experience and sends a fake CV with more years of experience, so that he gets a better rate.\n* Most of the clients are proposing opportunities using technologies from the dark ages. And it seems like they outsource these roles because it's impossible for them to find someone to agree to get hired as an internal employee, and work on such projects.\n* While working for the client, there's a constant feeling of 'detachment', they expect the external developer to be involved with the team and project, but the truth is that he's merely a tourist there, and he can be laid off in 24 hours for reasons like budget issues or team organization. \n* Indian consulting companies keep taking the rates down, which makes it very hard to negotiate a decent salary raise in the future.   \n\n\nThis is my first time working for a consulting company, because in the past I worked only for companies that build and sell software(as internal developer). So I'm wondering if  it's the case everywhere in Europe when it comes consulting company , or I have to do a better research before accepting a job?",

Looking for suggestions on whether to take my career path towards MLE vs SWE vs PM\n\nHi! To provide some context, I'm currently an NLP applied scientist. I chose this job because I wanted to get into ML -- however, working with almost all PhDs my imposter syndrome is going through the roof. Also, I've never been very strong in math, I somehow got through college and my masters taking no math classes lol, but my current job assumes a strong basis in linear algebra. I am working in research but I don't like it -- I find it difficult to write papers and come up with new solutions to existing problems. \n\nWhy MLE: I think ML problems are super interesting, but my current AS role is very research focused.  I want to move out of this to hopefully something further away and closer to prod (i.e. what I think is the MLE role). Would my lack of math background be my Achille's heel here as well?\n\nWhy SWE: I did pass HC at Google for SWE a year ago when I was fresh out of college (though I chose not to go b/c of the opportunities in ML) and made it into some other companies, so I think that my interviewing skills for SWE are not too bad. If I will have imposter syndrome forever as long as I'm in ML, going to SWE may not be a bad idea. Another plus is that I enjoy coding.\n\nWhy PM: Honestly not too sure of what the day-to-day of a PM looks like. However, I've actually grew up interested in humanities since I was a child until the middle of college (was always an aspiring writer/journalist), so I think that public speaking and writing are some of my bigger strengths I have that I am unable to use as an engineer. Though I enjoy it, I do not necessarily think coding needs to be part of my job (though I do want to stay in tech) and I think that my past experience in ML and my strengths in writing/speaking may be a plus.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

        "body": "At 30 years old, I recently made the switch to a career in tech. Completed a bootcamp and landed my first junior software dev role a month ago, during my interview I asked about onboarding and training, I was told there would be training.\n\nI got hired at a small start up with a dev team consisting of 3 other people: 1 software architect and 2 other junior devs. The company\u2019s goal is to build a complex social media platform from scratch within 4 months. This first job has been absolute hell. \n\nMy onboarding process was to code a calculator in 4 days using a language and library I have never used before. My code for the calculator was never reviewed lol but the software architect believes that was enough training to now build strong working features for this platform. The problem is the SA has created a toxic environment where questions are answered with sarcasm and condescending tones. There is no structure, no documentation, the SA has no interest and no time to mentor me or spend time going over expectations. The SA is building the platform how he wants so all the code structure lives in his head and he doesn\u2019t particularly care to take time and explain anything to us. I understand he\u2019s in a shitty position where he has to build this huge platform singlehandedly with 3 Junior devs who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\n\nHe\u2019s been in the industry for 20 years and somehow expects us Junior devs to be able to pick up on his code quickly and churn out tickets in these sprints. Some of the tickets are beyond my scope of knowledge or skill. Whenever we have company meetings he always says \u201cI encourage my devs to ask questions\u201d and when I do ask questions it\u2019s met with hostility and impatience, and some rude comments about how annoying I am.\n\nHe spends a lot of time trolling me or the 2 other Junior devs when we take long to complete a ticket or he straight up tries to humiliate me and other juniors during our dev meetings if we make mistakes. He has literally given me an eye roll emoji as feedback. If I try and stand up for myself and explain I am new and still learning, it makes him troll even harder. I don\u2019t feel I am being given the grace to be a Junior dev and to make mistakes without fear of consequence and to learn in a safe environment. I feel like I\u2019m being set up for failure rather than success. I am not looking to be spoon-fed or have my hand held but this has been 4 weeks of insanity. I\u2019m tired of feeling like an incompetent dev, because of the lack of support and structure.\n\nI don\u2019t have a HR department and this is really taking a toll on my mental health. I am stressed all of the time, my anxiety is at an all time high, I can\u2019t ask for help without fear of being judged and ridiculed. I am constantly made to feel stupid. After speaking with peers I realize this is not a normal experience for a Junior dev. I\u2019m trying to stick it out so it doesn\u2019t look bad on my resume but I don\u2019t think I can last much longer in this demoralizing environment. \n\n I don\u2019t know if this is a \u201cgrass is greener on the other side\u201d moment. Any advice is welcome and appreciated. Sorry for the long rant. \n\nTLDR: I\u2019m a junior dev working at a start up with one senior architect who has no interest in explaining anything.

This sub is bigger, and I feel I'll get more advice here than in a more focused sub.\n\nI graduated two years ago, no job applications put out, but I've been trying to force myself to get the hang of web and app development; basically because it's like a foundation for security. I assumed if I want to secure apps, it's best I first know how to build them, but I have no flare for web & mobile app development anymore. It's like I'm forcing myself to do something I'm not interested in. I used to like development a decade ago, but somewhere along the line the passion for it died. I can read code and understand it to an extent and research what I don't, but I don't have that drive to build any sort of web or app-store type mobile app. \n\nInstead of wasting years on a skill I'm not interested in, I'm thinking of diving into the pool I'm truly interested in; security. To be specific, the technical side of it. I'm interested in pentesting, injections, building and understanding scripts/malwares/ITSec-tools, cryptography (love maths), and bug hunting. \n\n- What other technical paths/titles can I pursue in the security field? I'm not really interested in the theories of information & cyber security, but I will read up on theories that I need to. But from going through the security subs, I saw majority of the field rarely works with code. They do so mostly to create tools only. \n\n- Another thing that holds me from going into the general cyber/network security space and kept me trying to master app and web development is freelancing. I'm not really one that enjoys office weekdays 9-5 working. That's more reason why I like penetration testing. I can work from home or as a contractor. So I would like job roles that can allow me freelance or work part time and/or remotely.\n\nBasically, I'm tired of forcing myself to get the hang of web and app development; front end, back end, frameworks, etc. I'm tired of all that - it's annoying just to type and think about. Maybe because of how crowded and diluted the field is, to me. Either way, no desire comes from those topics. I want to transition into something still technical, but not a front-end/back-end based development type job. I loved my cryptography course in school, although hard, it was a challenge I enjoyed. I know I'll love everything technical about cyber & network security. What are my options and paths (especially foundation) please?",

However, for me it's depressing, I've joined the team because I'm truly passionate about ML research (although I don't have a PhD), I haven't touched a DL training for almost a year now, and this new orientation makes me think that I won't for a while.\n\nI'm still young (29y) and even tho I understand that I'm the most qualified for this role, I don't think it's the best way I can expend my career (I'm not THAT technically experienced, most of my decisions are just educated guess and take time plan, I don't have any mentoring, I'm mostly managing interns and juniors).\n\nI also don't think so far that this promotion got converted into title / financial raise (still not senior, even tho I've always been top contributor, and my colleague who stayed in SWE team already got promoted, and because I didn't get promoted my raise last year were imho pretty low).\n\nI'm thinking about asking for a demotion to get back into research (I do think this team is exceptionally good in AI research, so I would prefer not to move).\n\nIs this a suicidal move career-wise? Is there a better solution?\n\nOur raise process is announced in June, I should get promoted senior there (I'm not sure about how much raise), should I wait for it before doing anything?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated.",

Mostly using asp.net and c# as my chosen career. \n\nAs far as my job history goes I've only ever worked for two companies. My first job I was an intern and eventually was hired as a junior. The team was abusive and had a weird power complex situation going on, so I left after 4 years. Plus the company had been dangling the carrot oh money for a while. \n\nThis lead me to my current venture. I'm working for a marketing company and handling five projects that are core operations for the company. I am handling these ony own. I'm the only developer that works on these projects. There are two other devs working in their own projects as well. There isn't a lot of learning or anyone to help guide me career wise, but the culture is phenomenal. Needless to say, I can't grow like I should on my own. \n\nThis lands me on the phone with HR from a new company. I aced the interviews after a year of being told I wasn't good enough for positions, after having interviews with big companies like Microsoft, after being told I'm still junior level and after 6 years that's really bad. I'm taking a position as a lead software engineer with my new company at a 6 figure salary. Under the guidance of a team of 5 engineers as part of a bigger team of 18 engineers. I'm flabbergasted.\n\nIn the words of Rocky:\n\nLet me tell you something you already know. The world ain\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows. It\u2019s a very mean and nasty place, and I don\u2019t care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain\u2019t about how hard you hit. It\u2019s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That\u2019s how winning is done! Now, if you know what you\u2019re worth, then go out and get what you\u2019re worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain\u2019t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain\u2019t you.

And I have many personal projects because of FOMO. \n\nJob:\nI was able to land a developer job right out of school and I asked for a cool 45k because i was getting in person interviews but always rejections so i made myself a bargain, mostly because i like to code, solve problems and make stuff. \n\nThey gave me a starting TC of $65. After my first performance review, where i thought i was being fired, they gave me a raise to TC $78k.\n\nAfter my second, TC of $110k.\n\nMy manager and CTO have said i do good work and i mostly think that\u2019s because i\u2019m just faster than all the consultants (bc im full time of course) as getting products or features to testing and deployment. \n\nQuestion:\nBut how much further will this go? Am i in a position to ask for a raise when they have literally doubled my TC in less than two years? I am very bad at reading people\u2019s emotions and sentiment towards me, which is why after my boss talks in a negative tone i feel like i\u2019m about to get fired, but i think they are generally happy with me. \nI really like working there, and i would like to stay at least until my stuff vests but year two is approaching and i feel like it\u2019s up or out here. I don\u2019t think i can pass some hard core leet code questions, seeing how in this interview they asked me \u201cwhat do you like to do on the weekends\u201d and simple tech questions. \n\nI\u2019m afraid asking for a raise will hurt, I\u2019m not in Frisco, but housing is expensive and I will have to move out soon but i can only afford to live further away from the office (since were returning later this year most likely) and my current commute is about 1-1.5 hours and after working from home I don\u2019t think i want to make that commute. Even though i only live 15 miles from the office.\n\nTL;DR\nI have a liberal arts degree and they have doubled my salary in less than two years. I will need a raise to rent close to the office and not have all my income be directed towards housing. Based on the amount they have increased my salary, i\u2019m not sure it\u2019s appropriate to ask and not sure if i have the credentials to ask for it.",

Last 10 years in a telecom/tech company mostly focused on critical environments and automation (think data centres, etc.). Looking to move into a different part of the company focused on either AI or emerging tech or products/services. I have 3 leads/interviews and wanted to get your thoughts on the pros/cons. Assume salary is same for all the positions and they are all internal transfers. Also, all are manager positions with direct reports.\n\n1. Manage a team of data scientists, software engineers, systems analysts, and business analysts spread over 3 countries to optimize and scale an AI and ML based program to reduce operating costs of the company. So in other words, automate and digitize internal processes and even customer facing troubleshooting (currently done by techs). Team is highly technical, competent, and experienced but lacks direction, role definition, and structure.\n2. Manage a team of business analysts, project managers, and program managers to identify emerging disruptive technologies in smart building and smart cities space for M&A or strategic partnership opportunities. Work is primarily focused on identification and evaluation of technologies and companies so it is pseudo technical with some business analysis. Team would be built from ground up as it is a very entrepreneurial start up environment. \n3. Manage a team of business analysts and product experts to manage product assurance after launch. So this deals with ensuring that my team works with product owners and analytic teams to develop roadmaps, strategies, and tools to increase product assurance for the end customer (general public). This includes physical and digital products (up to 20 product lines).",

        "body": "obviously I would take a paycut to work somewhere like spacex or wolfram research, maybe even work for free (hire me :) !?) but where do you draw the line?  I just took another job within my company.  Big raise.  80k-92k total comp.  I hate it here.  I think the new job could be a fresh start but I still hate the overall corporate culture.  I also have an offer from a company with a web platform and android app to be a jr android engineer.  I got them to come up to 70k in their offer but it's nowhere near what I'm making now.  It's clearly a tech-first culture but I'll be making less.  Who has taken the path of engineering over money?  Do you regret it?",

        "body": "I graduated 3 years ago and worked for revature, that was BS and barely made any money actually went in to debt from having my contract ended short so I had to pay 3 months of rent. Then I went back to college as a research assistant and took out 20k in debt and quit because my car broke down and I told myself i wasn't learning anything and I hated being in school for nothing. I drive for Uber and it is getting old I've been doing it for 9 months the pay has been pretty good but is sort of unreliable long term. I want to build a career and not go through some bullshit company that sells me at a huge markup. I applied to 5 internships and kind of doubt I'll hear back I've heard back from like 3 places in the 2-300 places I applied to since graduating. Are there just a glut of CS majors? I bombed an interview at Amazon because my car just died and I was depressed because I had to leave my ra position. I should've rescheduled the interview because I could've studied the technical stuff some more but when they asked me about how hashmaps store stuff I had no idea so that really hurt me I think. They don't teach algorithms to computer engineering majors at my school. Anyways, what should I do? My brothers a senior software engineer and he's been trying to start a small company with me but wants to work on stuff I have no experience in, I finally feel ready to try taking software seriously again it's just hard to start a company and I think an internship or job might be better for me right now.",

        "body": "I will be graduating next month. My university is in a small city in Canada. Therefore the software companies in my city are very few. I am planning to find job to cities like Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal as there are lot of opportunities. However, I heard from few previous grads, it is difficult to get interviews as companies prefer local candidates to avoid relocating perks or some other reasons. So some people use local address of their friends or family to avoid being filtered as outsiders. As I will be actively looking for jobs next couple of months, I am wondering which way to follow (use my current address or use friends address ). Any information regarding using a fake address and how can I avoid using fake address without getting filtered will be much appreciated.",

        "body": "Hey all! Hope you guys are safe and well.\n\nI'm thinking of getting into cloud computing to become a cloud architect here in Toronto. There are university and college courses offered here but A Cloud Guru caught my eye. I was wondering if there is anyone from Toronto or anywhere in Canada who undergone the process? I really want to become and member and start learning but I'm worried if Canadian companies don't acknowledge A Cloud Guru as a credible program. I've also asked people from LinkedIn specifically about ACG and no one has answered it directly.\n\nAnother question I have is are there any specific career path or hierarchy in this field? I'm looking to research its entry jobs and where it can branch to so I can keep tabs on what I should study in order to grow. So far, I've seen [this](https://www.findcareerinfo.com/cloud-computing-career-path/#Cloud_Computing_Career_Paths) but I haven't seen a job tree like on PayScale.\n\nThank you so much! :)",

They are still asking my friend for the ISA payments in full, which seems a bit unfair.\n\nHas anyone else here had an experience with Holberton like this? Or Lamda and other such training organizations that promise that you only have to pay them back after getting a software job.\n\nThanks!",
