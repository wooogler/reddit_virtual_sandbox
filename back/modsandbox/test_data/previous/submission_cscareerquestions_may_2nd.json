        "body": "I'm a recent computer science grad and I was put in contact with an individual (client) who was looking for someone to develop a small program to help identify interesting trends in stock markets using machine learning. I agreed to help, making it clear that I would only work for it as a side project.\n\nI think it's important to add that this was paid (not that the money was too important to me) and the individual had been \"conned\" before finding someone for this project and I didn't them to feel the same had happened again.\n\nI was told this was a simple program and handed a link to a Github repo with some ML code (although for a different purpose) and told to use this verbatim to build a program for stock markets. As expected, it didn't work out of the box.\n\nI'm repeatedly told by the client that they \"understand\" machine learning and python however I question this. I've been told my approaches (such as using accuracy/f1 scores as metrics isn't important and that modern ML engineers are too \"obsessed\" with analysing results of training/testing data).\n\nI've been working on this project since April but the classifier hasn't been able to learn the training data, but I've been told to not deviate from the code on Github. In my own time, I've experimented with changing this code and achieved better results. The client also wants the program to be simple to run and always produce good results without changing the fine details of the model - I don't think this is possible.\n\nThe client has not been able to run the program on their pc - it cannot find the data files. I have tested it myself and can find no issues on my end, but I suspect the issue is due to the environment from which their python is running from.  I have tried to provide support to help the problem - but was told I shouldn't spend my time on that.\n\nI received a lengthy email yesterday from the client, berating my approach to the development of the program and informed me that in the real world I would have fired for focusing too much on making it possible for them to run the program and for developing code in my preferred IDE rather than the one they specified. Although, I was told that as our working relationship was more casual, it wasn't as much of an issue.\n\nI felt hurt by this email as I've tried my best to work hard on this project, being professional and honest about the limits of my coding abilities. It's made me question my skills and decisions in coding and machine learning.\n\nQuestions::\n\nI'm not looking to continue this working relationship further, but the professional in me wants to provide at least the basic program he requested - given they have had difficulty running the program, is it professional enough to screenshot it working on my system (on their preferred IDE) and not bother helping them to get it working on theirs?\n\nSo far I've been paid for about 9hrs of work. I don't want to be badmouthed as a \"scammer\" like the previous individuals working for them. Should I hand back the money, if the program isn't fully complete?\n\nShould I have developed my code in the IDE of their choice? Should I have at least mentioned I was going to use another? Personally, I didn't see the issue just using another one.\n\nHow should I learn from this going forward? Did I make the right calls?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if this comes off as more of a rant but thanks in advance for any advice/feedback/suggestions. I feel upset and guilty about the situation and really, I don't want to be thought badly of!\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl; dr\n\nFresh grad, side hustle client is difficult to work with and sent an email berating my approach to developing their program.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nE: BTW, I'm in the UK (if that's relevant - ?)

        "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nEverything here is from remote.\n\nI'll just share my experience I'm having right now at a company, it's not a FAANG, but it's a very huge company that probably everyone here knows about it, have a lot of employees and is generally respected.\n\nA little background before, I'm approaching the end of University, but I've been working in the industry since I was 16 y/o, I hopped from job to job and was working part-time in the industry since then without any gap, so I'm coming in this internship with quite a baggage, obviously I don't know everything, but I know a lot of things in the domain I'm in.\n\nI'm joining this team and right off the bat I'm getting some weird vibes, the individuals look friendly, but how they interact with each other, I was scratching my head to determine if I was joining a new formed team in the enterprise or a well-established one. They use Teams for communication and was invited to the team's channel (we are about 11 in the team), but like I was just peeking at what they were saying and it was like extremely formal, I get that at the beginning me and my coworkers don't know each others we have like this wall of professionalism that is maintained and over the course of working together we might bring this down. This team have been working together for 3 years and they still talk like they are sending an email to their superiors to each others! They've been working together for 3 years! Immediately I felt really put off by this weird vibe as I'm a person that likes working, but you know it's fun to actually enjoy working with your team and have friendly banter, share memes, etc... There's was none of it between them, even in group calls no one was talking to each other, nothing.\n\nNow, this feeling they don't like me started from the fact that my superior was explaining to me my project, since I already know most of the technologies, this was fairly straight forward to understand and was basically just noding along, because I was understanding what he wanted me to do. Then he asked me: \"Any questions?\", then I replied that I had none and was ready to go work, then he replied with a weird tone \"Know all the answers, huh?\", I was really confused by that, but replied \"No, it's just that everything was explained clearly I'll let you know if I have any questions for you\" and then we finished the call soon after.\n\nHe was telling me that project should take me about 1 or 2 months, but after 1 week and a half I was already done with it. I gave him multiple notices that I'll be done soon to give him time to either give him time to clear his agenda to review what I did, or to find me something else to do. The last day I pushed everything, he called me telling me my next project. I asked him, what about the last project, I think maybe there could be room to improve and would like comments on certain modules and he just waved off my request to code review by saying \"You know a lot of things, surely there won't be any issues right?\" and I was like \"Sure, but I'd still like some comments, I always have room to improve\" and he just said \"We'll see in a few months\", which in my books with a limited internship time that means fuck off, next project.\n\nI hate this so much, the thing is I think I'm doing the right things and I would've liked to work there after the internship, because it's a huge company that goes well on my resume, but don't know what to do.\n\nTL;DR: Weird formal team vibe, speeding through the project I received, my superior seems to think I'm a pretentious know-it-all, denies me any type of code review, because \"I know a lot\" and just drops me another project on the table to do.",

This book about Rust I'm reading describes systems programming like this:\n\n>Systems programming is for:\n\n* Operating systems\n* **Device drivers of all kinds**\n* Filesystems\n* **Databases**\n* Code that runs in very cheap devices, or **devices that must be extremely reliable**\n* Cryptography\n* Media codecs (software for reading and writing audio, video, and image files)\n* **Media processing** (for example, speech recognition or photo editing software)\n* **Memory management** (for example, implementing a garbage collector)\n* Text rendering (the conversion of text and fonts into pixels)\n* Implementing higher-level programming languages (like JavaScript and Python)\n* **Networking**\n* **Virtualization** and software containers\n* **Scientific simulations**\n* **Games** \n\n**Why I'm interested:**  Not sure about the accuracy of this description, but this all sounds much more interesting to me than the backend webdev path I'd been paying attention to for the last 1-2 years. I have no real world backend experience but from what I've read and heard, most backend jobs are pretty repetitive and \"easy\" in the sense that the difficulty is more about understanding the tools than actually writing the code/business logic.  I used to think a predictable, relatively easy job that pays well was everything I wanted. IDK if it's my ADHD or what, but I've realized I find that type of work incredibly painful, especially if it's for 8 hours a day 5 days a week. I think I'd rather pull my hair out trying to optimize code or find a memory leak than be bored to tears looking at the clock or reading the Spring docs. The inescapable \"pick your poison\" reality of jobs really dawned on me. \n\n**My questions:** What are systems programming jobs really like? What should I do to become a job-ready systems dev?",

        "body": "Hello people of reddit!\nIt's a long, a bit confusing story so bare with me.\nWe're not in the same field so i apologize in advance  for my poor vocabulary and if i use the wrong terms .\nSo we live in Tunisia and the whole system here is very messed up.\n\n\nMy boyfriend has gotten into programming/cybersecurity/ networking since he was 14 or so, and got quite good at it, in fact, my sister is a telecommunication engineer and she tells me he's better than her, and even helps her with complicated projects, so, he started working on small personal projects. \n\n\nAs well as his friends/connections got him small projects opportunities in the web development field ect..\n\n\nAfter getting his technical baccalaureate degree ( he was obligated to study it but he wanted computer science) he needed to study in a private university (they're super expensive) cause with that type of degree you can't go to CS schools. \n\n\nHe studied for 2 year and got the title of network and security system technician and didn't finish his third year so that the degree he gets will be equivalent to a bachelor degree, because the school was shit and wasn't worth the money. \n\n\nHe then started working at a call center as a sys admin and has been working there for 2 years, collected money, and started going to a private engineering school. We heard that the school was great and he was super excited at first but then disappointed in the courses and the level of education but didn't care much cause he needed the diploma in order to seek better jobs opportunities here and gain experience and leave the country.\n\n\n\n Until, one day, they called him and asked to come sign a paper where once he finishes school, he won't demand his \"engineer\" title cause he doesn't have a bachelor degree. WE THOUGHT at first that they were going to make an exception And now they wouldn't explain  what type of diploma he would get, while he's taking engineering classes. it just didn't make sense at all. \n\n\n\nHe's depressed now. \nWe thought about looking for online degrees but they were so unaffordable.\nI told him if he wanted to find jobs abroad he should just apply cause first, he's great at what he's doing and is experienced, second, the diploma doesn't matter that much cause some companies test you for your abilities and the paper doesn't matter that much. (or does it?). But he always tells me that the diploma does matter as well and no company will even offer him a job interview for a diploma of 2 years and that isn't even a bachelor. \n\n\nHe's lost now, and is very depressed cause our system is pretty messed up, and companies here require engineering diplomas, master's ect..\nOr else he'd be working for 300$ a month (if he's lucky enough) \n\n\nSo any idea on what should he do? \n\n\nHe started doubting himself and his abilities, feels like nothing is going right and is slowly giving up. \nIf you have any idea on affordable accredited online degrees, or any advice would really help me. so i can help him with this.",

        "body": "I understand the following might come off as me bragging in the form of a complaint, or might sound like a nonproblem, but I assure you it has been eating away at me.\n\nI recently reached out to my senior developer to ask for a performance review and talk about my career goals. I've been with the company for a little over a year, and during the conversation I also wanted to ask for a raise. The figure I had in mind was around 10k or so, and I thought I would have to fight for that. \n\nThe beginning of the conversation went really well. He gave me both positive and constructive feedback, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. As I was about to move on to the next part and ask him about a raise, I asked him if there was anything else he'd like to add. That's when told me he'd like to work on promoting me, and asked me if I wanted a promotion sooner than later. I was caught off guard slightly, and I told him I don't necessarily wanted to be promoted quickly, but would like a salary bump. But he proceeded to push the idea of a promotion and told me he likes my passion and how much I've been growing. He told me he'd get it going within the next few weeks. \n\nOkay so here's the thing. I don't think I quite deserve it. I think there's still a lot of work I struggle with that I need to improve on, and I have sometime to go before deserving it. The promotion will come with probably a 30-40k salary increase, and that seems like a really big deal. It shouldn't be too different in terms of responsibility, so the issue isn't that I won't be able to fulfill my responsibilities. The problem is more a  mental guilt that this is undeserved and I didn't really work for it. I think my senior dev was just scared of losing me combined with the fact that we have a good relationship and he's a nice guy, so he decided to promote me if I wanted. \n\nAm I overthinking the hell out of this? Should I just be grateful and go along with it? Or should I go back and push the idea of a smaller salary bump while waiting on the promotion?",

        "body": "I have been seeing a lot of hate for gaming companies on this subreddit coming from people who never actually worked in the industry or haven't worked in the industry since early 2000s, and I just want to share my own personal experience of working in this industry and shed some light on it so that other people who might want to do this type of work are not discouraged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have worked in 2 other companies, which would be considered quite big (not FAANG) and I quite enjoyed my time there but that was mostly due to relaxed work environment, and after 4 months I would get quite bored and hate my job since I would be working on a product that I could not care less about. Then I decided to try and work in the Gaming Industry, it seemed like it would be a fun thing to do, so I joined a mid sized Canadian gaming company (\\~300 employees), and now I have worked here for almost a year and will continue working here for as long as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince I was new to the industry, I really was not sure if I should pursue this as my career because of all the negative opinions that I heard about it. So I talked to a bunch of senior engineers who have been in the industry for over 20 years, and the main take away that I got is that this industry changed drastically in the last 10 years and that it has become one of the best work/life balance places to work at if you can pick the right company. Strange right? All I have been told form this subreddit is that it is the worst thing to come out of Software Engineering and you should only work there if work is your life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComparing my current job to the previous ones here is the pros and cons list:\n\nPros:\n\n1. More vacation time, you get about 7 weeks of paid time off and 10 paid sick days. I have never heard of a company in my region giving more than 4 weeks of vacation time.\n2. Better work life balance. Overtime is not allowed unless you get a written permission from your manager. According to other engineers, in the last 4 years there has been only one occurrence of required overtime. It was only for 1 week and it was paid.\n3. Transparency. I am not sure if this is due to the company being relatively small, but the transparency is insane. We are told about all the future projects (even before they are signed), the company shares how much money they made from each game and how much money they still have. Feedback from our games (before release) is shared company wide and not stored in secret for the managers to figure out.\n4. Sense of community and amazing culture. You know that corporate talk and how everyone is super serious all the time and how some companies never seem to have fun? Well this company just feel like a bunch of friends making games.\n5. Constant feedback and freedom to work on what you enjoy. The company actually seems to care about their employees, and tries to constantly improve and be the best company to work for. For example I wanted to work on another project aspect, so my manager started giving me more work items relating to that aspect, easy right?\n6. Zero micromanaging. You work on your own time, and as long as you complete your tasks, nobody ever asks you what you did all day.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Salary. Okay, this is the only one that is true, the salaries are lower, but it is not that bad! In Canada new grad salaries are about 70-85k (unless its FAANG), and gaming industry currently offers 65k. However, after looking into it a bit more, what I gathered is that in 3 years after starting at the company it is pretty normal to have your salary increased to 90k. Which is more than enough to live comfortably, and that's just after 3 years!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, for me I would say it is definitely worth staying in the industry, the paycut is not that big of a deal since even 65k is way more than majority of people get paid in Canada, and I am finally having fun at my job week in and week out. I do work on the engine and network side of things, and do not actually directly work on gameplay. However, if you do want to work on the gameplay side, do know that it is not like working on games on your time since you do not have much creative freedom. For me personally it just seems way more fun to work on a video game and tell people that I worked on this sick game, rather than telling people I worked on an SSD for some corporate company, or some network device that nobody cares about or another SAAS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously this does not apply to every gaming company, but I would say majority of gaming companies in Canada reflect the pros I talked about rather than the cons people talk about on this subreddit (I talked about this a lot with senior engineers)",

        "body": "Hello all,\n\nI am new to this subreddit and found it because I want to advance my CS Career. I am passionate about coding and everything pertaining to computers, and I am currently a freshman in college studying for a Bachelors's in CS. I want to be able to work at big tech firms like Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. one day, hopefully soon, but I also want to be making good money while I am at it. I have been doing a fair bit of my own research as well as consulting with my father who is a DBA in CS and wanted to know what languages I should primarily focus on getting good at to be able to land a job in one of those firms. He told me that machine learning/AI is the way to go these days and I knew immediately Python is really good for ML and AI so I have python on my list for now. I wanted to know the programming languages that these tech firms, specifically Google and Apple look for in a candidate, I also have C++ written down along with Java and JavaScript. I even added Swift to be more favorable to Apple, because I am going, to be honest, I am an Apple shill. I also want to know your guys' insights as to the highest-paid programming language as I have found different sources claiming a different language being paid the highest. I hope you guys can help me with this and thank you so much.\n\nEDIT: I also wanted to know your guys opinion on the math that is associated with a CS degree. I am fairly good at math and passed AP Calc AB with a 3 on the exam. However, when I took stats in college I breezed right through it. The highest level math I have ever done/learned in my opinion js AP Calculus AB. and the only thing that\u2019s scaring me right now for my degree progression is the amount of math courses I will have to complete for my graduation requirements. all the way up to Calc 3 I believe.",

        "body": "For some context, I recently got my first ever SWE job out of college. I didn't do any internships so this is my first real world experience. I am only a few months in and I am already questioning if I should change industries. \n\nMy company is a small custom dev shop in the midwest. We use a stack that I had no experience in starting, and they gave me a week to go through some Udemy courses to get up to speed. \n\nAfter that, they threw me on a project as a lone developer with a PM and QA. The project is over 2 years old and a fixed bid so my company just wanted someone to try and get the client to sign off on the contract. \n\nAfter about a month of working on that, the client is very close to signing off. I have learned a lot about the framework we use and how to go through QA and deploy to Heroku. \n\nThen my company started throwing other projects my way, while that original project was still wrapping up. Just some small fixes to other projects. But once again, I was always a lone developer. We have a code review process, but it is basically just send a PR to another dev on slack and they will leave messages if there are major issues. \n\nThen about 2 weeks ago I got asked to give a bid to a client that wanted a major change to an existing app. It was an app with several thousand users that was built by a different dev shop in town. Except the other dev shop put almost all the data in the same table, causing major issues related to data redundancy and very limited features using such schemea. On top of that, this project was in yet another framework and language I did not have experience in. I basically told my PM that I didn't not feel comfortable giving a bid in a framework I had never worked with. So they set up a meeting with another senior dev who walked through some of it with my. Basically saying we are going to guess a very high number that the client likely won't like. So now I am waiting to hear back if I am going to have to do that project. \n\nCut to today. I am still working on the original project with a nightmare client who will still not sign off on the contract yet. And more small projects keep coming in. Some days I get PMs sending me slack messages to get 3-4 projects done or worked on. And other than reaching out to other developers via slack I am totally alone on fixing these issues. \n\nI was wondering if this is normal? Should I just bite my teeth and grind few the first few months as I am still learning everything? Or should I start finding a new job? \n\nMy issue is it was difficult for me to find a job to begin with, and now quitting after only a few months is not going to help me get another job. But these last couple months have made me hate programming more than I thought I ever would. I feel as though I am not getting any better at programming as I am always fixing small things and asked to do so quickly. Making me rush to get a working solution even if I know it is not the best programming.",

Now it's due in a couple of months and I have no idea if they will grant me a raise.\n\nAlso I wrote a whole bunch of stuff about why I should get a raise and I don't think my manager understood it or listened it it (non technical). I get the impression they will only consider a raise yearly.\n\nI'm not sure what to do to be honest as my current company is generally understanding and flexible and the autonomy is brilliant and well suited to my style of working. However I do think I'm underpaid. I will be bringing it up with my manager (non technical) tomorrow and they were quite defensive last time I asked for a raise. I know it will be awkward because I got rejected last time. I'm not even sure if I want to leave however the new company are asking me to make a decision within 2days!\n\nAny advice please?",

I managed to land a decent job right before COVID struck, but was sent to work from home within the first month and a half. During that time I got approval to learn how to develop macros to streamline the process for inputting data. I ended up writing a number of complicated VBA macros, and doing a lot of self learning on the side. When I was laid off about 8 months ago, I started learning C# on my own full time. I did the beginner, intermediate and halfway through the expert level C# courses by Mosh. I struggled a bit with more of the complicated topics, so I decided upon a grand learning project to solidify all the concepts I had already learned.\n\nIn comes OpenTitration, a fully standalone and automated software package for analyzing titration data ( [OpenTitration Tutorial - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRVPSNFoh8k&t=40s) ). I wrote all the C# code on my own, and invited a collaborator to do some work in python, although all the data science analysis was done by me. I am 30 years old, already have two university degrees (in chemistry) and would like to avoid getting a computer science degree if possible. Back in undergrad I took a minor in applied math, so I have a similar amount of math as a CS major. I also did a lot of data processing during grad school.\n\nI was wondering what are my odds landing a job with my current experience, and if anyone can recommend courses that would help my change of career be a bit smoother.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I graduated this past weekend and have been job hunting for entry-level/new graduate/junior SWE roles since the beginning of the year with little progress. I got some call-backs and even got to the technical portions of the interviews but never made it past that. Recently, I got invited to go into the final round of interviews with a health care company for a newly graduated Systems Analyst position. I have read on this sub that the position is just a title and the work depends on what company it's for, but this position is basically to automate some redundant internal tasks like setting up servers and whatnot. When I asked about the possibility of career growth in terms of coding, I was informed I would only be coding some scripts for maybe 30% of the time, while the other 70% of the time would be focusing on \"other things,\" whatever that means? My ultimate goal in this job search is to look for experience that I can be transferrable to my next potential job, which I\u2019m unsure this Systems Analyst position can provide given the description.\n\nI want to be able to eventually work as a developer, but I have been hearing that taking a Systems Analyst role would make me rusty when it comes to programming and ultimately I should just focus on applying for SWE positions. That\u2019s great and all, but the problem is I\u2019m not sure if I should pass up on this offer; that is if I get past this final round. Maybe it\u2019s imposter syndrome, but I feel as though my coding skills aren\u2019t where they should be as a new grad, especially because I wasn\u2019t able to land any internships while I was still in school, which I regret. I have some interesting class projects keeping my resume afloat and plan to keep tweaking them just to teach myself new things, but I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019ll be enough as well. I also still plan to grind Leetcode problems, take Coursera courses for certifications and apply to other SWE positions until I hear the final decision for this Systems Analyst position, but I am feeling anxious. I keep thinking that it\u2019s too soon in the job hunt to accept the first thing that comes my way, but at the same time when will that next interview come around?",

        "body": "Hey guys. My coworker and I were discussing different ways of handling delegating work, estimates etc. and how other companies/projects that we've been on do it. Here are our thoughts, and I'd love to hear what you guys think/have experienced.\n\nRight now we are doing kanban style boards. There is a big list of backlog items. We don't really spend a lot of time on estimates - that ticket looks like it'll probably take 4 hours, so we put 4 hours. There are no sprints. You finish a ticket, you move on to the next. So it's structured-ish in the sense that we do have things to do... but it seems never-ending, and like we're always in crunch mode. Whereas we have both been in a company or on a project where they did agile/sprints - we have to get x features done in the next 2 weeks. This feels more manageable because a ticket might have been estimated to take 4 hours, but it took us 6 - that's ok, the estimate wasn't super accurate. Or a ticket might have been estimated to take 6 hours, but it took us 4 - now we're ahead and we don't have to work as hard on the next ticket because we have an extra 1-2 hours on it. It also gives us an \"end\" (the end of the sprint), if that makes any sense. Our current kanban style just feels like it'll never end, and it feels like we're going to burnout a bit. I recognize that realistically the work doesn't actually end after 2 weeks in sprints/agile - but it still \\*feels\\* better to have that structured end.\n\nHow does your guys' companies do it?

I previously worked at a different company in the Financial Services industry in the same role in the EPMO department. \n\nI started at my current company in January 2020. I referred my previous coworker (through my current company's referral app, so her application is tied to my name) to apply for my same exact job (we have several openings). Her and I both started in our roles at the previous company within 2 months of each other. We both have unrelated bachelors degrees, I have an MBA and the CBAP certification. (Like the PMP for Business Analysts). \n\nIn her initial interview, the HR representative quoted her a salary range that, at a minimum is like $30 more per year than I'm currently making, and at its maximum is 20k more than I am currently making. If she were to receive an offer for more than I am making, it would bother me knowing that as I have more education and more tenure with the company with otherwise completely equal experience. (Literally our previous company and position and the types of projects we worked on were the exact same). \n\nIs it reasonable to try to request a pay increase based on this information should she accept an offer at a higher salary than me? They should not be surprised that I know her offer details as I am her referring employee and they legally cannot prevent us from discussing pay. That just seems ridiculous to me that they'd pay a new hire with less qualifications more than someone who has been there for over a year. However, I don't know if this is considered a legitimate reason for asking for a pay raise. We are in the process of waiting on our FY 21 performance reviews and I anticipate getting our highest rating. I consistently get great feedback from my peers and superiors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for your help!",

I'm expecting another round of interview anytime now. If i get the IT consulting offer I'm afraid both offers will clash and i really dont have any idea about the conversion process (I'm assuming they'll ask me to sign something). \n\nMy current manager has said that he is expecting me to stay in the company if converted (nothing signed, just verbal between manager and employee) and that he's pulling some strings to get me a permanent position. I dont want to commit to my current company for a dev role before i get the decision of the IT consulting job. Would I be burning bridges or creating some problem if I revoke my verbal commitment if i get the other job ?\n\nPS The current people are really nice and helpful and i learnt a lot from them.

My eventual goal is to land a database developer position related to primarily data warehousing and I have been studying independently since COVID hit. I have attended university as a comp sci major for two years but never finished due to reasons both within and out of my control, so I understand that reaching such a position would require demonstration of competency suitable for such a role along with the certifications to prove it (working on Oracle 071, AWS Solutions Architect Associate, and possibly Snowflake Snowpro Core). \n\nOnto the substance of my question, I'm presented with a dilemma where I can:\n\n* choose to work part time (prob only 20-25 hrs a week) that pays well in a completely unrelated field that allows me time to essentially be a fulltime student with the materials I have been using to study thus far\n* or work as an IT intern getting paid $12/hr doing 40hr weeks, allowing me significantly less time to study on my own terms\n\nMy concern with the latter option is that while it is much more closely related to my eventual position, the internship is for a purely IT focused company where I wouldn't necessarily be able to learn anything related to my end goal. Personally, I feel confident enough in my ability to study independently to continue working towards my certs so I'm leaning towards the former option but I'd imagine that many other developers in the field that I eventually want to reach have started from IT positions so I want to get a second opinion on the matter since I feel that I may have some bias preventing me from making an objective decision.

However, I did not have a ssn card (believe it was thrown away by a cleaner, at a previous home at the beginning of covid), but I figured a passport would suffice. I ordered my social security replacement card in March, however, there was a mistake and I had to resubmit it. The SSN office told me the earliest it would ship to me is July. \n\nMy boss said I would have 90 days from the start date to supply the card if i have the receipt, but only if I have the receipt, which the receipt takes upwards of 2-3 months just like the replacement card itself. So i'm hoping that my card will come before then. I have a temporary ssn card, and i'm still waiting back to see if that will suffice. But I'm worried, wouldn't I not get paid until I can supply my ssn card since it's for the I9? \n\nI'm nervous that the job offer will be revoked because in the offer letter it says if I don't have all my required qualifications, I.E graduation, pre employement onboarding passport + ssn card within a few days of my start date the offer could be withdrew. But when speaking with my boss that sounds like that's not the case. \n\nI'm awaiting a final email response tomorrow, essentially how big of a problem this is. Is it common to get a job offer revoked because of situations like this? Am I screwed?",

The team I'd be on, works with a company that starts with \"I\", ends with \"L\" and makes processors.  \nHowever, in going through their paperwork, they have a very ambiguous non compete form. It lasts for a year after my employment, and says I can't \"provide services of  a similar nature\" to any \"direct competitors or clients of Employer\".  It also says \" This will apply within the Restricted Territory: the jurisdiction you are currently working and anywhere that the client works.\" Pretty ambiguous.\n\nI've asked them for clarification, and am waiting to hear back, but I'm wondering if maybe I should keep hunting elsewhere. Also, the pay isn't spectacular (50k in the US). Only thing that sucks is I already put in my notice to leave at my old job, so I'll be out of a job.

        "body": "I've been working at a .NET shop for most of my career, which is admittedly not very long compared to most of you, and I'm a little older and got off to a later start than I should have. It hasn't really been the best job in terms of pay or excitement. The tech stack is all .NET, but using older technologies like WinForms and WCF services. Despite that, I really enjoyed working with the people on my team and that was enough to keep me around. My company was bought out recently, and while I was given a promotion and a pay raise, most of those people I really enjoyed working with are gone now for one reason or another. I realized I can't remember the last time I genuinely enjoyed my work here, so I feel like it's probably time for me to move on as well, but I'm not having a lot of luck.\n\nI'm not very familiar with web-based stuff beyond some light personal tinkering with Angular and react, although nothing that would make me confident enough to mention it in a job interview. I've more recently become fairly adept (probably only in my own opinion) at replacing our old services at work with REST APIs in .NET 5, but that's probably the closest thing to a modern skill that I have.\n\nI'm finally in a place where I can afford to take a paycut to try and start over, but just about every .NET job listing makes me feel like a failure with their requirements for 5+ years of Javascript and React and/or Angular. I'd love to get into it because what little of it I've seen is very interesting, but between my current job and family life, I don't have a lot of energy to spare with trying to teach myself on the side. I feel like my only hope is to get a new job where I can really jump into it full time and to be around others more knowledgeable than myself so I can ask a lot of questions. \n\nAre there any back-end oriented jobs out there where I can get my foot in the door working on APIs, or am I stuck where I'm at and trying to learn what I can with only a few minutes a day to spare? I keep joking that I'm just going to apply to Taco Bell instead, but it sounds like less and less of a joke every time I say it.",

        "body": "I originally made a post 27 days ago on April 19th 2021 asking when to throw in the towel with job searching. It was one of the lowest days in my life. I had let pity creep in and I felt I was putting in too much work with no reward. I was a day away from giving up.\n\nHere is the original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/muh32a/when\\_to\\_throw\\_in\\_the\\_towel/gv5xidr/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/muh32a/when_to_throw_in_the_towel/gv5xidr/)\n\nA few Redditors stepped in and gave me some much-needed words of encouragement and convinced me it was just the nature of the game and to just keep at it. [u/abv281](https://www.reddit.com/u/abv281/) I'll never forget you.\n\nI am proud to say I landed my dream job just a few days after making the original post. It was about a month-long process, and I formally accepted the offer today.\n\nBut that's not my intent of this post. This post is here to act as a reminder to the ones currently trying to land their first job. I know exactly how you are feeling, and it's normal, we've all been there.\n\nI want you to think of your job search like this:\n\nImagine you had a little tea light candle and it's in a pile of branches. Eventually one will catch, you just need to worry about keeping your tea light lit. Just don't give up. Everything worth anything in life is hard to get. It will be one of the most rewarding feelings you experience, I promise.\n\nBe open to receiving advice from strangers on the internet, but also realize some of that advice is just that, from strangers who don't know your exact situation. I have had loads of good advice, but also loads of bad advice. I don't think it's anyone's intent to give bad advice, but you will come to find out, people are very opinionated. You'll eventually be able to gauge what's good and what's not good for your situation.\n\nI think we all know how people feel about the interview process. It's pretty polarizing, but learn to play the game. Once you learn how to play the game, it gets significantly easier. Just hammer hacker-rank and leetcode problems until you know them inside and out, eventually that gets fun because you naturally get better the more you do. Read cracking the coding interview, I CAN'T STRESS this enough. These things will help build your confidence for when you get your chance to shine.\n\nLastly and most importantly, stop doing funky sh\\*t with your resumes. I know YOU think they look good and innovative. But, I will be first in line to tell you it's a bad idea. I am a front-end dev, so I figured I would make my resume all clean and minimal. I don't think I received one callback from any of those resumes. The content didn't change much, just the way I presented it. Stick to the basics, there are tons of posts on Saturdays about resumes in this community. LISTEN TO WHAT THEY TELL YOU! As soon as I spent the time to revise my resume to the industry standard, I was getting callbacks, not tons, but finally was getting the call-back.\n\nHave fun with this process, I know it gets extremely frustrating at times, but it's 100% possible with the right amount of work and a little bit of luck. Don't let life pass you by, things will work out, you'll figure it out, or else you wouldn't be where you're at today. My inbox is always open to younger candidates looking for advice.\n\nThank you for everything r/cscareerquestions!",

        "body": "This is my manager's first time being a manager. We are an engineering team of 9 people, 2 are founders. My manager isn't a founder. Here are some of the things I've had to deal with:\n\n\\- When I was first hired my manager said I could change our version control from SVN to git. This process took over 6 months to do, not because it was a hard technical change, that was the easy part, but because one founder was so not cool with needing to learn git for the first time and we had to painstakingly get his buy in every step of the way.\n\n\\- I was told I could add React to our frontend when I was first hired. It's been over 2 years and I've had every proposal dismissed as totally dead in the water because the same founder has never used React and doesn't want to learn it.\n\n\\- The same founder lost 8 months of work because he claims he accidentally wiped his hard drive twice. He did this twice.\n\n\\- One week before we needed to ship a project I was leading for 2 months, the founder didn't respond in slack for over 48 hours. He requires that he review all of my code before we ship. I had to escalate on the last day before we shipped to the CTO to say we were at risk. The founder magically appeared in seconds ready to review my code and I somehow still shipped on time.\n\n\\- Normally, I would think a coworker being MIA for 2 days was because of a crisis, but he regularly just doesn't show up to work. He never explained why he dipped. No one in leadership said they would talk to him or even said \"that wasn't ok\". We all just know that he does this.\n\n\\- My opinion is never genuinely factored into any code change. It's always whatever this founder wants ultimately. I've explained this to my manager as being undesirable and he said \"you need to reach alignment\" which we both knew meant \"just agree with him\"\n\n\\- My manager followed all of his subordinates on Instagram, which I saw as wildly unprofessional (it's not like I can really not accept a follow request from my manager) and then randomly unfollowed me in December.\n\n\\- My manager hired a known transphobic guy to our team knowing a trans woman I worked with didn't want to work with this person. That trans woman quit shortly after.\n\n\\- My manager allegedly (according to the trans woman I worked with) went to a concert with her, a coworker, by themselves and bought her flowers. He is married with two kids.\n\n\\- The founder and that transphobic guy had a yelling match in a meeting for 2.5 hours in a 1 hour scheduled meeting. The transphobic guy was fired. The founder wasn't. I was never pulled aside by leadership and told that this kind of meeting behavior is not ok.\n\nI've seen over 20 people quit within two years at a \\~50 person company. Everyone hates working with this founder, it's not personal and it's not just me. I am exhausted though. I really, really like working with basically all other coworkers expect for these two. I like the company mission. I just hate feeling completely unsupported by my manager and working with a founder that's like this. Any ideas on how best to cope with this or ways I can somehow make this situation less awful?",

        "body": "I recently started as a contractor at Facebook as an engineer about a month back. \n\nOnboarding has been pretty terrible - yes they have an internal wiki and everything is decently documented, but actually performing day-to-day duties on a team and trying to get up to speed remotely is very difficult. I have not received much help from my colleagues even though I've asked multiple times, I understand that they are busy and it is not on them to train a contractor. I have asked for periodic code reviews, shadowing their work, as well as expectations and feedback of my current work, but have received little to nothing. I'm due for on-call soon and haven't even been brought up to speed on our ecosystem, and am super worried that I'll crash and burn when the time comes and be blamed, even though I've tried to be the squeeky wheel that asks for helpm\n\nI'm dealing with a new manager who started the same time I did. I understand that he is onboarding to this team, but he has been around the company for multiple years as well. He is very difficult to ask questions or ask for any sort of support and resources. I have asked multiple times for basic context and help in some areas, but for the most part I've had to figure out everything on my own which has been super frustrating. \n\nI mentioned this to the staffing agency that I work through, and they sent an email to the director who sent an email to my manager and then my manager pulled me into a meeting and bitched me out for going above him about the issues I'm having. \n\nNot really sure where to turn for help or how to approach the situation. It's a 6 month contract and I'd like to finish that out. How do I best smooth things out with my manager, or 'manage up' as they say? How should I set my expectations as well as judge and monitor how I am performing without any feedback? \n\nLooking back, I don't think I've ever had such a terrible onboarding experience as well as a terrible manager. It makes the day to day very difficult, especially when I want to do a good job and hopefully get a full-time position at FB.",

        "body": "Hi,\n\nI am a 24 year old software developer working at SAP bangalore, India with a very average salary and right now i am in a midlife crises type of situation. All my friends are either already in US working at good companies or are going for MS by 2021/2022 fall, therefore around 80% of my fiends will leave india by 2022, and rest have switched companies 1-2 times and are at a very good package right now. \n\nHere i am just thinking what i want to do, to be honest since the beginning of 2021 i have this entrepreneurial spirit inside me. In jan end I became an amazon seller and slowly slowly by march actually I started earning decent amount through it though my items are limited and seasonal but then because of lockdown orders have stopped, along with that i have gained a lot of interest in stock market and have been studying a lot about it as well, during office hours i am more interested in looking at charts rather than office work. I also love to cook so have a dream of my own restaurant as well one day.\n\nSo the issue is , i am able to do this only because SAP is chill work wise and because of the work from home policy, the moment that gets over my side activities will take a pause and even if we ignore that, though i am very interested in both the side things which i started and wish to increase their level, but its very much possible that they either remain a passive source of income or after some time i get frustrated and decide to end both of them because everything is exciting in beginning, and if this happens 1-1.5 year down the lines, i would be a 25-26 year old developer still at that average job , not achieved much whereas all the people i know would be way ahead of me and probably would be too late for me then and i may regret not going for MS when i had the time.\n\nI had a 9.5+ cgpa in my cse btech so all of my friends really push hard and encourage me to pursue MS, but to be really honest i am not that interested in studying, i have the fascination of living outside india but sudying i am not so sure and more over i suck at algo ds, i even started studying algo ds around feb so that i can try to switch but i truly have 0 interest in that so i kind of only did it for less than a month. So my fear is even if i complete my degree and then i am not able to crack an interview there , then it will be even more messed up because i will have loan on my head.\n\nThere is a possibility that after going into the college i start liking the things that are taught there and really get into it but will lose on the current opportunity, because with SAP i can truly experiment on lot of other things in life, so i kind of have a stable source of income and can work on side things as well which a person cant do at a later stage of life when he has more responsibilities on his head.\n\nI am not sure which path to continue and any suggestions will help a lot.\n\nAnd thanks a lot for taking out time to read such a long Post.",

        "body": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI was trying really hard to find a job since the beginning of my Masters. I was not able to land an internship. But I got to work on a really interesting project with a professor at my school. I worked on it for 8 months and was able to resolve one of the major problems of their product. It reduced the operational cost by 40%, removed dependency on external software which was charging money. Along with that, I was able to interface a UI over the web (like being able to interact with a VM using a GUI). There were a lot of other components in the project which involved pricing strategies, application monitoring and he even wanted a conversational AI for the users.\n\nI took a judgment call in developing the infrastructure of the product before adding the other features. The professor wanted me to continue working on the product even in my final semester. But due to health issues and the need to find full-time employment weighed heavily on my mind, so I declined.\n\nI used to frequent this subreddit and saw people post getting jobs after applying to 700+ companies. On the other hand, I did not even apply to 200 companies. I applied using referrals and still was not considered for an interview. This all affected my mental health which caused me to stop applying altogether.\n\nOne of the hiring managers from the big tech saw my profile on LinkedIn, was interested in me, and set up an interview with me. Long story short after 5 rounds of interviews. \n\nThe great thing is that I will be working with a team that is trying to build a similar product but at a much larger scale, and involving physical machines as well. \n\nAlso due to my experience, instead of offering me a new grad offer, they bumped me to a higher level.\n\nI having trouble thinking about whether I am good enough, could I have done better, Was I just lucky in landing this job.\n\nWhat are some tips the senior developers would give someone starting out new?\n\nAlso, do I need to work with the professor again to complete the unfinished components?  i don't think he would be vindictive, but is there a possibility of me losing this job because I did not finish everything that was asked of me ?\n\nTLDR: I found a great job in one of the big tech companies on the basis of an interesting project I did as a Research Assistant.

He is considering going back to school for computer science, preferably to land a job in IT/cybersecurity (he's not quite sure yet). We both currently work FT to support our family of 3. We are not in a position right now for him to quit his job to attend school FT and his employer will pay for 2 courses a semester currently.\n\nWe live in Florida where we have a major university that offers an all online B.S. in Computer Science program. The problem is that there are lots of pre-reqs he would have to take in order to enter the program, including a foreign language. Which he would have to quit his job in order to take since they are not available online.\n\nSo, he is considering a local community college that offers an A.S. in Computer Science and Web Development. The coursework includes C++, Java, and SQL either on an intro or intermediate level (it is community college after all, so no 3000/4000 level coursework). It is a 60-credit hour program.\n\nHis concern is this: will an A.S. be good enough to land a job? Most jobs we look at require a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. But typically Bachelor's programs consist of 60 hours of general education (english, humanities, science, etc) and 60 hours of program coursework (major specific). If he has a Bachelor's in something else and then gets an A.S. in Computer Science, is that still viewed favorably or almost equal? \n\nThe goal is to get into this field, work with a State employer for a few years to gain the experience and then move into the private sector.

        "body": "Hi all!\n\nI frequent this subreddit often and the general consensus seems to be that govt jobs are low-paying and hard to acquire. On the advice of a recent thread I decided to look at these jobs anyway and they seem ...normal?\n\nFor instance there are several GS-12+ jobs outside major cities that pay $76,721 to $109,358 per year with the only requirement being:\n\n\"One year of appropriate specialized experience equivalent to at least the GS-11 level in the Federal service that demonstrates accomplishment of computer project assignments that required a wide range of knowledge of computer requirements and techniques pertinent to the position to be filled. \"\n\n\n\nThere are a few GS-09 jobs with even lower requirements!\n\n\nIt looks like any dev that's had 2-3 of years industry work would qualify? And an upper-5-figure salary in a mid-sized town in, say, Oregon isn't bad at all. Throw in benefits and the stability of govt work and it sounds like a great deal.\n\n.\n\nSo I feel I must be missing something here. Is the hiring process very stringent for those coming from the private sector? Are the technical/onsite rounds insanely difficult? Or is it something else entirely?",

I know I royally messed up, and regardless of if I get fired or not, just wanna own up to the mistake and grow from it. \n\nHello, I\u2019m really in need of some advice. \n\nI really messed up and told my coworker/mentor during our scrums that I was making progress on a small function/class that needed to be added before we started testing the entire app. It honestly could have been done in a day or two by my mentor but I extended the story points by 5 days since I\u2019m very inexperienced. (This is my very first SWE job, 5 months in, no internship, no experience with Java at all but was expected to learn it immediately, which I was initially fine with) \n\nBut I ended up getting completely lost with how to even build and run the project as I wasn\u2019t used to the build system and was missing all these other dependencies. On top of that, I spent too much time trying to understand the existing code and Java. \n\nI was coding features prior to this project in C++ without too much struggle (still taking a lot of time but to ensure my code is properly reviewed), so I thought after getting that experience with a lot of good feedback, I could transfer over to this without too much worry but I feel even more confused.\n\nAnd now my mentor/team thinks I\u2019m done with my task when I\u2019m not and I\u2019m not sure how to bring it up. I understand I\u2019m now setting back the progress and I feel extremely guilty. I should have asked for as much help as I could, but I kept pushing it back until days past and felt I still couldn\u2019t ask for help. Additionally, I possibly feel I\u2019m not as motivated as I should be. It\u2019s hard to be productive when I can\u2019t figure anything out and I\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of anxiety from all of this. (Sounds very common of this sub but I\u2019m also part of the club that thinks that I\u2019m maybe not cut out for SWE) \n\nI was planning on telling the truth tomorrow about the progress and hoping to get advice from both my boss and mentor on how to better prioritize my tasks, since I\u2019m still going over the estimates a lot. But I\u2019m not sure how to bring up the part about being unmotivated and my personal issues with anxiety.",

        "body": "Some general info: I\u2019m a 29YO developer from the Midwest with 3.5 years of professional development experience. I have a bachelors degree in Information Systems. I don't mind any one side of programming but the front end is definitely my vibe. \n\nMy last development job I was hired to be an analyst. The position turned into a full stack job in which I worked for two years. I left that company September 2020 to find something new as the culture was incredibly toxic and I hit my limit (local gov job). I did not have a another job in place. \n\nI ended up accepting a job for a VB/ASP developer after a 3 month search through a very reputable recruiting firm. \n\nThe outfacing culture of the new workplace is much better, but that is about it. I\u2019ve been in the new position for 5 months now and i\u2019m seeing some things that are troubling. \n\n- The job is different then what was expressed in the \ninterview. More specifically what systems of the company I would be working in. Also the entire front end of our client facing site is outsourced which was not communicated with me prior to accepting.\n\n- There is no programming lead/director. The department has two managers and neither have much experience with development.\n\n- Zero onboarding for new developers. - It was a quip document made on the fly by one of the devs \u201ctraining me\u201d. \n\n- The codebase is an absolute nightmare. This company is mid size but they have developed very complex processes to handle all of the unique requirements from vendors. All of this code lives in one 350k+ line solution.\n\n- The codebase has 0 documentation. The dev that is training me (30+ years in the industry) said he had to learn the codebase by single stepping this massive solution. \n\n- The testing environment has data from 2016 because for whatever reason the test database cant be refreshed?\nAll of the devs in the company (about 13) have all worked here for a very long time and tend to be very silod in their work so it\u2019s really hard to tell who is working on what. \n\n- There is 0 accountability for any management or developers here so big decisions on projects and stack changes hardly ever get made and when they are brought up, get shunned by the dev team. The management has to rely on these devs for this kind of advice having little programming knowledge themselves. \n\nI\u2019m very segregated working with the senior dev who is training me (He came on a year before me and struggled with alot of the same issues as me(he has 30+ successful years as a developer).\nMost of that time is spent going back and forth about the issues and problems on the team and with management. I expressed my frustration a few times in that I was thinking about looking around again and he flat out told me \u201cyou need to put some time into a company. iIt\u2019s not good to keep hopping around job to job so frequently. That will really hurt you\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m considering my options but the quote the senior guy gave me gives me some pause. \n\nWe just got assigned a new multi year project to convert a series of old FOX programs the dev team has been dodging for years. Getting any assistance for the beginning of the project has been like pulling teeth. \n\nThere really is no light at the end of the tunnel that I can see. \n\nI want to be in the front end. I was told there would be some opportunities for that here but it seems to be going the opposite direction. \n\nI\u2019m considering using the company Udemy account to sure up some front end frameworks while I look for something else.\n \nMy mental and attitude has sharply decreased with each month. Should I just stick it out for experience sake or try and find a better fit? \n\nThanks for reading. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",

        "body": "I've been interested in Software Engineering/Cyber Security for a while now. I've noticed through introspect that when I'm learning things I actually want to understand and am interested in when I study on my own terms and do it my way, I feel much more invested, determined and actually **care** about what I'm learning if that makes sense? Instead of getting put into classes and told how to receive information like a bot. For some reason it makes me extremely attention-deficit and here's the sad part:\n\n**My Embarrasing Backstory:**\n\nIt's time to be honest with you guys. I need you to know this about me. It tells you who I am. I spent **2 years** trying to past my \"1st year\" if that makes sense. I failed almost every subject for 2 years in a row. My GPA is at like 0.8 or something. Can you believe that? I have no excuses. I was lazy. I ended up on academic probation, I even had to write a huge letter about how I'll try better if they give me a second chance. Well they did and guess what? I was joking myself. I tell myself these lies I know just won't conjure up to reality. I decided It's time to stop lying to myself. It's time for me to do this, the pragmatic, hands on way like I've always been known works for me.\n\n**My Determination:**\n\nI have 0 coding experience, really nothing. I'm just a 21 year old noob from Australia who wants to make this happen one way or another and I've realized University isn't for me. I'm planning to buy a bunch of books tomorrow. I live with my parents, have no pressure to move out either. My plan is to pick up a part-time/full time retail job or something for some money and spend my days at home to really dive deep into learning to program and understand computer science fundamentals on my own. I didn't drop out of University for shits and giggles, I really mean this.\n\n**My Worries:**\n\nI'm not sure if I am making the biggest mistake of my life or the most beneficial, I can only know what I know at 21. I am no wizard, I am not the sharpest tool in the shed. Hell, to be honest with you? I barely know my 3x table. But right now, this seems to be the best decision that is really going to work for me. Perhaps I'll pick up where I left off with my degree, which was, basically nothing anyway. Or I'll leave it altogether. All I know is that being in your early 20's is about taking risks right? At least that's what I tell myself.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nI wanted to know what information you guys could share with me. Any hidden tips that I may likely miss out on that you learned through your self-programming experience. I'm interested to hear your stories and things that have helped you get to where you are today. Thank you.",

Its very well paid, with good work life balance and flexibility and all that. However, you can do the job for ten years only. After that you need to rise up the ranks and become a chief technology officer or something like that or create your own company. Only very few people are ever able to be a CTO or start a successful company. Companies also don't hire anyone over 40 years of age, because they wouldn't usually be up to date with the latest software technology and someone younger knowing the latest tech could be brought in for half the salary. Even designers and company founders, he has seen no one above 40 years of age. \n\nBut for people who want a stable career throughout their working life for 35 years or so, software development is not a good career track at all. \n\nThis is not this person's views only.

I have been teaching myself to code over the last \\~year, starting initially with Python before moving on to C# about 9 months ago.\n\nAlongside some smaller projects and studying (I am about to finish a course which will give me an [HNC in Computing](https://www.whatuni.com/advice/choosing-a-course/what-is-a-hnd-and-a-hnc/2116/)), I have built one larger, more complex project which I have [put onto GitHub](https://github.com/131U3blue/ExifDataReader). \n\nI feel like this project is what I'm mainly hanging my CV on - it's an EXIF (photo metadata) parser which also works with Flickr's API to download several images and print out their metadata onto the conole. It's still a work in progress with a few bugs to fix up, but some of the key features include:  \n\n\n* Async/Await when downloading images from Flickr\n* Dependancy injection to be able to parse byte arrays regardless of whether they're Big Endian or Little Endian\n* Reflection to find all types that implement a specific interface (this helps to identify main segment markers within an image's byte array)\n* Replaced byte arrays with Span<byte> to improve performance\n\nThis was intended to only be a small project, but it turns out that the EXIF spec isn't as simple as I thought - a lot of the metadata can be nested/offset, and each segments can vary wildly in size.   \n\n\nSo my question is, with no CS degree (I have a first class degree in music, which I'm downplaying as I know it's hugely unrelated!) am I in a realistic position to get a job?",

        "body": "Hey guys, \n\nI'm an undergrad coming to the end of sophomore year right now. I'm currently taking two intro CS classes because I'm considering a CS degree. The first half of the semester was really fun, and I recognize that I felt it was fun because I was in a flow state ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow\\_(psychology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))), ie. the coding challenges were difficult and pushed me to my limits, but were still doable so that the accomplishment of getting the code right felt so fucking rewarding. \n\nFast forward to this week. I just received a 50% on last week's coding assignment, and the deadline for this week's assignment is in 22 hours, and I haven't even started. I'll be honest, I'm bad at consistency, and halfway into every semester, I lose motivation and can't seem to maintain a healthy lifestyle while keeping up with my studies. However, I've been able to do well in other subjects like the social sciences and humanities (just for context, I have a 3.9 GPA \u2014 although this might change after my CS classes) because I'm pretty good at cram studying for exams and doing work last minute. Consistency isn't important in  humanities, but it seems to be integral to CS and STEM subjects. \n\nAs a result, I've been thinking about what I like about learning CS and what I don't. \n\nWhat I like: \n\n\\- I'm getting important 21st century knowledge that gives me access to previously inaccessible spaces, like employment, culture, and general life options\n\n\\- I feel challenged in a way I've never felt before. \n\n\\- I genuinely feel excited learning about CS. \n\n\n\nWhat I don't like: \n\n\\- No time to rest. Once the semester starts, you can't put a pause on your studies or reflect on what you learned. You have no control over your life for a couple months (or at least that's my experience). \n\n\\- So many math prerequisites...\n\n\n\nIt seems to me that the structure of university classes just isn't conducive for me to learn CS, which brings me to my question. I want to know whether there are certain skills that a CS university education can give you, that a CS bootcamp (or online courses) cannot. Obviously, there has to be a lot \u2014 I mean, a few months of intensive learning definitely cannot compare to four years of education. To my understanding, a bootcamp focuses solely on coding, but a CS degree teaches you a lot of theory. But due to my ignorance, I don't know what the actual usefulness/practical application of CS university courses (theory or not) is, so please enlighten me.  \n\n\n\nBtw, I know a bootcamp also cannot be paused midway, but I feel like a couple months of no control is better than two years (from where I am now) of no control.\n\nEdit: I can see the limitations of a bootcamp - it\u2019s definitely just the beginning of the learning process for bootcampers. It sounds like a lot of people see university as the best path to becoming a software engineer, which is probably true, but what if someone just really isn\u2019t compatible with the structure of university? Are there alternative options, or am I just gonna be in perpetual disadvantage if I don\u2019t major in CS? Any success stories from non CS majors?",

For example, one such result might look like this: \"Frank Jones - North America - 2500\" The exact display format is unimportant for this exercise.\"\n\nMy answer: \n\n\"`SELECT *`\n\n`FROM department`\n\n`join sales_agent ON department.department_id = sales_agent.department_id`\n\n`join sales_record ON sales_agent.agent_id = sales_record.agent_id`\n\n`order by amount desc;` \"\n\n\"Question: Extract names from objects that exceed 2000 , and average sale for all employees.\n\n{ \n\n\"Results\": \\[ \n\n { \"Name\": \"Frank Jones\", \"Department\": \"North America\", \"Sales\": 2500 }, \n\n{ \"Name\": \"Sally Smith\", \"Department\": \"North America\", \"Sales\": 2200 }, \n\n{ \"Name\": \"Ed Kramer\", \"Department\": \"Europe\", \"Sales\": 1700 }, \n\n{ \"Name\": \"Susan Johnson\", \"Department\": \"Asia\", \"Sales\": 2000 } \n\n\\] \n\n}\n\n`let extract = (obj) => {`\n\n`let averagePrice = 0;`\n\n`let names = [];`\n\n`let arrayOfPeople = obj[\"Results\"];`\n\n`arrayOfPeople.forEach(el => {`\n\n  `(el[\"Sales\"] > 2000) ? names.push(el[\"Name\"]): null;`\n\n`averagePrice += el[\"Sales\"];`\n\n`});`\n\n`averagePrice = averagePrice / arrayOfPeople.length;`\n\n`}`\"\n\n\"Question: in your own words, the difference between HTTP GET and POST methods. What considerations would you take when deciding which method to use? What benefits and limitations are there to each?\"\n\nAnswer: \n\n\"`GET request is used to retrieve some resource.`\n\n`POST request is used to create a new resource.`\n\n`In terms of what I would use , I would never use POST for a GET or vice versa. Why? It can confuse fellow dev\u2019s and it\u2019s not standard practice.` \n\n`POST` \n\n`Pros: Transmits larger sets of data while GET is limited to 2048 characters and is useful for sensitive info.`\n\n`Cons: Never cached , never remain in history.`\n\n`GET`\n\n`Pros:  Can be bookmarked, Cached, remains in history.`\n\n`Cons: Not useful for sensitive information`\"\n\n\"Question: Imagine you have a plain text file containing an arbitrary number of lines, where each line is simply a single random word from the English language. There may be repeated words in this file. What combination of Linux shell commands could you use to find the repeated words in this file and how many times each of those repeated words appears in the file?\"\n\nAnswer: \n\n\"Tokenize the words , Sort the words, Then find consecutive or duplicate words and count them \n\n`grep -wo \u2018[[:alnum:]]\\+\u2019 INPUTFILEHERE| sort | uniq -c\"`\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry this is a bit long, this role was a JR Dev and would just like some input on my answers and what i can possibly do better. Maybe the call with the recruiter didn't go good? Maybe my answers are not efficient? Just want to improve. Please provide feedback if possible! Thanks",

        "body": "I'm working as an IT analyst in a billion dollar company in the logistics industry. Problem is career growth is pretty limited (there's only 3-4 levels in the hierarchy but benefits/salary is great) and promotion only happens maybe every 4-5 years. Currently I'm at their IT department where we're seen as the people who fix computers, spreadsheets, and troubleshoot, and is not the company's core competency.\n\nIn the long run, I'd like to be a technical product manager, but now I know that we (or any traditional logistics company) typically outsource software and only rarely build custom software (the part I enjoy the most). When I joined, I was hoping to build products or at least lead projects in logistics but those things can only be handed to you if you're in the operations department. Now an analyst job opened up in that department, and I'm thinking if I should apply or just apply in a faster growing software company in the same industry, where both tech and logistics are their core competencies.\n\n**Option A: Apply for Operations Analyst position within same company**\n\n**PROS**\n\n* I'll be able to lead or be part of the team involved in implementing projects I'm excited about (does not necessarily mean I\u2019ll be building products, but at least I\u2019ll gain greater domain expertise and greater impact)\n* Great pay and benefit\n* I'll gain greater domain expertise, and with that, can move to a software company focused in logistics industry\n\n**CONS**\n\n* My ideal goal of becoming a technical product manager may most likely not happen here, and I'll most likely be a senior analyst instead if I stay for the long run\n* Knowing what they do, potentially stressful\n\n**MAYBE PRO or CON**\n\n* Reporting directly to the head honcho or 2nd highest person of that department I plan to apply for\n* Maybe limited career growth in the long run because of the flat company hierarchy\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Option B: Stay with current role and wait for better options in a different company**\n\n**PROS**\n\n* Have the option to find better career trajectory and fit with a high growth logistics software company that can equally appreciate my tech and logistics background\n* I'll still be working towards being a project manager  (close enough to product manager, except managing roll outs of out-of-box solutions, and not creating them), and can potentially move to become technical product manager in the long run\n* I have a great manager and coworkers who are happy to help me grow professionally\n\n**CONS**\n\n* If I don't find that other \"better option outside\", my career (and pay) will be stunted regardless if I stay in my department since it's not my current company's core competency.\n* I'll continue working on things I don't find as fulfilling\n* The grass is not always greener on the other side\n* In the long run, I know I'll need to move on to a software company focused in logistics industry anyway if I want to be a technical product manager\n* Maybe I won't find that other unicorn company after all\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "title": "Tip for avoiding giving salary expectation number when talking to recruiter?",
        "body": "tl;dr: I'm an hourly worker being converted into full time, how do I negotiate salary? \n\n\\---\n\nI'm someone who is an hourly contractor. There's a recruitment company X which is paid money for each hour of work that I do at company Y. Then company X gives me a cut of that money. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's a salary position at company Y which opened up. Company Y reached out to me and asked me if I'd like to be converted over to a salary employee at company Y. I ended up in a zoom call with a recruiter, who asked me if I was interviewing with anyone else (I said no). She asked how many years of experience I had. She asked me for the name of Company X. I know it sounds a bit sketchy that a recruiter from Company Y doesn't know the name of Company X but... after what I've seen of company Y so far, I'm not surprised. And she asked me what my salary expectations were.\n\nI didn't give her the salary expectation number because I've read that you don't want to give the number incase you low ball yourself, and you really have no idea what the compensation range is. So I just asked her what the compensation band for the position was (I'm following the advice from here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9BoG1n1948](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9BoG1n1948)). She said it's confidential. \n\nI asked for the compensation structure so that I make a more informed decision. She listed the benefits of the company including paid time off, and the fact that there's a bonus based on performance. I asked for around what amount of money the bonus could be, and she said she didn't know. I ended up just asking if we could take this over email so I could think about it more, and asked if she could send information explaining the compensation structure and benefits. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe sent me an email and that email contained information about the health benefits. Nothing about the actual amount of PTO, or what the amounts of the bonuses would, or anything anything about the compensation structure. I replied back and asked to clarification on the compensation structure and amount of paid time off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really don't know how to approach this. Although I'm trying to adhere to a few things:\n\n1) In a respectful way, I'm NOT going to give her a salary expectation number. She can give me the offer.\n\n2) If my hourly rate is A, then I expect my salary to be 2\\*A in thousand minimum. If she gives me less, screw that, I'll just continue being a contractor as I'll literally be making more money that way. And then go find another job when my contract is close to being up.  \n\n3) I will NOT tell her what my hourly rate at company X is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo these 3 things sound like they're good ideas? And also, is there any tips you guys know of? I've browsed the wiki, and in 1 link, it was suggested to use glassdoor to get an idea of the salary at the company. At another link, it was said that information in sites like glassdoor is wildly out of date. And it does seem out of date... based on what my hourly rate is, I think the salaries on glassdoor need to be updated.",

        "body": "I live just outside of Miami, FL and I started a job  months ago with a firm out in the Northeast. I accepted this job with the expectation on both sides that this would be a long-term remote position. Much of the yoke of the staff is in the Boston area and used to travel to the office, but we've been expanding for remote roles since we are growing, me being one of them.\n\nHowever, since COVID is waning in the U.S, the executives have decided that the engineering, product, and data teams should be co-located, so they are looking for new office spaces in the city. They are also expecting me (nothing explicit yet but from my one-on-ones with my super I can smell it coming)  to be part of the move, even though we've had negotiations that I would remain in the South.\n\nI was hired as a Staff engineer for this company, and frankly I've been very, *very* productive over the past several months since I've been here (both in terms of product output as well as changes to infrastructure and strategy). I can remain productive here at home while I can still be close to my family, friends, and my roots.\n\nI \\*am\\* open to potentially relocating, but it depends not only my emotional state, but also what the company can do for me in terms of relocation and long-term stability within the company (tbf, the company is probably going to explode in growth). CoL between Miami and Boston is about 20-25% increase, so I am thinking of having that as a non-negotiable (along with moving cost paid for).\n\nI'm willing to walk away if need be, but I also don't want to interview again (lol) but more importantly also potentially be in a situation like this where I could be in this situation again.\n\nAgain, it's all implicit right now, but I'd rather be prepared now than have to face potential negotiation or a new job search without much warning time. Since I've never had this type of scenario occur (nor had to relocate for a job), I have some questions that I'm hoping some friendly internet strangers can help me with if you've had any experience.

        "body": "I won't bore you with the details of my career thus far, but long story short: \n\n* I'm 6 years out of college where I regrettably got a degree in a religious field and realized too late into college that it was the wrong move (for many reasons).  \n\n* After graduating I worked my way into a technical role (sort of a data analyst position) at a start-up where I worked for 4 years while I learned development on the side. \n\n* I then got an entry level back-end role at a mid-sized company where I've been (and excelled) for the last year and a half.\n\n\nThat brings us to now:\n\nMy partner and I are moving cities and my company is unfortunately (and aggravatingly) not permitting full-time remote work going forward, so I'm looking to find a job elsewhere.  I've had multiple interviews, but haven't been able to pass a single technical interview yet.  I'm feeling really, really discouraged.  What's frustrating though, beyond just getting rejected, is the complete and utter lack of any feedback.  It's just leaving me feeling a bit aimless on where to improve.\n\nThe specific interview I mentioned in the title of the post kind of blind-sided me.  For one thing, it was described as a \"HackerRank interview\" so I naturally assumed that it was going to be almost entirely leetcode-esque questions (and that's what I prepared for).  Instead, there was a single easy leetcode question and about 45 minutes of system design discussion.  I spent a good 2/3 of this question stumbling and looking like a deer in headlights.  For a little added context, this interview involved a lot of really involved discussion about database architecture and design, which is something I have effectively zero experience with. I work with databases often and I'm heavily involved in design discussions in the context of my team's work, but there are entire teams at my company who are responsible for systems and database architecture.  \n\n**Has this given me an unrealistic sense of what's expected of the average developer?**  I am well aware that interviewers don't necessarily expect you to have comprehensive knowledge of all of the topics they ask you about and they want to know how you approach a problem.  That said, there seemed to be a significant enough lack of knowledge on my end that I couldn't even really meet the interviewer in the middle.  \n\n\n*TL;DR - what do you expect of a back-end developer with 1.5 YOE? Would you expect proficiency in systems and database design?*",

        "body": "I want to preface this by saying I actually like coding. But I don't love it. I graduated a few months ago with a bachelors degree in chemistry and everything I know about coding, I taught myself either at night or sitting at CS classes whenever I could. Yesterday I found that post on the frontpage of this sub that basically says if you don't love coding, you shouldn't bother with it.\n\nAnd for some weird reason I really took it to heart. I mean, I actually like coding. I have a dozen or so OS contributions (small bug fixes or stuff like implementing a copy function for a window pane of a desktop application) and I thought it was a lot of fun getting code reviewed by experienced devs and working with other people (something I obviously couldn't do at university). It still feels like whenever I read something, be it here or elsewhere, people make it out to be this insurmountable task, like you have to live and breathe code or you're gonna get fired. Which is probably my biggest fear. The poster above mentioned stand-ups where you absolutely have to bring in results or you're (quoting) fucked. How do you even face the reality that you wasted years of your life on something only to realize you're not good enough?\n\nI keep trying to catch up whenever I feel down, at first, it was data structures. I went to the library and read through books over the course of a month while trying out Advent of Code to see if I really \"got it\". I managed to complete all puzzles from 2015-2020 without much outside help over the course of around a year, and for a few days, it felt like I managed to keep my impostor syndrome in check.\n\nUntil I realized I only know about backend programming and not much about full stack programming or client-server models. So I started up reading on HTML and CSS. I built a Spring Boot application for movie collection management using Hibernate, Thymeleaf and Spring Data JPA creating my own views. Another few months went by and I realized I don't know anything about cryptography. So I went back to the library to read up on it. It was of course only shallow knowledge but I still felt like I absolutely need to know it to make it as a developer.\n\nWhich brings me to my last point. Which is that I never feel ready, and whatever I do or learn I never will. Its just way too much knowledge and I feel so overwhelmed with it all, how can anyone know all this stuff and still have time to do other things? The post on the front page made me feel really bad, to the point where I just want to throw the towel in and continue chemistry instead even though I prefer coding.\n\nI have no idea why I am even making this post, does anyone else feel this way? Is anyone in a similar position? Did anyone overcome these feelings? I feel like a massive disappointment.",

        "body": "This is going to be long, and I would really appreciate any input/advice.\n\n**Background:** I go to a very small liberal arts college in the northeast US. Due to this, I'm not really exposed to the tech industry or highly competitive CS programs like at CMU and other target schools. My college also has virtually no name recognition outside of academic circles. I'm not lamenting this, I love my college, professors, and peers, it's just reality.\n\nTo help with this I've done 3 relevant internships (in order starting with most recent):\n\n1. Application Dev at a large local company (using .NET & MySQL)\n2. Backend Web Dev at a non-profit (PHP, MySQL, and Wordpress)\n3. Cyber Security at a fortune 25 (soft skills, didn't do a whole lot)\n\nI also have a few projects which are a CRUD application written in PHP & MySQL, another CRUD app written using JS & Bootstrap, and an Arduino project I did using C++.\n\nAcademically I was also appointed to be a teaching fellow by faculty (this also is work experience as it's a paid position) and finished the semester with a 4.2 GPA. My overall GPA is a 3.7 due to a low grade I received in Calculus which brings me to one of my main concerns. \n\nI chose to do a BA and haven't taken a math class above Calc I. This has given me a really great GPA and allowed me to pursue my non-stem interests in philosophy and Africana studies. However, I'm worried this could hurt me during the interview process as I've never taken linear algebra. I do very well in my CS classes to make up for this but I know math and CS normally go hand in hand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dilemma:** Before this year I didn't have my most recent internship secured, wasn't asked to be a teaching fellow, and had a 3.4 GPA. I was honestly really scared of what my job outlook would look like after graduation. I didn't think I would be able to find a decent job at all, let alone an internship this summer. Now, after everything that has happened, my outlook has changed a lot and I'm wondering what I should do. \n\nI don't go to a target school, I only have a BA, no FAANG internships, but I have what I have listed. Should I go grind leetcode and LinkedIn to get into larger companies? Is that even possible given my credentials? Is it worth it for me to accept a local job first to gain more experience or would that be selling myself short?\n\nI'm not really sure how my credentials look from an outsider perspective, I know this might come off as attention seeking but I genuinely have nobody to talk to about this. I'm stuck at home and none of my professors or classmates can really help since we're all in the same boat. \n\nMy main questions are essentially: \n\n1. Are big tech companies a possibility with my situation? \n2. Is it worth it to accept a job at a local non-tech company first or would that be selling myself short?\n3. If those companies are out of reach where might be a good sect to start gaining experience (defense contractor, non-tech, bio-tech/pharma, startup, etc.)?\n4. Should I grind leetcode or do another project using more modern frameworks/tools (react, electron, AWS, kubernetes, etc.)\n\nOverall I'm just wondering where I stand post grad, and I really appreciate any responses and sorry if this seems like a stupid/indirect question.",

I have a 3.4 gpa, a summer internship, and some related school jobs (tutoring, research assistant-ing), and two small personal projects on my resume, so an ok amount of qualifications, as far as I can see.\n\nI have a part time job over the summer so if I spend the other 20hrs/week sending applications, bothering recruiters on LinkedIn, and doing LeetCode/other interview practice, is it reasonable to expect to have a thing lined up by the end of the summer? I know nothing's certain in life and especially with the job market, but in terms of the most likely outcome, of course.\n\nNot seriously picky about where I apply / location for an entry level position, as long as job hopping (after a year or a year and a half, not three weeks) is viable.\n\nAsking for if I need to set up some living arrangement for when I can't live with my parents after the end of the summer. Wouldn't want to set up a lease somewhere and then be in a quandary bc I have a job offer somewhere else. But I also probably can't get a reliable place to live at the snap of a finger if it turns out that summer is over and I still don't have a job and place to move to.\n\nSo yeah, what's a reasonable timeline that I can plan around, assuming I start doing the job grind in two weeks after finals are over?\n\nThanks.",

Beware: longboi \n\nWent from a kid obsessed with minecraft and modding etc to having a rough time in my late teens. \n\nAfter hitting the bottom, I decided to seriously start looking at programming, so worked part time and coded in my spare time. I fell in love again, it suits how I think. It was like being a child, flowing for ages, gave me so much happiness and fulfilment to make something!\n\nTook it further and landed myself an apprenticeship with a boot camp style coding school who were partnered with a mystery company. The company are huge but are not an industry that lines with my values as a person!\n\nStayed on with said company who are using their own custom made adaptation of Tcl (tickle). Gained lots of knowledge on Linux, backend dev, creating schemas, stored procedures, relational diagrams schemas, docker, how the development lifecycle works, as well as much more + picking up good coding practices along the way, got a few certifications under my belt from Microsoft and BCS too. \n\nMost of their codebase is legacy code with next to no documentation on how things work. Lots of tech debt which isn\u2019t being cleaned up. Unsafe practices. I\u2019ve put some suggestions in and raised concerns for all. \n\nI raised my concerns for lack of learning too. manager told me not to worry. \u201cYou\u2019ll pick this all up in 10 years and be a senior, don\u2019t worry\u201d. Things are very old school here. A good friend, colleague and even better senior dev told me that if I want progression and a good cv, this company is not the place. Alarm bells were ringing and my passion was beginning to be snuffed out.\n\nThe little learning I get is very narrow and specific to the company. I\u2019ve asked for further training to understand the deeper whys, methods and technicalities of programming, if that makes sense? So I can be a better and more knowledgeable dev + be more adaptable to new languages, frameworks etc if the company was to adopt them. Put presentations to my managers, a case and why I\u2019m passionate to learn more and progress.\n\nHave been asking for a mentor for months. Been denied all of it. I get one day of textbook learning per quarter :/\n\nI\u2019m just so stressed and sad because my heart isn\u2019t in this job. I feel bad to leave. I\u2019ve poured my heart into doing long days because I loved what I was creating. Now, that passion has gone. I feel exhausted, depressed and burdened by my job. It\u2019s been almost two years here and I need to take another step forwards.\n\nI love my own projects and I teach myself for an hour, minimum, most days. My passion for tech is still there, undying. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of going to uni or getting a part time job in a cafe and volunteering my skills for an amazing project that lines up with the way that the world is going + my core values, see where it takes me and as always do my damn best!\n\nWhat do you all think? It\u2019s been brewing for a while but I can\u2019t take anymore! The straw has broken the camel\u2019s back and he\u2019s now off work with stress!",

The problem is, entrepreneurship is what sounds interesting to me. There are two side projects I\u2019m passionate about that I\u2019ve been working on for a little over a year and they\u2019re just at the point where I can push sales.\n\nOn one hand, I know the smart thing to do would be to work to make a venture profitable before making the switch. But I also wonder if the burnout (and misery) I feel from my day job is holding me back. My day job isn\u2019t too demanding, maybe 30 hours a week, but it causes me a lot of anxiety so I think about it for more time than that. \nI have around a 200k nest egg saved up (all invested) and live with my parent.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like they just want to quit their jobs?

        "body": "Hello all,\n\nI am in my early twenties and have three credits left towards a bachelors degree in urban planning. As an undergraduate, I focused on more legal and social studies based classes because I wanted to focus on a career in community development, and housing in particular.\n\nHowever, after multiple internships working in the field, I have come to the conclusion that this work is not for me. I work better with \u201cthings\u201d rather than \u201cpeople\u201d, and simply do not have the emotional stamina to support others in difficult situations day in and day out.  I am looking for a way to change careers to something that suits me better and is more sustainable.\n\nI have always been interested in science and technology but mistakenly thought I was too dumb to pursue it, as I did not get good grades in high school. (I have a average/good university GPA, however)  It is not financially viable for me to go to graduate school at the moment but I was wondering if there was still a way for me to make a career change soon.\n\nI have some beginner-level python programming experience, as well as experience in R and ArcGIS from undergrad. I would say that I am able to complete small projects with these tools if I have clear instructions, but would not consider myself proficient enough to the point that I am employable. \n\nI am very interested in working in GIS because I find it interesting and liked using it in undergrad. It also seems to be a very stable career choice, which attracts me to it. \n\nI see a lot of GIS jobs also like to see experience in Python and SQL, so I am also interested in developing these skills.\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew of resources to help me develop a higher level of proficiency in ArcGIS and Python, as well as to begin to learn SQL? In particular, I am interested in resources that would help me create projects to put in a portfolio or have some sort of certification at the end, as I feel like that would help keep me motivated to complete it and it might be helpful to be able to put something on a resume.\n\nI am not opposed to paying for a course or program as long as it is helpful, high quality and relatively inexpensive. I think I may still have access to ArcGIS from my university as I am technically still a student. I have been thinking of receiving a two semester GIS certificate at a local community college as I knock out my last remaining credit requirement but would like to explore cheaper, more DIY options first, especially since I will be working full time. I am a bit frustrated looking for courses online because they seem to assume you are a complete beginner to coding and many don\u2019t let you skip ahead. \n\n\nWould building a portfolio and brushing up on skills with online classes be able to help me get my foot in the door or am I better off getting the certificate at college or waiting until I can go to graduate school? \n\nThank you in advance for any advice or suggestions!",

        "title": "Where to find recruiters who will help get me placed in a permanently remote position? (The continuing saga of a depressed Smalltalk dev)",
        "body": "I'm the guy who posted [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kpr2iu/spent_2_years_unemployed_after_graduation_finally/) [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lp2xff/started_a_new_job_2_months_ago_hate_it_and_dont/) threads. TL;DR: I was unemployed for 2 years after graduating in 2019, got some offers rescinded in 2020 due to COVID, finally got a job this January. It was supposedly a \"Smalltalk\" position that turned out to involve a proprietary framework, which is basically a double whammy in terms of increasing my market value for other dev positions since these skills are basically non-transferrable. \n\nLong story short, I absolutely hate this job. Trash pay ($60k) in a high COL area (Miami). I'm extremely demotivated at work because I'm acutely aware that I'm working with obsolete, proprietary tech that there's absolutely no demand for in the job market, which is already bad due to COVID.\n\nThe only slight silver lining about this job was that it was fully remote due to COVID, but in late April we got a company-wide CC informing us that the executives or whoever's in charge of making these decisions wants the entire team bAcK tO tHe OfFiCe a minimum of 3 days a week starting in June. This means that on top of hating my job, I'm now taking a cut to my already trash-tier pay (since I'll have to commute an hour a day, which will significantly increase my gas bill) and I'll have to spend an hour of my day commuting to some cramped shithole open office just so that middle managers can micromanage me or so coworkers can tap me on the shoulder every 10 minutes to chitchat, or forcibly having to listen in on other people's chitchat because everyone is sitting 2 feet away from each other. In sum, I hate working in the office and I don't want to go back.\n\nSo I've been fervently applying to other jobs ever since I posted my 2nd thread. I've had a few interviews since then, and I just recently made it to the final stage of a fully remote JavaScript/React position that was basically a perfect fit for me - much better pay, obviously much better actually in-demand tech stack, and most importantly, it was fully and permanently remote. The team was extremely impressed with me and I crushed my final interview last Monday, made it to the offer stage. I eased up on applying, because the senior devs I had my final interview with made it pretty clear during my final interview that this was a done deal and they were going to extend an offer. A week of radio silence goes by, then on Friday I get an email from the CEO notifying me that the person who was going to leave the company had decided to stay. They made it clear that I had done very well on the interviews, and they really tried to see if they could expand the team to make bring me aboard, but they weren't sure if they were ready to expand their team given the iffy COVID economy, but they would like to \"stay in touch\" and reach out if something changes in the future (obviously this won't happen, it was basically a \"sorry, better luck next time\" rejection).\n\nGetting this email crushed me. I spent the entire weekend depressed. This was a long and arduous interview process and it involved a take-home project that took me a full day and a half to do. I'm now 2 weeks out from going back to the office with zero prospects lined up. I'm back to frantically shotgunning applications for remote positions on every job site I know of, but haven't heard a thing yet (other than automated rejections) and I almost certainly won't hear anything before it's time to go back to the office at my current job. The worst part of all this is that I will now have MUCH less leeway to apply to jobs and interview. It's impossible for me to interview while I'm at the office because it's an open office environment with no privacy, and it's not like I can just have 10 tabs of job sites open when my computer screen is fully visible to the entire team if they just look over my shoulder (including managers).\n\nI've seen people on this board talk about \"working with recruiters\" who you send your resume to and then they basically find a position that fits your needs/qualifications for you. My question is, how or where do you find these people? The only \"recruiting firms\" I've seen are basically websites that have a \"job seekers\" tab that is basically just a shittier version of LinkedIn/Indeed where they index a bunch of open positions that you can apply to. Where are these recruiters who will take my resume and work with me 1-on-1 to help me find a permanently remote position? I can't find them. I'd appreciate some help on this. I'm literally losing sleep and my appetite, can't enjoy my afternoons anymore because every day I look at the calendar I'm a day close to going back to the fucking office. I've actually considered just quitting this job with nothing else lined up if nothing turns up by June, because I just can't stomach the thought of going back to the office anymore.",

        "body": "I'm a seasoned front end guy with a lot of wordpress years under my belt, during Covid I went to a bootcamp because why not? I learned new stuff about react and node. I'm one month into the interview process and I've done some good ones and never have I ever been through the dehumanizing experience I just went through.\n\nThis was a round 3 interview after I met with the VP and CTO of a 50-201 employee company. They liked my experience and loved that I spent Covid getting new skills up...they were both very well aware that I am a WordPress guy moving into full stack and react. The \"developer lead\" who interviewed me had absolutely no idea what he was doing. He started with reviewing recent projects of mine...when I told him the most recent one had a ruby on rails API as the backend he seemed to not want to talk about it because it was out of his tech stack. \n\nSo we moved onto an express/node project of mine and he started asking me questions that had nothing to do with the project. Everytime I told him we can look at the code and I can walk you through whatever questions u have on it he started getting angrier (he had a thick accent - I'm 1st gen american so I come from similar accented people). He never once looked at the code for my project or the deployed site. Just consistently berated me with ultra specific questions that he wanted me to code on the Zoom Chat Window. I slapped together a few json objects that I thought he was asking for but he never even looked at them. His English was a little broken and he was very angry so it was hard to understand. Before he even looked at my json object he moved over to AWS lightsail which I've used once in my life - I've used godaddy's hosting for 7 years. I told him what I knew about it and with no response he went to asking about Redux in React which I'm also pretty new to.\n\nLong story short...this guy had a screw loose and my brain is still trying to comprehend WTF just happened. After speaking with the VP and CTO I had completely different expectations for this interview. I was specifically told by the VP to not worry about brushing up on anything and to just be myself. The complete 180 in attitude and demeanor of this interviewer has me questioning what I'm doing on this planet now.\n\nThe position was for a entry/junior full stack developer.\n\nI am pretty confident I won't get the job, I will hear from them this week.\n\n\nUpdate- did not get the job lol",

        "body": "Dev with 5+ years of experience here\n\nSo I started working in this current company (startup with lots of customers, single product) two years and a half ago as a backend software architect. Well it went pretty good, but after 6 months our CTO had to step down for health reasons so I was forced to took over that role. I must confess I was pretty scared to manage a development team and being responsible for much more things in the corporate environment, but I took that as an opportunity to grow and develop other skills. And also, after a couple of months I would be more experienced and comfortable in that role, right?\n\nWell, I don't feel like it. Two years have passed by since that promotion and even when my teammates, devs, and superiors feel I'm better at that position than our previous CTO, this is starting to affect my personal life. I am now responsible for developing, testing, QA, customers installations, leading a team, and requirement analysis and I don't have time to do everything now unless I put +60hs a week (which I don't think is healthy). Plus, my boss is really into micromanagement and scope creeping which is making our work harder.\n\nIn the last year, after continuous up and downs and fuckups that culminated last Wednesday when an important customer cancelled an installation after seeing our product was unfinished, my boss suddenly decided to throw me under the bus. To an extent I was to blame (after all I'm the CTO) but I saw this fuckup coming 4 months back, when every week I requested my boss to give us a testing environment and a demo environment separate from our dev environment (which, according to his orders, we couldn't test there). He always said \"sure, i'll create it right soon\" but then nothing happened. This last time I felt betrayed though.\n\nAfter having in account that most of the problems we've faced and are currently facing could've been avoided if he listened to me and my team, I'm now starting to think if I should leave. Many times before I've suggested my boss how to improve our workflow and version control and he always promised to be part of it and listen to me, but nothing ever changed. This last time was not and exception\n\nSo I'm now temped to leave this company and start over in another one as a dev, which is what actually I want to do most, but I'm not still sure if I should give another shot here at improving things, or neither do not know how to communicate to my boss I'm no longer happy here.

It's very hard to convince them to say something to my face, even when I frame it as \"please tell me what the problem is so maybe I can help or do a better job\", but some recent events got me suspicious, and I have figured out that it's way worse than I thought. They've probably been saying horrible things about me for years. I think they're firing me soon but idk when, and I don't care tbh. I also don't really care anymore about what their problem with me is exactly.\n\nI don't want to make this too long by saying everything that happened bc it's been four years of working there, but I'll go into those recent events that I mentioned. Through Slack's screen share, I saw a coworker's slack conversation that he left open, about me. They said things like \"no one likes working with him\" and \"it seems there's no one else available to, we're fucked\" (because I was put on a project with them). This got me suspicious and I started thinking about other stuff that happened, and realized that, while I already knew how they are, it's probably way worse than I thought.\n\nI also asked my boss, regarding people who has been complaining to him about me (not about this incident per se), to please tell me what the problem is so maybe I can help, but he didn't respond for several days.\n\nAs to why this is happening, I'm not sure because they don't say much to me. Maybe they started shit talking me for some reason and it snowballed from there, which I've seen happen to others, or maybe it's something I did.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I know that nothing justifies this sort of behavior on their part, but maybe there's still something that I'm doing that bothers them and is the reason for this. When I first started working here I did extra good at first, to give a good first impression, and later kinda toned it down, so to speak. I'm still getting the job done, I don't actually miss deadlines, but idk, maybe they expect a different level of involvement with the job. And that's ok, if they were respectful about it.\n\nFrom what I could gather, they have accussed me of missing deadlines due to deadlines they didn't tell me about, or bugs being detected after delivering something. They also told me that I should respond to Slack faster now that we're working from home. Those are the only two concrete complaints I could get from them. Besides that, I get a feeling that they do expect a different level of involvement with the job from me, so to speak, as in, they're the kind of people who tries to be the best, tries to get promotions etc, and expect the same from me, and it bothers them that I'm more chill about it.\n\nI will try to do those things even though I'm sure I'll get fired anyway. Just so they can't legitimately claim I didn't do a good job when that happens. I'll try to prevent bugs in my code, and to respond more quickly to Slack despite having Intellij on full screen (im not the only one at all who takes a while when I'm busy, but its still something I can work on since it bothers them).\n\nAnyway the thing is, I'm done with these guys. Like I said, it's ok if they expect me to be more involved with the job, or if there's stuff they want me to change about the way I work, but constantly saying shit about me behind my back, refusing to say it to my face when confronted, and ignoring me, isn't. \n\nI hate them at this point. I hate my boss and most of my coworkers. I think they're pathetic, their personal lives are empty and a failure, the only reason they talk about promotions and raises all the time is that the only way they can have someone in their lives is if they have money and financial stability to offer, and that this whole thing probably boils down to the fact that I'm not like them. And I don't care about what people like that thinks about me tbh.",

        "body": "I graduated university by leeching off my friends in coding projects and just memorized enough to get my diploma; I had ZERO coding experience/aptitude.\n\nMy programming journey started by doing LeetCode questions and I just felt incredibly stupid. I eventually was able to understand the logic behind 1 question but I didnt feel like I really progressed. \n\nThen I went to Udemy to do some online courses aaaaaaand yup. Tutorial Honeymoon phase. I felt like I was progressing and doing actual programming. Once I wanted to try to do what I\u2019ve learned on my own, I realized, I had no idea how to start.\n\nOnce I decided to make my own projects, (and I emphasize that this is the crucial turning point to start the upswing) things started to click and connect. \n\nI started by literally spending a whole day just memorizing how to create a project:\nnpx create-react-app [project name], cd [project name], npm start. Then slowly but surely, I Googled and YouTubed what I wanted to do. It was a simple React Counting app, then I wanted to learn Hooks, then I wanted to learn CSS... it just kept snowballing. Before I knew it, I had my own portfolio website, a couple of projects I\u2019ve completed on my own and I felt ready to apply. \n\nApplying is a numbers game. I applied to 10 jobs a day for 3 months straight. I\u2019ve gotten maybe 15 calls in those 3 months. Of the 15 calls, 6 of them gave me a chance with a technical test, and of those 6 chances, I\u2019ve failed 5 of them. The one I didnt fail? I made it to the final round of interviewing only to lose because someone else just had more experience than me. \n\nI was tired and drained but not too long after that final round silver medal, I got an email offer.\n\nI\u2019ve never been so happy to get an offer in my life. All the struggle was worth it. I would also like to say that I identify as a \u201cgifted burnout\u201d and I did therapy to help me overcome my \u201cchild prodigy\u201d ego or whatever you wanna call it. \n\nIf you feel like you\u2019re past your prime or you cant learn to program, learn from a gifted-burnout-slacker like me. You CAN. Believe in yourself. Keep going. Its a marathon, and I\u2019ll see you on the other side of the finish line.",

I'm just responsible for storing (historical) data in table format and displaying it in reports/dashboards. There's also a pretty considerable business component involved.   \nNow I was just wondering: is this field \"future-proof\" and will there be a market for these skills in say 5-10 years? Or should I move more towards Data Science (meaning applying algorithms to the data, Python instead of database tools, less structured data in table form, statistics, etc.)?   \n\n\nThanks!",

I'd like to give a bit of history to add context to my question:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Year 1** \\- Worked at a medium-sized, non-tech company, 60k (low ball but somewhat reasonable for my skill level)\n* **Year 2** \\- Same company, 70k, a little less reasonable but a generous raise relatively speaking\n* **Year 3** \\- SaaS startup (one of two engineers), big starry-eyed bonus dreams, 70k offer (very low for skill level, but prefaced as a 'startup sacrifice' which I suppose I agree on. I do feel as though I should earn my way to a degree). Worked hard but voiced concerns about salary many times through the year. CEO very personable, kind guy (we've hung out off hours) but seems a little...exploitative\n   * SaaS flopped, switched to consulting business midway through at a modest profit. \n* **Year 4 (Current)** \\- 10% raise to 77k (extremely low at skill level), 3% equity (for a consultancy, doesn't mean too much to me), 2% bonus of all revenue beyond 300k. **Still haven't gotten this in writing** (something to do with lawyers, etc.)\n   * Brought 2 new employees into the company, ramped them up and managed them while working on my own contracts\n   * Needed healthcare this year, CEO zoom called me and said I would need to pay 300$/month. I snapped back when I mentioned my coworker was paying only 90$/month, he backed off and it was resolved.\n   * Lost belief in the companies success partially due to project management on the CEO side, partially due to the nature of the business which was 'anything for the money' type contract jobs. \n   * Got an offer without even trying at 130k+, accepted it to start in 4 weeks. Told boss, gave 3 weeks (I want to take a week off), he called to tell me he was disappointed I wouldn't do all I could to prepare them for my absence (he was trying to get 5 weeks out of me). Negotiated I work a day or two in the 4th week as well.\n\nI feel as though I can step back a bit and look at the whole situation for the first time now that I'm out the door. My CEO is obviously not thrilled I'm leaving, made me feel bad for only giving 3 weeks - but I can't help but feel a little irritated after what I've contributed to the startup.",

In June 2020, I was looking for a part time job and came across a data entry job, It was very small job and after a few days, I made automation script which would do my 80% of work without any input. This went on for a month or so then I started applying for more automation jobs on Upwork and other freelancing websites and got into QA without knowing what it really is. I was approached by a guy who worked in a company and he outsourced his work to me. Now as I worked there for 4 months, I decided to apply to more QA Jobs myself, and started reading about QA. Now I have 2 interviews upcoming this week and all I read here and elsewhere is that once you get into QA it is impossible to get out of it and you also get looked down upon and it doesn't look good on your resume if you apply to SDE Jobs. I am too newbie to understand the chemistry but does this mean I should not take these Jobs even if I pass the interview?\n\nI don't actually love the QA work but I don't hate it, I love automating the stuff but it's not that actually. I am too confused. My coding skills are okay, not very sharp and I have few projects in my plate but nothing too crazy too show off. Should I now continue this path and work on myself alongside and make the switch when my degree end next year in June or should I just drop this idea and keep working on my projects and get the deveopment jobs. I don't have any internships yet but I am looking for one. Also I have two projects at the moment both QA, both from persons who won't work but outsource, and pay me less.   \nI am new to this sub, please show some mercy :)",

I've been slowly (I think) learning how to code for the past 2~3 years and I'm pretty confident that I will study CS. I know that apart from what I do in college I will have to do my own stuff.(project-wise)\n\nThe thing is, the way I see it, the rate at which I learn will increase substantially when it is no longer extracurricular or a hobby and it becomes what I'm studying all day. Is this true? If so, should I wait for college to worry about making my own stuff or pressure myself this summer to learn new stuff and make projects and progress in as much as I can? Because if I will learn at a much more quicker and guided pace in college I guess I don't need to stress about it, since I will be able to use what I learn to make bigger, more complex stuff, right? Of course beginning from the basics.\nBut if any part of my reasoning is wrong, and it is a good idea to push myself this summer and upcoming year, I would like to know.\nAlso, I am not saying that if the answer is I can relax that I will stop making stuff until college, at the moment I do this for fun and to learn, and I won't stop, the difference would be the pressure I put myself to learn more deep/complex stuff.\n\nAny information or experience anyone can share is greatly appreciated.",

        "body": "I recently went for  technical interviews at two different companies for a junior full stack  dev role (I have less than 1 year of working experience). Lets call them  company A and B.\n\nCompany A is a medium sized \"start up\" which has been running for  about 10 years now, and has great ratings on glassdoor (4.1). For my  first technical interview, I was given an easy to medium difficulty  algorithm questions. The interviewer was a senior engineer in the  company who seemed really helpful and had a normal level of peoples  skills. In my second technical interview in this company, I was tasked  to design (but the code didnt have to compile) a system that worked like  a forum with posts and upvotes in a pair programming format with  another engineer. They wanted to see how I would approach the problem  and were willing to give me hints when I was stuck. In the final round  of interview, I spoke with the VP of engineering over video call and the  dude seemed super passionate. I'm currently awaiting for my interview  result from this company.\n\nCompany B seems like a unicorn startup which is currenty pre-IPO and  also has really good ratings on glassdoor (4.1). For my interview in  company B, i was first given an online MCQ test. I scored miserably with  a score of 18/100, but they decided to give me a chance to progress  with the next round of technical interviews. During the next round of  technical interviews, the interviewer who I had not met before,  immediately jumped into asking the technical questions without first  introducing himself or what the team does. He gave me two medium level  algorithm questions where I had to code on google docs. He was extremely  quiet and when I got stuck for 15 minutes and asked for hints, he told  me to think a little bit more (what kind of hint is that...).  Surprisingly, I managed to complete the algorithm questions and am  scheduled for the next round of interview with this company, where they  will be testing me on medium to hard level algorithm questions. I am  expecting to flunk the interview by the way.\n\nMy gut feeling tells me that company B will not be a great working  experience if my colleagues are going to be like my interviewer, however  I'm not sure if this is just because I'm scared of the upcoming  technical interview with them. Does anything I mentioned above seem like  red flags for either company?",

She made this beautiful website: [https://kesineep.github.io](https://kesineep.github.io) which frankly blows anything I've ever put on my public \"github show and tell\" out of the water (spoiler I have nothing).\n\nI think she's completed all the front-end FreeCodeCamp courses and earned the front end certificate there and works with a coding club on other projects and constantly in latenight zoom meetings practicing Leetcode and discussing other topics but is still stuck landing that first job.\n\nI really think her skills are finally at the point to land that first gig but she's having trouble breaking the barrier and it's especially more difficult as she doesn't have a CS degree. She did go to college in Thailand and has an International Relations degree however I don't think that counts towards anything imo.\n\nWondering if you guys have any tips on landing a first job with no CS degree. From my understanding it's aready difficult enough for new entrants. She's currently considering some unpaid internships as a possibility to get some experience on the resume however that would obviously eat into time she could be applying for a paid job.\n\n**TLDR: What are some tips for breaking the first job barrier with no CS degree and would an unpaid internship help here?**",

        "body": "I graduated about 5 months ago and I haven\u2019t found a job. My student loans are about to start asking me to pay in about a month (about $10k in debt). I graduated with a CS degree and a minor in math, with a 3.34 gpa. I never had an internship, except for a program I did my senior year of high school with Texas Instruments, which was basically an internship but mostly focused on electrical engineering (I was part of an engineering academy program at my high school before majoring in CS.)\n\nMy current strengths are Java, since that\u2019s what most of my college courses used, and I have decent experience solving easy and medium LeetCode problems (in Java) (solved 100+ easy and 100+ medium so far).\n\nMy GitHub doesn\u2019t have anything extraordinary, but I have a lot of the LeetCode problems I\u2019ve solved on there, many with an explanation of how I approached the problem. I have some repositories I made while learning a programming language or while taking a Udemy course that just has basic code, and I have 1 personal project I made with Java. I\u2019m also planning to add some stuff I made in the past (2 games while in high school, 1 thing I made on my own, and another one I did in college in a group). www.github.com/21david is my GitHub.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve been considering a bootcamp called App Academy. Should I do App Academy? It is 4 months long and teaches Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and other tools for full stack web development.\n\nBefore considering this, I was learning android app development (using Kotlin) on Udemy and was just planning to do that, make a few apps, also learn iOS development and cross-platform development, and then try to find a job as a mobile developer.\nShould I keep learning app development until I\u2019ve made a few apps? Should I just apply now for whatever jobs I can for Java or Kotlin jobs? I think pretty much all job applications that I see have requirements that I do not meet. First of all, many require 1 or more years of experience required, which I don\u2019t have, and second, many require things I have no experience in. Things I never tried out, some quick examples might be Java Spring, database stuff, other tools, etc. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t really know what to do. Maybe this is a good reason to do a bootcamp, because they will guide me and teach many things college didn\u2019t. I feel like doing a bootcamp makes up for not having had a relevant internship.\n\nBut I feel like I\u2019m taking a risk. What if I don\u2019t like the technologies I learn, or what if I don\u2019t like full stack web development? Although I did enjoy the web development courses I took earlier (like last month or before). And I did want to learn JavaScript. Ruby is meh though, I don\u2019t think I enjoy learning and using it as much as Kotlin and Java.\n\nOn the other hand I was enjoying learning app development with Kotlin and I feel like this kind of interrupted that.\n\nSorry if this was a long post.\n\nTl;dr\nGraduated college 5 months ago, 3.34 gpa, no internships during college, some stuff on my GitHub, nothing extraordinary. Considering a boot camp, or teaching myself app development until I find a job. Not sure where to go from here though.",

        "body": "Long story short, I graduated 2 years ago with a BA in accounting and I started doing an MS in computer science. I spent most of my time self-study to catch up with my classmates since they had a pretty \"heavy\" history with computer science (doing BS in CS, some internships, etc.) versus me who has just written my \"Hello World\" program when I got in the program.\n\nThat also means that I did not have much time to implement any personal project that is closely related to my interest (data science), and the projects that I have done are class-related (security, scraping data, etc.). My full-time work experience is in researching with different department professors (finance, accounting, economics, etc.).\n\nI am confident in my knowledge of stats (this is what I have worked with while doing research), machine learning, and probably algorithms. I will even graduate with a 4.0 GPA - but still, I feel like, without any internship or projects, I am most likely bringing a rusty knife to a gunfight.\n\nWhat advice would you folks have for me?",

        "body": "A bit of background info: I have been in my current organization for 10 years now and have held mid to senior positions. It has been good 10 years and I got to learn a lot, however lately I\u2019ve started to feel like I need a change due to many reasons most important of which is needing a new perspective and challenges.\n\nIn these 10 years I have not interviewed with anyone, so as you all can imagine, I am out of touch with how to approach the overall interview process. I got one offer a few weeks ago, which I declined since I was not fully ready to switch right away. I have a few more interviews lined up and things are going well so far. My questions are these and if you can offer some advice on it will be appreciated:\n\n1) How much time can you reasonably ask for before you reply to an offer? Since I am going to be interviewing at a few places, I would like to wait for some progress before accepting or declining one. Is the expectation to answer in a day or two?\n\n2) What reason do you give to a recruiter for asking more time? Can I just be honest and tell them I would like to wait to see how my other interviews go?\n\n3) Once I accept an offer, will it be too bad to decline it after? Does this happen often?\n\n4) I would like to take a vacation before I resign in my current organization. I have too many days accumulated. Is it reasonable to ask for joining in 4-5 weeks (3 weeks off plus 2 weeks notice)\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post. I apologize for poor formatting, I am posting from my phone.",

        "body": "I realize this thread, and most of reddit, is US centric but I'm hoping there are some kind, wise sages browsing this sub reddit from Europe or that at least the advice of the kind, wise US sages also applies to Europe.\u00a0\n\nGiven this crazy 2 years I am grateful to even have a job but I find myself seeming to be a bit stuck in my career and I am hoping to get some advice about how I should move forward from people with more experience. I have a bachelor's degree in Software Development (4 years full time) and about 4.5 years of experiences between 3 companies (1 was 5 months internship).\n\nDuring the last 2.5 years of my career, my salary has actually stayed flat and then decreased slightly and is now hovering just ever so slightly above the median average of the country I am in (Netherlands).\n\nI dont see a future with me sticking with the same company who only increase the salary by 2.4% every 15 months. To be honest, the only reason I want a higher salary is to be able to afford a home. If I already had one, I would be more interested in quality-of-life aspects but alas.\n\nThe current average salary that I am on enables me to either rent in a single room apartment/studio with little savings building up (if im even lucky enough to find such a place to rent) or to live in a house share, saving for at least 50% of a house as the max mortgage i could get wouldn't even cover 50% of the average house price. At this rate it would take me 22 years of living in a house share until I have enough to buy a house at the prices of writing this in 2021.\n\nAnd so, I find myself wondering how it is possible to better position oneself and increase one's salary as a software engineer/develop in the Netherlands?\n\nI had 2 ideas so far Im hoping to get some feedback on.\n\n**Idea 1: Get a master's degree in something that will pay well (Data science, Security, computer science, AI/ML).**\n\nNow I realize this idea isn't as simple as, do master's degree -> salary goes up 30%. As I understand it, doing a master's degree in anything other than computer science/software development will be going down a specialization path which means that the general software jobs are no longer really open to me.\n\nIts possible my salary would go up a good bit but the number of jobs I can apply for will be fewer. In addition, there is a risk involved as to do a full time 2-year course I would need to apply and win a grant, quit my job, spend another 2 years in education and afterwards deal with having to apply to compatible positions after graduation until I get lucky enough to find something, not to mention that the landscape could drastically change in 2 years (feeling the effects of covid recession for example).\n\nDoing something general like computer science/software development might increase the job opportunities even more than doing a specialization, as in opening up higher paid developer jobs that have higher standards/requirements but im not sure how big the pay raise would be, its possible that its not even worth it.\n\nIm not sure about this idea, it may be possible to do a part time masters and still keep my current job as a safety net but it\u00a0doesnt look very realistic.\n\n**Idea 2: Become a Fintech developer.**\n\nDoing a bit of looking around, I noticed how much higher the salaries are for fintech developers, about more than double of what im on. It could be feasible to research what it takes and what it requires to get a role in one of these highly paid positions. I would imagen its incredibly difficult and maybe I do not have enough IQ for it.\n\nI would also imagen its very competitive and there would be many seniors who would want these positions but maybe if I take the time to study/education and make contacts and do some side projects/learning it could be possible to eventually break into this field. Anyone with experience of getting into fintech?\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSo right now, these are the only ideas that I have and im not 100% sure how realistic/feasible they are. Maybe someone has more ideas about what I could do?\n\nIf im just going to be stuck on the national average all my life then I don't really see the point of continuing. Id rather become an English teaching Buddhist monk in Thailand than be a 50-year-old house sharer who rented all his life, put off having a family and now is responsible for taking care of his aging parents.\n\nThank you for reading this and potentially giving some advice. I could really use some guidance from people with more experience.",

        "title": "Reality Check: Please ensure Software Engineering is what you REALLY want to do",
        "body": "A lot of people here will meme about SWE being just \"oh it's copy and pasting code\" off stackoverflow, github, or \"I literally don't do anything most of my day, it's boring\"  but the true reality is doing this shit will get you stressed to the ends of your of wits if you don't actually have an understanding of what you're doing to an extent. This is perhaps the #1 job where people realize the job is NOT worth the pay anymore due to how hard it is (for those that are chasing solely for the money but figure on later out that they can't actually do the job). SWEs are paid good money for a reason. If you can do the job well but hate your job, then that's a different problem that doesn't regard to my point. People who underperform *consistently* in the private industry do get disciplined, and that's not just due to a 'toxic' environment. It's a competitive industry overall.\n\nYou really need to know and understand what the errors are that you're running into and how to fix this. And yes, you do need to know how to code, more than just those 100 line programs you make during college. I'm saying this because I've known many people who go through their degree cheating on assignments and exams (especially with online learning), and then during their new grad position when they run into errors they don't know how to fix it they're stumped for hours. When Monday Agile meetings/standups happen and you have nothing to screenshare, yea you're actually fucked.\n\nI'm not trying to scare people from pursuing SWE, but just know that it's a lot different from college, and with the amount of people who dilly their way through it I guarantee you will get smoked in industry. Also, this profession is not for everyone and know that is okay. If 100% of people who pursued a CS/SE degree freshman year of college and continued to want to become a SWE, oh boy the job market would be fucked even more lol.\n\nEdit: I say this because 2 people on my team pretty much got fired because they couldn't withstand the workload and meet the sprint expectations. It was pretty obvious with the amount of help they asked and no deliverable code present, and note, this wasn't just a one time thing. They were hired for roughly 8 months or so and they were NOT new grads; I know junior engineers aren't expected to know everything and that's understandable, but these people were NOT junior and didn't even know how to do things that were basic in the job requirements. I don't know how tf they got through HR. I understand HR doesn't disclose why a person gets fired, but trust me, you didn't have to ask. It was very, very obvious.\n\nMy main message is to just understand what you're getting into in this industry before you make a career mistake. If you're consistently putting in a lot of effort and cannot meet the deliverables of the company, then maybe this profession isn't for you (it's a hard truth, but it's reality). However, if you are able to bypass the imposter syndrome, great continue on. This post is for those who think they can fluff their resume and interviews with stuff they didn't actually do then get screwed when they get hired. When deadlines hit and they can't report any working deliverable to their boss because they're stuck not knowing how to do something, that's really gets some of these people anxious. Kind of the \"Shit I didn't think I'd get this far\" type of thing. Coding didn't really fit me, and it was honestly too stressful for me to pursue so I went more towards a SRE role.\n\nA lot of people think I'm trying to come off as gate keeping them away from SWE, but I'm doing the complete opposite: trying to re-evaluate if you think you can really do this career and warn you of what's ahead. I came from imposter syndrome too, but when I figured that I was spending 5x longer to fix a bug or error that my co-worker could fix in just an hour, that's really what got me anxious and stressed out. I couldn't keep up to speed with the projects and team so I personally left to a different team. It just wasn't for me and I at that point I realized yea, it's time to move on.\n\nI'm trying to prevent those who are consistently failing now and running in the same circles to just throw in the towel and stop the sunk cost fallacy before you damage yourself further. This is different from being stuck a bug and trying to google what's wrong. *It's wrong to motivate and support someone in doing something that isn't for them, especially when they know that* (that's how I see it). *You'll lead them to failure in the end*. However, if you're progressing, learning, and able to complete your work's responsibilities, then this post doesn't apply to you <3.\n\nLastly, don't bullshit your resume with skills you don't actually know. We find out one way or another.",

        "body": "Hello, I am 27 years old, graduated last year with MBA degree. After that I worked in IT company on one project as part of Helpdesk team. I got super invested in this field and really grew a lot of love for it. Then coronavirus hit and I was laid off (as I lost my student rights after graduating). For months I looked for job and recently got job as brand manager, but I can already see that I don't see myself in that type of job, and I would rather be business data analyst or something in those lines than what I do now.\n\nI was just about to start using our databases (on that project) but sadly I was introduced to mere basics and haven\u2019t learned much more as I was laid off. I always had techie side to me, which is why I was called to do this job in first place, and data science is something that really sparks my interest and I genuinely want to learn and do something in that field (if possible).\n\nMy question is, is it possible for someone who like me never studied formally Computer Science learn some of those skill and programming and programming languages, and turn them into career or is it too late? I was thinking to start with learning basics on my own (I got advice to start with Python or SQL), and then maybe when I need to advance those basics to take a course or something. Is this good start?\n\nAt work we use program (ERP) that is based on SQL and I guess all of our data is saved on Microsoft SQL server (I still haven\u2019t been able to get this information as most of my coworkers are only basic computer users \u2013 they don\u2019t even know how to open console on chrome), so I assume that if I actually knew SQL and how to work in databases I could implement that in my work.\n\nBasically I\u2019m looking for any advice I can get. Thanks in advance!  \n\n\nEDIT: Also if it is possible I would like some advice if it is possible to do it on your own (mostly) and how to do it? There are tons of free courses and I wonder if they are good start?",

Since then I haven't used it except to teach some IT.  I'm 41 and while I like teaching and have risen to some leadership positions, I can't see myself being a teacher for the next 20+ years.  So I'd like to change to a career in IT.  Of course that may mean a pay cut in the short term to get my foot in the door.\n\nAnyway, I find that I'm not really qualified for most of the jobs out there.  While some of my main subjects were programming with C#.NET and C, I feel that I just scraped through them and wouldn't feel confident applying for jobs in these areas.  While I enjoyed databases I feel I'd need a refresher since I haven't use them since.  \n\nSo what I'm wondering is what I could study/practice in the next 6-12 months to make me more employable?  I would be interested Data Analytics, but I haven't really learnt python (just beginners courses a few times).  I did statistics in 1st year uni and have taught high school maths to Year 11.  Also would be interested in any sort of programming, I have played with C# a lot, although would need a refresher on the web part of it and/or incorporating databases.   I'm probably not too interested in security or network type jobs.\n\nI'd be grateful for any advice.",

        "title": "Question for hiring managers - UK Graduate - Using job offer from one company as leverage to get a job from another - do I need to prove this to new employer with signed contract?",
        "body": "So I have had an 'almost' job offer from the company that I did my final year project with, they have already gotten a picture of me to do client stuff with, and have said for me to talk to them on Monday to finalise things, told me I wont need an interview, and the position isn't being offered to anyone else, and already told me the day they want me to start. So although I don't have an official offer from them yet Its pretty darn close.\n\nNow I don't want the job, and in order to not let them down I want to find a new one asap before my start date in 7 weeks. I have [read online](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/should-i-share-offer-details-with-other-opportunity-quora-vicki-salemi) that telling hiring managers about my current offer in the other jobs ill be interviewing for will help my case, as it shows employability.\n\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is if I can stop progress with the company that has offered me a job (verbally but non contractually), save myself and them a lot of time and effort, and then just tell a white lie to the new interviewers and say I already have a job offer, and get that same leverage (as I near as dammit do have the offer, just not in paper) Or will a situation come up where the new potential employer says 'Oh okay if you have been offered a job then prove it by showing us the contract'?\n\nIf the latter then I need to continue the pantomime with the old company until they give me the offer letter, It will be a let down for them, more work for me, but at the end of the day I 100% want to be able to use this job offer as leverage, so if that means I need an offer letter then thats what I have to do. If the former and I can get away with a harmless white lie (because I basically do have the offer), then it saves a load of effort with no harm done. But I want to hear the opinion of hiring managers before I do anything stupid or anything that could be considered mal practice.",

        "body": "Hey all, so to give some context I went to a coding boot camp and was not great with programming once I was done, go figure. However, I did manage to get a job due to my experience with video editing and design. The boss at the time had hired me understanding I was weak in code and was brought in to do more design work on their existing site.\n\nAt first, it was okay, it was me, him, and another chap who had been working there for about a year and was good at programming. It started well, designed a few things, got the general designs programmed, and working while learning on the job. It felt pretty good to start, but this didn't last too long.\n\nAs the boss\u2019 ambitions grew he needed me to code more and more, working on chat bots for a phone app, and things definitely outside my comfort but still things I enjoyed. It was fun to learn and see the learning take shape! As things went on though he began to start getting verbally abusive. I would be yelled at for not having some work done when I hadn't been given deadlines, I would be forced to rush code to make demo days, which meant bad code that later needed fixing but the boss would berate me for the quality and then be frustrated when the team said we need to fix it. \n\nAfter 8 months we brought in a very smart programmer who mentored me a bit but noticed my boss would single me out. He would ask what history I had with him to warrant his constant frustration to which I explained I didn't. I just sort of became the guy to point out because I was the weakest link. Mind you I tried really hard to keep improving, but my fiance was very ill and I had to take care of her as well.\n\nAfter a year the company went under and I was offered to keep working without promise of lay which I refused. It's been 2 years since then and a part of me really wants to get back into it...but I feel like I have this, crazy potent hesitancy the moment in about to start. Like I freeze up and panic or something, and then I go back to doing something else, sometimes nothing else.\n\nHave any of you had an experience like this and found a way to find that passion again? I find myself wanting to feel that spark of learning something and seeing it develop before me, but I constantly choke now and I just don't know where to even begin anymore.\n\nThanks for even just reading this it's been a while but I haven't spoken to many people about it, it just helps to even type it out lol",

        "body": "Hey all,\n\nSo i've worked at a very small agency for the last four years as their only full time developer. I've primarily worked with Wordpress and React applications, working with Laravel on the backend. I am comfortable on the backend, especially with Node and PHP, but primarily am interested in a front end role as I find FE more enjoyable and feel much more proficient with it. My experience with React consists of mostly working on a single application from our client for the last 2 years, multiple platforms, payment processing, authentication etc. \n\nI've become a bit unhappy with my current position, both with the pay and the quality of work we are outputting (being a sole developer with basically only help from my boss who is acting as project manager, I often feel we aren't doing things right or efficiently). So I have recently been applying and looking for other opportunities, preferably working on a product rather than hopping between client projects like I'm currently doing with my current company.\n\nOver last three weeks, I've been interviewing with a company for a senior frontend position that has their offices local to me. Publicly traded company, very well known, revenue increasing exponentially, with what seems to be a very large and cohesive engineer team. Furthermore, the salary range that I've been given for the position from the company recruiter is almost TRIPLE my current salary im earning. \n\nI've just finished my 4th interview with them, and have killed all the interviews thus far.. Their stack is identical to what I've been building for our client for the last 2 years, and using technologies that I genuinely enjoy using like React + CSS Modules. They also are very happy about my previous agency experience as they are looking for developers who are able to context-switch easily. Im moving on to what seems to be my last set of interviews next week with some stakeholders and the president of the company, and although im still not betting on anything, it seems that Im closing in at receiving an offer from the company for the position.\n\nFor each stage of the interview, I have looked up the interviewer and their experience. Most if not all of the interviewers have at least a year or two more experience than me, and have worked for various different companies as i really only have experience at a single agency. For me, I have experience with the processes of a single company and am worried I dont have the leadership and decision making skills that someone who has worked with a larger variety of React applications would have. \n\nI do have bad bouts of imposter syndrome, but I also consider myself cognizant enough to realize when I am out of my wheel house or when Im capable of something. \n\nIs it normal for someone transitioning from a mid-level role to a senior role to feel this way? If I seem like Im able to confidently answer the algorithm, design, and decision-making questions that are asked in the interview about their current technologies, should this be enough to ease myself that Im what they are looking?\n\nI apologize ahead of time if the post is a bit sporadic; having a hard time putting what im feeling into words. Just looking for advice from someone who has possibly transitioned from a mid-level to a senior-level role and what to expect compared to a lower-experience position.",

        "title": "Opinions/Advice on attending a vocational school before pursuing a bachelor's degree? (IT certification, and Computer Science degree)",
        "body": "TLDR// I plan on getting an IT certification at a vocational school before pursuing a bachelor's in comp sci. I'll be making more money in IT than I would be working at McDonald's, so putting myself through college will be less of a strain. I'll also come out of University with 4 years of work experience in the tech field.\n\nPlease bear with me as this is my first post. I'm a senior in high school approaching graduation and have already been accepted to a reputable four-year institution, but am not ready for the financial strain that comes with being a student. I'll be graduating with roughly a 2.7/ GPA (unweighted), and a 32 composite score on the ACT. I was discouraged from looking into scholarship opportunities, due to my low GPA (a huge mistake on my part). I come from a low-income family, and thus am not receiving much aid (other than FAFSA). I plan on attending a vocational school for one year to receive a skills certificate in IT. For the tech nerds like myself that are interested in specifics, the course is CompTia based and seems well rounded. It provides students with insight into Network+, A+, Linux+, Cloud+, and Security+. It's is a year-long, costs roughly four thousand dollars and totals out to be 900 hours worth of schooling. After finishing the course, I plan on pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science, or Computer Engineering (something of the sort). Ideally, I would be working part-time throughout college in IT to support myself financially. Working in IT, as opposed to a minimum wage job, would allow me to work fewer hours to get paid roughly the same. Additionally, by the end of my college career, I'll have racked up four years of work experience in the tech field, consequently making me more valuable to future employers.\n\nSidenote// If anyone has any suggestions that pertain to finding scholarships after having graduated high school, or alternative plans please let me know!",

        "body": "Hey everyone,   \nI'm sure this question has been asked in the past, but I'm looking to get a broader opinion. In short, I'm looking to take a coding bootcamp and am having a tough time making a choice. I'm based outside of Toronto, and I've looked at bootcamps within the area, but ultimately I've come down to two BrainStation and General Assembly.\n\nA little background about me, I went to university for Electrical Engineering and have worked as a Project Engineer and Design Engineer since graduating in 2017. For the past few months I've been self-teaching Python and AI (HarvardX AI cert on EdX and a few others on Coursera), but have been looking to move towards Full-Stack. The reason I'm looking into a bootcamp is to better structure my curriculum to be more regimented as I've been mainly exploring the different avenues I could pursue in programming. \n\nBrainstation covers HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React/Node.js/MySQL (from what I've heard, mostly focused on the front end).\n\nGeneral Assembly covers HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React/Node.js/MongoDB/Python/Django/PostgresSQL (also from what I've heard, more back-end oriented).\n\nI'm looking to get some insight as to whether one bootcamp's stack would better prepare me for the continued self-teaching I'll have to do after the bootcamp. i.e. Would it be better to focus more on front-end with BrainStation as they're heavier in the JS domain? Or would it be better to focus more on the back-end with General Assembly and have a broader familiarization?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

In order of preference, I guess it would be startup -> telecom -> government but since it's literally my first job out of uni, anything is honestly okay. They also pay around the same amount with the startup paying a bit more I imagine. However, the government & telecom positions are Jr SWE positions while the startup is a standard SWE position.\n\nHere are some of my questions & concerns\n\n* Do I tell each company that I'm also currently being interviewed by 2 other companies or do I say nothing?\n* I feel like the government position and the telecom position will have a very quick and easy interview process while the startup might be longer and include typical rounds of leetcode. If this is the case and I get an offer from the government/telecom but I'm still in the process of interviewing with the startup, what do I do?\n* In terms of salary, I've read some posts where people have leveraged offers to get more money. Is this something I should even attempt as a new grad without much experience?\n* Given the choices of the three opportunities, which would you pick? Government, Telecom, Startup?\n\nThank you!

I could possibly negotiate some more programming responsibilities into the job as well. \n\nI'm fairly certain that the second job will look better on a resume in the fall because it has at least a little programming experience.\n\nwould you play it safe and take the second option to get a minor boost on your resume to maybe get a good internship next spring or summer, or risk it for the first option and potentially get a SWE internship, with an ultimate goal being to become a software engineer after university.",

        "body": "Long time lurker here\n\nMy dream company to work for is Jane Street Capital in the New York office. I'm intrigued by the fact that they primarily use OCaml for the sake of code clarity and from what I know the culture seems pretty good. I do also know, however, that it's notoriously hard to get into. I'd like to know if anyone has any insight on how to maximize chances of getting in like what to put on my resume, what things to study and practice before the interview, etc.\n\nA bit about me, I'm a math major with a CS minor with 3.7 GPA from an alright-to-decent school. My work experience consists of one data science internship where I didn't do much and I currently work at Amazon and approaching the 4 year mark so I want to switch to something else once I get all my stocks. I don't really have any side projects and wouldn't call myself a super good programmer, I am only particularly comfortable in Java and Python and don't know many software engineering tools other than tools internal to Amazon. To be honest I think I lucked out on my Amazon interview because my raw programming skill is kind of weak. However I am decently good at puzzles/riddles and so I think I can understand complicated algorithms conceptually but I would need to practice a lot to be able to code them out. I never did competitive programming or anything like that but I did well in advanced algorithms courses which were based on pseudo code and proofs and diagrams. Also, as a math major, I found big O to be pretty easy compared to the kinds of math I did in my program. I don't think I would have any trouble analyzing the run time of programs and finding places where there could be optimizations.\n\nI'd be super interested in knowing what my chances of making it to the interview are and if anyone has any ideas for things I should practice or improve on to maximize my chance of getting in. I heard that Jane Street doesn't usually interview people who failed an interview with them before and so I'd like to get it right the first time. And while I went to a pretty good school I don't think it's a target school so that also hurts my chances, and I'm not sure what their GPA cutoff is or if there even is one. But I think my math background could be appealing to them. Any advice would be super appreciated, thanks!",

What do you all think my prospects are? ***I'm specially worried*** that companies won't want me because they might think: \"this person has no perseverance since they committed to a PhD but ended up dropping it\" or \"this person is too dumb for us since they couldn't even exit their PhD program with a Masters\". Is there a standard way of saying you're planning to dropout (in your resum\u00e9 or during interviews) without sounding like a quitter?\n\nIf you are wondering, here is a bit more about my background. I did by undergrad in pure math at a top school in the US and went straight to my current PhD program after that. ***I have no internships*** or previous experience (in CS or finance) except for a quantitative trading internship this summer at a top firm. My coding is decent (Python and C++, I can do LeetCode or CodeForces problems) but I don't have any projects to prove it.

However, I have recently received a competitive offer from a tech company based in Seattle and their offer explodes in 3 days. (They are fully aware that I recently started at another company)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe team I am on at my current company (financial one) is not legacy or boring work. I am working on features for a new financial application that will be released in the coming months. However, my onboarding has been a shitshow but it's slowly getting better... I am not sure the team knew that I was joining LOL I would say this financial company would be considered the top bank/investment institution in the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe team at the tech company is a customer data backend-focused team. Not the most exciting team but I got the chance to actually meet the team and the hiring manager during the interviews.  The company is a not FAANG tier, but it is a company most people have heard about before and is a company you would find in Silicon Valley. The culture and team seem awesome and seem like an awesome place to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo basically if I were to leave my current company, I would be blacklisted by the financial world possibly... my question is what is best for my career? (Salary, Learning, Career Progress, etc...) My goal is to learn as much as a developer as possible to eventually start my own startup and to earn as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould greatly appreciate any advice or opinions from you guys!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

I ended up leaving my next job due to wanting to work in a different technology stack. The next place I worked put me in a position where they cut my pay massively hoping I would quit so they didn't have to pay me unemployment due to me underperforming in my position and I just got let go from my job yesterday where they claimed \"the company was going in a different direction\" and they wanted more senior level developers on the team. I assume that's true, but I still get the impression they thought I might have been underperforming based on other parts of that conversation. \n\nI'm job hunting now and am trying to figure out what I should be looking for in order to work at a place long term and grow as a developer in order to fill in any possibile gaps in knowledge I have so I can improve. I'm sticking to postings that specifically say entry level or junior to be on the safe side. I have a lot of experience mainly with web technologies like html/css/JavaScript and PHP/MySQL. I just spent the last year and 8 months using codeigniter at my last job and got really familiar with it, but it seems like a lot of companies are moving away from these types of frameworks and  stacks in favor of AWS services and js frameworks. I have some exposure to AWS (completed an associate solutions architect course, but haven't passed the exam yet) and have been learning Vue but don't have any production experience with it and a lot of companies are looking for 2+ years even in junior positions. I assume this is a fairly common situation to be in in, how have others death with this and how have you found your groove?",

I got a job at a healthcare company writing SQL and SSRS reports. 3 years later I got promoted to a new position working with MS Dynamics. \n\nThe company and culture, while corporate and corny at times, is anything but toxic. I feel valued and rewarded for my hard work. Management is supportive and it\u2019s a very collaborative atmosphere. Office politics exist I\u2019m sure but I don\u2019t have to worry about them. PTO is generous and so is the pay. \n\nBut I just can\u2019t focus. I\u2019m just not interested in any of this shit. It was the same with both the SQL and dynamics positions, which as tools are both fine and kind of fun to work with, but in the context of healthcare and the corporate world I just really have trouble staying on top of all the meetings, different projects, terminology, processes, ect. I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed. I swear to god sometimes a meeting will just land on my calander with zero context and people will talk to me as if I\u2019m an expert in whatever it is they\u2019re talking about but I literally have no clue.

I the meantime 6 other things will be piled onto my plate. Sometimes I finish shit without understanding what I did or what it\u2019s for.\n\nMy honest feelings are that I don\u2019t give a shit about my job. I just want to develop my games but I\u2019m not naive, I know putting it all on the line in the hopes my little indie game will take off is a dumb move... I just can\u2019t stand the office life. I feel like I\u2019m so stressed out for no reason. I exercise regularly and whatnot but I feel like my body is in worse shape than when I was landscaping lol\n\nPart of me wants to go back to blue collar life and just make my games on the side, but I would need to pick up an actual trade to support the house and kids. \n\nIdk how bad did I fuck up here in going down this path?",

        "body": "I've been working in one of big companies developing custom OS for several years. My activities included developing userspace services, custom libc and some S/W parts of the proprietary kernel. This was a job I really liked; the only reason I left it was a lack of understanding how tech processes should work. For several years, me and many my colleagues tried to change the situation, with little to no success; when most of talented colleagues left, I felt that the project stagnates, and also took an uneasy decision to leave.\n\nAnyway, even after some months passed, I feel that I really miss what I did there. I really liked the job, only political questions or absurd management made it less attractive. I would really like to find some project which is concentrated around the stuff I used to do. I'm particularly interested in concepts like capabilities, TCB, object-oriented; OSes and frameworks which attract me most include Fuchsia, Capsicum, Windows (not API-wise, though) and similar. I mostly dealt with C over these years; my C++ skills are rusty. Anyway, language is not a problem, I can learn new languages as well; I simply prefer C.\n\nAn ideal project would be:\n\n* An operating system which is aware of Orange Book and TCB, and tries to follow these principles to at least some extent.\n* Mostly userspace activities, like libc development, implementing miscellaneous services, perhaps even RPC to some degree.\n* It'd be perfect if I could operate on kernel/userspace boundaries, e.g. implementing new system calls or other kernel<=>userspace interfaces.\n* Preferably the significant part is written in C, which I know much better than anything else; other languages are not a problem, the C is simply the favorite one.\n* The project has some space for an architect.\n* The job is remote.\n\nOf course, I realize that it's rather difficult to meet all these criteria; I mostly shown them for an illustration of what I like and prefer. I tried investigating many jobs available, but, given somewhat narrowed scope, it's difficult to find something. Most vacancies for C developer I checked deal with either firmware or hardware; whilst I'd really like to become proficient in these areas as well, I'd like to at least start with fields where I feel myself already proficient enough. That said, I'm OK to use languages other than C, and participate in projects which deal with other userspace parts; above is an ideal image of the world, I realize it's close to impossible to find something that specific.\n\nI'm struggling to find something which matches my interests, and would be glad for any tip. Finding a job which matches these criteria via search engines is difficult, if not impossible, but perhaps real people can give me an advice?\n\nUPD: I also should mention that quite a lot of my activities recently concerned taking architectural solutions, publishing designs on implementations and similar actions.",

In the past two weeks I have interviewed for 10 different positions at 9 different companies.\n\nThis past Wednesday I interviewed in person (weird, I know) with a small company about a 30 min drive from me. I really enjoyed the interview and they really enjoyed me as well. The CTO walked me out and told me she sincerely enjoyed the interview.\n\nFast forward to today where I am moving on to the second step of the interview process (out of 2 or 3 steps) with the company I have wanted to work with this entire time. They are one of the best companies to work for in the entire state. Not only that, but I am interviewing for two different jobs with this company.\n\nThe issue is that the small company said they move fast and will let me know mid next week if I get the job, and while I cannot be totally sure they will send me an offer, I do feel very good about it. At the same time, the bigger company I am interviewing with can move a little bit slower. I do not want to reject the small offer just in hopes that the larger company sends an offer. What is the best way to handle this situation?\n\nShould I inform the large company at the end of the interview that I am expecting an offer from the small company sometime next week? And that I would rather work for them, but do not want to screw up my chances with the smaller company? Do I let the small company know that I am waiting on results from the large company?\n\nI do not want to piss either off and have them send rejections. They are both great opportunities.

My Chinese is getting a bit rusty so I might have missed a few details, but this seems to be what happened: \n\nThere's this intern from Peking University who worked Jan - Apr and told her leader that she wants to leave in April because they're busy with graduating. The leader said no because she didn't find a replacement for her position and told her to keep working. After May 1st, a junior of the leader's joined the team, so OP wrote a 10,000 character transitional document and asked to quit on May 11th again, but the leader said that OP still couldn't leave because the backup wasn't found by the OP. On top of that, the leader said to OP that their working skills are really bad and they have to find two backups (replacements) to fill the holes in her work and questioned OP why they couldn't find a replacement when everyone else could. \n\nOP's post then goes into detail about legality (no mention of needing to find a replacement before leaving), violence at the workplace (OP's roommate's leader told the roommate that \"leaving without finding a replacement is irresponsible\", and when OP brought this issue to HR, HR said that OP was arguing about semantics / denying that the leader had said such a thing), why they needed two backups (was she doing two people's work?), and double standards (a roommate of hers didn't need to find a backup to leave, so why would she need to?). \n\nHope we can have a discussion about this here.\n\nEDIT: Sorry about using \"she\" in the title. Not too sure about OP's gender.",

        "body": "&#x200B;\n\nHey. I graduated from university a year ago and have been working for a year as a back-end engineer. I was applying during peak COVID so I took the first decent job I found. The work is ok for me (I like designing APIs), the people are great, the work-life balance is impeccable but for my experience and skillset, I'm being grossly underpaid ($72k/y +8k bonus) (HCOL).\n\n I don't think there is much room for working on newer projects at my current company (cut and dry, develop this feature, fix this bug, etc).  I very much want to leave for a company that will pay me more, and allow me to work with engineers that I can learn from. The only redeeming quality about this company is that I only have to work like \\~15h a week MAX. No micromanaging.\n\nI know that I'm being underpaid, so I've been grinding LC for the past 3 months and I'm making steady progress. I've been taking all the SWE interviews I can get just for the practice and recently I've been offered a glorified Sales Engineer job. The comp is \\~120K + 15-20k bonuses. This is basically 50K more than I make now. The role doesn't sound very appealing, but from what I can gather they want someone to come to develop tools and scripts to automate their demo environment (so there would be some SWE). \n\nRegardless, I would still keep grinding LC if I took this job because I don't want to end up in the sales engineering world. **Will taking this job hurt my ability to pivot back to a pure SWE role?**  Would you give up insane WLB + vacation days for 50K for a temporary role as a sales engineer?\n\nRight now I'm still confused. An extra (50k / y) would be extremely great, I just don't want to hurt my ability to get back into an SWE role... \n\nAlso, this company I'm currently at is working at knows I want a raise, and I've been vocal about it but I'm met with nothing but lip service.\n\nTLDR: \n\noption A: stay at current company, maybe get a 10-15k raise within the year, continue to work on CRUD APIs but not work with newer tech stacks / develop my skills that much.\n\noption B: go to company B, make $50k more at least, and do something I also don't particularly enjoy, that moves outside of the SWE world, and continue to study.",

My manager and teammates are great and I get along very well with everyone. I use a modern, in-demand tech stack and am paid well above market rate. With that said, my time here has been extremely challenging. I work longs hours yet am doing much less coding than I anticipated. The breakdown is approximately:\n\n30% \u2014 Development. We do not have dedicated QA or ops teams, so a good portion of this time is spent either testing or handling build/deployment issues.\n\n25% \u2014 Docs, investigations, proposals, etc. Every change at this company requires time-consuming processes and external approval.\n\n20% \u2014 On-call activities. We have frequent week-long stretches of 24 hour on-call where getting multiple pages per day is the norm. We are expected to work a backlog of on-call-related tasks when not actively working a page, so I do not touch code while on-call.\n\n15% \u2014 Monotonous, repetitive tasks. This includes enabling feature flags and manual testing for things that we cannot automate.\n\n10% \u2014 Meetings.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how normal this is for a junior, but I suspect it is not normal at all.\n\nI have discussed the issue with my manager multiple times. He pays lip service to correcting the imbalance but I feel that I am stuck in an endless cycle of activities that are not enriching my skill-set as a developer. I have some interesting projects lined up but they require many hours of investigation and proposals before I\u2019ll touch any code.\n\nMy biggest concern is that my experience looks good on paper but, in reality, is lacking. Future employers may expect more from me than I am capable of delivering, given my sub-par experience at my current job.\n\nI am not sure how long I will stay with this company; I am in my 30s and want something more laid back and without so much on-call. However, I worry about leaving my first job too soon and how this may be perceived by future employers.\n\nIs this what modern software development is like at big companies? Am I doing something wrong? Is there anything I can do to improve my situation?\n\nAny feedback is very much appreciated.\n\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone who has replied so far.

I guess this is all caused by years of being in the engineering school and building the imposter syndrome, and having to be like that for all those job interviews. \n\nI also think ever since I started working from home I keep having the urge to log in to my work laptop again after work hours, I really don't feel \"done\" for the day if that makes sense. \n\nAnyone dealt with those issues before? And how did you overcome them? \n\nThanks !",

        "body": "I recently started a job as an Android dev for a mid size tech company that you likely haven't heard of working remote. I've only been there for 2 months and a little before that they hired a new CEO. The new CEO is highly unpopular from what I gather and is a very old school \"ass in seats\" type of guy. I kept seeing emails about the new \"DC office\" and how they were targeting that area.\n\nThe listings for their jobs that were remote shrank significantly and they are all targeted towards Washington, DC now. I didn't think much of this until I started seeing engineer after engineer leave. 4 people from my small team left in a month along with other big time departures like the president of the company. It was very hush hush as to why  they departed and they all \"left on good terms\". \n\nSo then I see some Glassdoor reviews pop up, and they keep saying the same thing: the new CEO wants people to move and work out of DC and that's why people are leaving. Well, I live in Phoenix so there is no fucking way I'm going to move my entire family to DC out of the blue. \n\nMy manager hasn't said a thing about this to me, but I keep getting emails talking about DC and people leaving. So at this point it's just a rumor, but seems to have some substance behind it. \n\nIf this does happen it will count as a lay off right? I am hesitant about looking for a new job right now because I don't want a 2-4 month stint on my resume and then having to explain why. This is just an overall potentially a very shitty situation and I'm not sure what to do.",

I feel like I don't deserve my place there, and as the date of the internship is approaching, me receiving my work laptop , I'm feeling more and more as an intruder. I knew the company beforehand, and their techstack and projects are so appealing to me, but I just can't help feeling like this.  \n\n\nHow can I make this feeling go away?

The VP (who isn't the hiring manager) said it can't go higher. I know that isn't true. Also, on the internal hire portal there's some jobs with a level higher. \n\nIs it dickish of me to not want the job without the higher level? The team is a pet project of the business leader, but it's a shaky project that I'm not sure can succeed. With a level up, I'm a bit more protected in a severance situation with the company. The VP wants me to talk to the Hiring Manager some more and was going to discuss the levelling with him. Is it realistic?",

        "body": "Hello,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I have made some mistakes in my career, luckily I think they have been early enough is isn't to late to try and salvage the situation. I am curious to hear everyone's take on what is going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was working at a fairly large military contractor for last part of my schooling, and worked full time for a year (graduated in April). So started in Jan of last year and left in Feb. This job was great actually really enjoyed it, there was those days where I hated it but for the most part everyone was super collaborative, interesting work, modern stack, and not much to complain about. Then they started doing restructuring they ended up selling my team   to another company, got put on a new team, then that new team started getting dissolved, and I basically was unsure about my job and what was really going on. In addition to every thing that was going on after talking to other friends I realized I was getting pretty underpaid compared to market value for the area, I was getting paid 72k, and most places were 80-90.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now, I took a new job that is fully remote (it's local but they gave me the option to work remote), the job paying a lot better $110, which honestly probably is way to much, but hey they offered it.  However that is where this drama just barely starts. So this job has a TON of technical debt, more so then what they originally told me.  They have a backlog of almost a year plus worth of bugs, angular 8, and what not.  With this technical debt there are lot of bugs (I would say 70% of backlog items), many of which aren't even fixable with current stack, or super hard to trouble shoot.   \n\n\nAs we fix issues there is no current process to really test against production environment, and QA testers also are stuck with half testing it. So with that we fix things and it introduces other small things, or maybe it wasn't possibly fixed. Which is fine, but it is difficult cause all of these come back to look like its my fault.. Which our team is really small its me and one other guys (which doesn't do a ton). But lately I feel like everything has been a complete mess, and everyone is playing the blame game, and complaining stuff is not getting done fast enough. Which is the furthest from the truth. Which I think my manager would back me up, but I can tell hes starting to get frustrated with everything that is going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that I have started to document every single thing I'm working on, what I found, who I worked with, just if something was to hit the fan. But I  basically am worried that based off past stories I have heard one day I will just go in and they will let me go. (I guess they dont usually hire full time (as I am), looking at the company states 80% of work force is contracted employees) Which this was my worry all along because I know looking like a job hopper is not good. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are plenty of other stuff going on with the company, which honestly is just shady (they've been lying to 3rd parties, and I have to say stuff particular way or they get stuck paying more money). Just to list a few..  I'm worried if I'm let go it basically sets me up for a super bad looking resume and 100% a job hopper.... Feel like it's a touch situation to be in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAppreciate any insights/experiences you may have had.",

        "title": "Wtf is going on with my recruiter???",
        "body": "Hi Redditors, I ran into the strangest situation this week and am looking for some thoughts and advice on what to do.\n\n**TL;DR:** As a contractor, I applied for an internal FTE position for the same role under my current manager that I was basically told I would for sure get. After my interviews and all positive feedback from them, recruiting won't move forward with my application. Could the recruiter have something against me or a vested interest to hire external candidates?\n\nDetails:\n\nI'm currently work as a contractor at a fairly large tech company via a consulting company. There's an opening for a full time position on my team for the same role that I'm working in now. (FYI, it's not SDE but similar.) I joined late last year and am doing well, so my manager (who's also the hiring manager for the position) recommended me to apply. Unfortunately, since it's a bigger company with a lot of rules, there's no simple conversion from contractor to FTE - I have to go through the full interview process. My manager basically told me this would just be a formality and my interviews would mostly be with people on our team whom I already work with.\n\nI finished all the interviews and got positive feedback during all of them. After a week, I asked my manager if there any updates and he said he hasn't heard from recruiting. So I reached out to recruiting asking when I can expect to hear and they said they're still debriefing other candidates and will get back to me when that's done.\n\nThe thing is, it's kind of strange but I was also asked to help out as interviewer for the same position that I am applying to since there are two FTE positions open for this role. Since I'm the only person doing this work right now on the team and whoever else we hire will be working closely with me, my manager wanted me to be an interviewer. So I interviewed a couple other candidates the same week I had my own interview. Recruiting held a debrief session with the interviewers - including me - and the candidates got the decisions within 3 days after their interviews. We didn't hire them. (Btw, I'm not involved as an interviewer anymore, because recruiting found out that I was a contractor and there is some rule that contractors can't be interviewers for FTE positions.)\n\nSo now it's been \\~2 weeks after my own interviews and I still haven't heard anything. I asked my manager about this again today. He said he's asked recruiting several times to move forward with setting up the debrief meeting for me, but that they \"seemed to be ignoring his requests.\" He told me that even though recruiting doesn't have a say in who gets hired, he is dependent on them to coordinate the process.\n\nI wonder why this recruiter assigned to me is refusing to move forward with my application? I haven't talked to them in person outside of a couple email exchanges, all very brief and polite from both sides. Even the initial \"recruiter screen\" and scheduling the interviews were done by other people. So I don't think they have anything against me personally, but perhaps they have a vested interest to hire the candidates that are sourced/introduced by them? Has anyone heard of this happening?\n\nWhat should I do in this situation?? Can this recruiter actually block me from being hired? At this rate, they will continue delaying my application while they continue bringing in new candidates. And I'll be forced to extend my contract after it ends next month (and obviously, not guaranteed that I can continue extending in the future) and miss out on this FTE opening.",

Just get things done first for customer, and deal with the rest later. For e.g. design a db in a way that it leverages the existing code as much as possible to get things done on time. Now a year later, it became a performance bottleneck, and the code is already coupled enough. It has grown a lot and become risky to make big changes.

I am grateful that working there opened my eyes to the management side of development.\n\nLater on for my capstone project, my professor had us split up into teams of 10 and create a fake startup based on a skeleton of an app he gave us. I decided to take a swing at being the Scrum Master. I really liked the role, and the instructor told me that I should go get a Scrum Master Certification. My question is, isn't the Scrum Master role usually reserved for after someone is a senior developer? Would anyone hire me to be an agile coach at a company where most of the people will be older than me? Should I just spend a few years in the field first? \n\nI'm posting here because I know I'm not a star coder (I barely touch my leetcode account), but I spent a lot of time in my college career being a leader in different organizations on campus and mentoring freshman students. I love tech, but I also find that I feel more fulfilled when I'm helping people.  So where do I go from here?",

        "body": "Hey everyone. \n\nSo, I was lucky to be able to get a great programming job right out of college. Great pay for my first job, with raises contractually guaranteed once I learn the language used... The problem is that the language in question is Perl (along with MySQL). \n\nNow, I realize that Perl is still used in programming. However, it is not common. Due to my spouse's line of work, I will eventually have to move, meaning that I will eventually need a new job. \n\nBasically, my question is this: would staying in this job for the next few years (3-5+) hurt my chances of employment later due to not using a \"popular\" programming language? The main programming languages that I used in college were Python and Java, so I'm a tad concerned that Perl is no longer what employers are looking for. \n\nShould I do side projects in other programming languages to \"stay relevant\" while I use Perl at work? Is Perl actually a great language that a lot of jobs are using after all? Any advice would be great. Thank you!",

I've already been working as a programmer for about a year now for $55k a year. The recruiter told me the salary range for the new job is $70k - $85k annually. This is in medium/high cost of living city in the Midwest.\n\nI'm familiar with ASP.NET Core, however this company uses the older ASP.NET Framework which I'm not familiar with. During the technical interview I really struggled due to this and I'm surprised they're wanting to move forward with me. I did promise to study ASP.NET in my free time to catch up, and I mean it. They also asked for a Bachelors degree and 3+ years experience, neither of which I have. \n\nI'm also concerned if working with such an outdated technology will have long term effects on my career, although currently I am working with WPF so that's only slightly better. \n\nThe recruiter said they're thinking $65k to $70k to offer me. Based on COL where they're located,  $65k wouldn't even be a raise. So if they do offer, I'm going to ask for $80k because I know that's in their range, does that seem reasonable?\n\nAs a follow up, I like the job I have now and would happily stay if they matched the salary.

        "body": "Hello! So I'm a new grad who's been applying to places for a while and I've only started the interview process and haven't gotten an offer yet but I just wanted to ask you guys for your opinion. I guess I'll just list out the pros and cons and general thoughts. Also if it matters, I'm in Canada.\n\nSo on one hand, the pay is very very good, especially for a junior swe position without much experience. The only experience I have is doing a bit of freelancing stuff while I was in university. On the other hand, it's only an 8 month or so long position with the possibility of an extension afterwards. This is the main thing that's bothering me because I know that it's basically all about getting that first position and having like 2 years under your belt and it gets easier from there so I was hoping to land a good job for 2 years and try to get into some FAANG type company. With it being a government job, I've also heard it's kind of slow paced and boring but obviously there's various departments and the requirements were pretty new tech (which I've used and am comfortable with) so maybe that won't be the case. I'm also definitely a night owl and was hoping to join a tech company with flexible hours if possible but that's definitely the least of my worries.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty sure I should take the offer if given to me, but I would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThanks!",

        "title": "Job changed dramatically recently, getting red flags?",
        "body": "I'm the lead engineer on a small team at a non-tech company (I refer to my work as \"enterprise software development\"). It's just me and a few juniors. My boss is an architect, kind of. I'll also add that I'm a decent developer, but by no means am I \"FAANG-worthy\".\n\nI've really enjoyed my job up until recently. I've had agency to implement things however I want, and I took that opportunity to make sure we were doing everything in a forward-thinking and well thought-out way, even if that meant taking a few hours/days to try a few things out. By doing this, I learned a lot and even got to build some really neat solutions to problems we encountered while trying to build as smartly as possible.\n\nSome time ago, our CTO decided he wanted our company to be more tech-focused, and chose my boss's team to sort of spear-head this move. Since then, a lot of what we've been developing has been proofs of concept for different business-units, who are used to finding external vendors for technical needs. There was, understandably, considerable push-back to a lot of our work, because change isn't easy--it never is.\n\nThis sort of came to a head a few weeks ago when I was working on a 1-2 week PoC for some business unit (important information: we're a global company, so sometimes there's a language barrier when speaking with other business units). Throughout the development process I kept my boss informed. I told him what I understood the problem to be and how I planned to implement it. I then had him test it out and give me feedback so that I could make it really clean for the inevitable demo to the business unit who asked for it. He was on board... Until the day of the demo. We met (via zoom) to dry-run the demo and he told me, more or less, that in all of his conversations with the requesting business unit he'd never heard them complain about what my PoC aimed to solve, that he wasn't sure the product demo was going to go over well because of that. I was, I think understandably, upset. I asked him why he had approved of me working on this, why I hadn't gotten this feedback earlier, etc. and he just said \"I made a mistake\". Needless to say, the demo went poorly.\n\nThis is one instance, but we've been running into this similar issue (the poor demos, not the miscommunications) for a while and it's got me questioning my role at this company. Aside from this, I've been realizing lately that I have only been learning as much as I have because I chose to. There's not really anyone technical enough around me to give me feedback on my methods or talk through alternative options. Nobody would know if I built stuff in a shitty way, and that *feels* like a yellow, if not red, flag.\n\nThe relationship I have with my boss, which used to be very amicable and relatively close, has been strained by these turns of events, and the stress of work has started to bleed into my not-at-work life (I'm remote, so it's a figurative not-at-work).\n\nFinally, on Monday my boss told me I needed to let a few other folks (who I don't know and have never worked with) have access to our cloud-provider account (like, give them permission to create resources & all that). I asked him what sort of governance we were putting in place to make sure that nothing got out of hand, because it's my role to monitor our cloud-resources and when something's fishy, security comes after me, not him. He said, basically, that we can trust these folks, they're superior to me, etc. and that if security hassled me, I should just refer them to him instead. This feels messy and like it's just asking to be a pain in my neck long term.\n\nIs it time to start polishing my resume? Am I over-reacting? If I leave, it's just a bunch of juniors and an architect, and nobody really knows what we have other than myself (I keep our documentation available to everyone, but that doesn't mean they use it). The juniors would have no mentor and the architect hasn't written code in I don't know how long. I'm not, like, emotionally invested in the success of my employer, so leaving wouldn't really bother me, but I'm sort of at the point in my life where I'd like a \"career position\" so I wouldn't have to shop around for raises & whatnot every few years as is the norm in the tech world.

        "body": "I know this question/topic has been brought up multiple times on this sub, but I wanted to ask it again in the context of my personal experience. I'm currently going into my senior year at a top 10 university (top 10 overall, not necessarily for CS), and I'm studying CS and EE. After a few business/consulting-focused internships, I'm looking to go into tech as I feel it would be a waste not to apply my technical background, and I really am interested in the industry. I have some solid programming skills and projects (mostly from CS classes I've taken), so I think I would fair well as a SWE if I work hard enough, but I don't ever see myself being the \"best\" SWE, or even among the top 5-10% of developers. Thus, I am already planning on going into SWE for a few years, then transitioning into something else, like PM. \n\nI also know that PM roles are extremely hard to come by, and the best time to snag one would be right after graduation. I think I would enjoy a PM role and my skill set is more aligned for PM, but I am concerned about getting into a leadership-type role in tech straight out of college. Again, I will have a CS degree from a great school and have some decent programming experience, but I'm certainly not the best programmer around or someone who codes for fun in their free time. Thus, it seems like I would be out of place starting off as a PM right away and being tasked with leading a team of engineers who are much more skilled than me. \n\nI feel like if I start out in SWE and gain some legitimate technical experience, then I would be a far more effective leader and PM, but on the flip side, getting a role in PM after working in SWE is harder than getting one right out of college. Am I misconstruing what a PM really does or overestimating the technical ability required? I've always felt that my leadership style is most effective when I am as knowledgeable about a task as the people I am working with, but perhaps that is not how I should be looking at PM roles. If anyone has any advice on the decision between going into PM right after college vs transitioning into it after a few years of development experience, I would love to hear your thoughts. It's all really just a big bag of imposter syndrome, but I wouldn't want to start out in a career that I'm not yet suited for.",

        "body": "Hey everyone! As the title says, I will be starting my internship for a software engineering position this upcoming Monday but have recently developed a wandering left eye (strabismus) due to poor vision or partial vision in my left eye. I have a brain tumor which has caused me to have bad vision in both of my eyes for the past 4-5 years but my brain definitely has favored my right eye over my left eye. Whenever I focus on things my left eye drifts down. It only happens when I focus on things hard. If I am talking to someone or moving it isn\u2019t apparent and doesn\u2019t drift down. My question is should I tell my employer so they can accommodate for me(like bigger screen, use bigger font on programs, etc) when I start on Monday during orientation? I feel like I have to because whenever I program on my laptop now my eye drifts down and I don\u2019t want that to be an issue when I program. \n\nIf anyone has had or is having vision issues like mine please share your experience on how you have dealt or deal with it. I\u2019m not gonna let a lazy or wandering eye hinder me from programming since it something I love to do and enjoy a lot.",

I have a relatively firm understanding of how operating systems work and how to utilize some technical features. \n* I don't have a history of being very good at math, but that could be due to the quality and/or lack of teaching on the subject. \n* I have a lot of free time.  \n\n\nQuestions I have:\n\n* My brother is an IT Director and therefor has friends in the industry, but too busy to answer many questions. From a brief interaction I was told my career path depends on what \"stack\" I want to learn, and whether or not I want to work on the design or engineering side. **What is the most widely desired \"stack\"?**\n* I don't want to necessarily limit myself on my journey through education by focusing on either engineering vs. design, but... **Which \"type of programming\" is more in demand with the greatest potential of growth?**\n* **What should my path of education look like, including examples to use in my resume/job interviews that compensates for the lack of degree?**\n* **What kind of entry-level jobs could I expect with the education that is recommended to me by you, including pay range?**\n* If it's possible to answer, **What does an average day look like for you?**\n* **Is remote-work significantly more common, and will it remain that way for the foreseeable future?**  \n\n\nThanks in advance for your time.",

I had around 100 application out at the time just shotgunning for an entry level job, and got 2 responses back both negative. Everyone dropped their summer programs, like half of my college friends were fired from their internships before the first day. For a few months I bounced between doing resume stuffer projects and sending out applications. I was approaching around 200 applications total when I finally got a response from some IT contract position at the local school system. This was really sub-optimal but at this point I was desperate and was willing to work anywhere as long as it was with a computer. It was a good temporary job but I was really dissatisfied with it since the work was repetitive and really easy, not to mention the poor pay. I started applying more on linked in near the end of the contract, and by some miracle an honest-to-goodness software role wanted an interview with me. The interview was almost devoid of technical questions, was obviously just a means for the contracting agency to steal someone's paycheck, and I was hired within 3 days. The pay was not great but is was enough to where I could pay rent and get by. Fast forward 5 months of working remotely doing interesting but underpaid work and developing my stack, some college buddies recommended I try messaging a recruiter for a growing fintech company in my area. About a month of pestering the recruiter finally got me a interview, and I passed with flying colors. Now I have a full-time career with perfectly acceptable pay for a newish grad with great benefits. \n\nLesson being: life is shitty and unfair but if you keep trying you can get lucky and land a career starter. \n\nProgress overview:\n\n\\- 5/2020 with a BA in CS from UNC-CH\n\n\\- 5/2020-8/2020: no job and on the application/learning grind\n\n\\- 8/2020-11/2020: contract helpdesk job at local school 15/hr\n\n\\- 12/2020-5/2021: low wage contract research dev with the government 22/hr\n\n\\- 5/2021-present: average entry-level software dev job in fintech with average entry-level software job wage for the area 35/hr\n\nKeeping the jobs I have secret for anonymity but feel free to AMA.

By the time I transfer Covid hit and change everything for me and it\u2019s been a struggle to maintain grade which is why I declined expeditiously in my GPA.

        "body": "Hey guys, I'm finding myself in a weird spot in my career, and struggling to figure out how to move forward.\n\nFor context, I graduated in 19, and I've been working at one company since graduating.\n\nI work for a consulting firm in the Midwest. I know it's not the most glamorous job, but the pay and benefits were competitive for the area and at the time location was really important to me.\n\nShortly after I started working, someone requested that I transfer into their department with the promises of being able to work on exciting technologies and expand my skill set, in addition to being 100% remote. This obviously appealed to me so I signed on.\n\nThe reality of it was that the team that was being put together failed to sign a single contract. So, I was assigned to a project in the meantime to ensure I was billing hours. That project was a small dumpster fire, and was entirely ETL and SQL work.\n\nAfter a few months it was obvious that the project was not advancing my career. I wasn't learning new languages, new skills, or improving the ones I already had. I was working with legacy \"code\", and the client was not interested in improvements or optimizations. They just wanted the product to work, and pay as little as possible to maintain it. There was no incentive for me to learn how to improve or optimize the work I was doing as a result, and I didn't have the budget to explore those things even if I wanted to. Something to consider is that because of the projects problems I got a ton of experience working directly with clients, managing and deciding on budgets, resolution times ,etc. I did a lot of the work of the PM in this role, as our PM took a backseat on a lot of this work. I consider this to be great experience, even though it was stressful at the time, but I'm not sure how to leverage it when searching for jobs.\n\nA few months ago, my boss left our department despite never fulfilling his promises on the kind of work I'd be a part of. I really feel like this has set me back in a huge way.\n\nRecently I was transferred away from that project onto another project that is entirely SQL work. This is despite the fact that I've been very vocal about my concerns as regarding my career development.\n\nI have a bachelor's in CS and an OCA certification for Java, but it's been nearly two years since I've written real code. What do I need to learn/do to start putting myself in a position that I will be a competitive candidate for a role where I'll get to do what I actually want to do?\n\nMy interest right now is in full stack development, but I'm open to anything that really requires me to think and optimize and improve my work. Problem solving is what I love about this field, so if anyone has any other suggestions I'm all ears.\n\nI love working with backend languages like python, java, and C++, but recently I've been trying my hand at Javascript and found that to be pretty enjoyable too.\n\nI did create a small website using one of the main frameworks years ago, that had a front end/back end that worked and was hosted by a hosting service, so I know I can do it. But it's been so long that I can't quite remember the steps I need to take \n\nI'm currently taking an online course on Javascript (udemy) to try to get a really deep understanding of the language before I try my hand at properly learning a framework. My HTML and CSS skills are terrible (right now, but I'm sure I can improve with some elbow grease).\n\nI am moving closer to a larger city (30 min drive) so hopefully my options for employers will greatly expand once I make the move.\n\nIf anyone has any advice at all, I'd love to hear it. For anyone who made it this far, thanks so so much for taking the time.\n\n\nTL:DR; How do I transition from a primarily SQL based role into literally anything else where I get to write real code.",

        "body": "TL;DR: I've been transitioning to programming just from my own self-studying and guidance from my mentor, and I just wanted to get some feedback since I've been getting very antsy about securing a job. I have about 8 months of informal experience working with JavaScript/React, although I've been doing an internship for a month so far at a brand new start-up working on the MVP for a React chat app. Can I get a full-time (ideally tech) job with this kind of background? Any tips on how I can make that happen? I do have a mechanical engineering degree and some years of experience there, but yeah trying to switch to coding, which so far I like a lot better.\n\nFull background:\n\nI started learning JavaScript basics at the beginning of 2020 to get ready for a coding boot camp, but then the whole pandemic thing happened and I felt less inclined to do the boot camp's remote program. Fortunately, I had a close friend who's a Software Engineer and also had prior experience teaching at a boot camp, and he offered to teach me personally as my mentor. He put together his own curriculum tailored for me based on what he thought would be most beneficial, starting with some cs fundamentals, then more web fundamentals, and then finally putting together an actual web application with React. I spent a lot of time building it under his guidance, really making sure to have a polished final product for my portfolio and resume (you can check it out here if you like: [https://www.rolemate.io](https://www.rolemate.io/jobs))\n\nWith that experience, I was fortunately able to get a Software Engineering internship at a startup, where we're working on the very early stages of an app creating the MVP for a social app. It's been pretty good React experience as well as I've been working on new features with the guidance of the Senior Software Engineer.\n\nAnd of course, I've also been practicing with algorithms (my least favorite part) with an online course and just grinding away on different problems and mock interviews. This part is probably my weakest area and I'm still struggling to get solutions consistently.\n\nAnd that's pretty much where I'm at. I've been sending out a BUNCH of applications but haven't gotten a single response besides the internship. Is there any hope for me with my unconventional background?? I'd appreciate any feedback and insights!",

I'm not sure what to pick. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* If I went to a university I'd have to take out a loan (if even possible with my credit score). I'm planning on buying a house soon so that will probably drop my score even more. Not sure if that affects getting school loans at all. \n* I suck at math. Are there any CS degrees with less complex math or are they all kinda the same?

If I could I'd rather move to a different country every year.\n\nThe best time of my career was when travel was still allowed and I could travel to different cities within my company to help other teams there. There I could meet new people, talk with them to get to know what their problem was, go for drinks with them after work, and travel. I enjoyed this phase of my career the most!\n\nI'm still trying to figure out what I want from life, but I'm pretty sure if I keep doing what I'm doing I'll go crazy. Don't get me wrong, I love programming and there's a reason why I got into this field, but I can't sit in front of a computer for 8 hours a day without much social interaction. The best part of a day for me is when we have meetings, or when I get to pair-code with someone, or when we finally go for lunch where we talk with each other. As a sidenote, I also used to be a bartender during my high school years and I really liked the way there was always something to do, always some important issue to resolve, etc.\n\nTherefore, I guess my main question is, do you know of any role in this/any other industry where my software engineering skills would be useful while I could also do what I love doing the most: talking to people, working on different projects, and travelling?",

Usually SE2 are reserved for people who have about 3 years experience or if not then for people with their masters degree. \n\nSince i have my masters now and three years experience, is it worth asking my manager what other benefits i could get. Like i said i just got promoted to SE2 so i doubt theyll give me another promotion again. I also have to commit to them for another year since they helped pay for school, so i have even less leverage there as well.\n\nIs it worth asking for a raise or something similar?",

I'm confident in my Python skills and know that I can program pretty much anything the language allows me to if I can do a bit of research. \n\nBut then I go to look for requirements for entry-level software engineers. And programming in a single language is 1/10th of the requirements they're looking for. Most want you to be familiar with full-stack design. Comfortable in multiple languages. Familiar with both scripting and compiled languages. Proficient in databases. Networking. Familiar with a bunch of third-party tools that I've never heard of like WireShark or SoapUI.\n\nIt's so incredibly demotivating. It feels like I spent the last year and a half checking off ONE of TEN boxes that employers want in an entry-level employee. Is this normal? Should I be approaching it a different way? I'll be out of a job in January and was hoping to make the jump at that time. But it feels like I won't be ready for another ten years.",

        "body": "Hello, I come with an unusual question / scenario and was looking to get some advice or information from people who are in the field.\n\nI'm 23 and about to graduate with a CS degree and a 3.2 GPA from a decent university. I really like C# and .NET and have several webapps out there that I designed, built and deployed by myself(Including one that makes me a little $$!). I have a decent resume and would consider myself to be a proficient programmer who has enough full stack projects out there to let a potential employer know I'm a good candidate.\n\nI'll skip the pity stories because no one gives a shit, but I didn't have it easy growing up and often turned to trolling and being a piece of shit online for entertainment when I was a teen, it was the best form of attention I could get at the time. I used to bait people on reddit, twitter, and other social medias and say some dumbass shit, I loved the thrill of seeing just how many angry replies I could get and how angry people would get at me. This all took place when I was ages 15-18. \n\nI made the foolish mistake of trusting a good IRL friend of mine with this knowledge of my shit past and about 3 years ago we had a falling out and he doxxed me hard on social media. The logs and things that he posted weren't the most obscene things on this earth, but it did paint me as a very shitty, racist, ignorant person, even though I know for a fact that I never truly believed those things and was just memeing and trolling like an idiot.\n\nI could write for hours about all the things I lost because of it, but I don't want to bore everyone. I lost some old friends and my girlfriend had to disassociate herself with me for good, that one stung the most and still does to this moment.\n\nFast-forward to 3 years later, I've lost a lot of weight, been to therapy and can confidently say that I'm no longer that type of person at all, inside and out. I look back at those years with disgust. The original \"doxxing\" thread is now deleted. The comments on the thread are still there, and when you google my name, one of these comments comes up. It isn't a good look, but it's a lot better than before. I've tried many ways to see if the original doxx thread is archived anywhere but as far as I can tell it isn't (It definitely is somewhere out there, but it looks like it isn't traceable/ easily found)\n\nSo, as I begin to look for a start to my career, I wonder if it's even worth it to press forward, knowing that inevitably someone from HR or a team member or recruiter is gonna google my name and see those two comments labeling me as a piece of shit, It's only a comment or two, so there is a ton of plausible deniability with there being no concrete logs linking to my name. I can't have any social media anymore, as it would most likely just get harassed and to be honest I have no desire to maintain a social media presence at all, is this going to be a problem for your average company? Should I just own up to everything if ever asked? \n\nI'm sorry for writing this cringe, pathetic thread, and I'm sure that many reading this will say that I don't deserve to have a career of any sorts, and I can understand your position if this is the case. This is something that has consumed my life for several years now and has drove me to the brink of suicide and back several times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks",

Most of my projects are from classes that had a semester long deliverable and a senior year capstone project were we worked in a group with PMs and sponsors. The few personal projects that I have is a discord bot, a barebones path algorithm visualizer website, and a few web scraping applications for stocks and covid information. I didn't start applying to jobs till after I graduated (which is a mistake for sure) and I applied throughout the summer using LinkedIn and Indeed. Couple of friends gave me their referrals for companies in my area but never heard back from the company due to the lack of actual work experience, ie. internships/co-ops. I got demotivated from the job hunt in september and was getting anxiety from not hearing back from companies and family members lecturing every other day about not finding oppurtunities. The pandemic also made me demotivated from starting new projects and doing leetcode problems without getting even a phone call from companies made me demoralized. I started only applying to jobs every now and then. Fast forward to now, in the past month I started some online courses on udemy, cs50 from harvard, and freecodecamp to learn more about web dev. Put the things I learned and started working on more personal projects, started applying to 10+ companies a day but still not hearing from anyone. I need advice on whether I should hit up a bootcamp and try to network there, in hopes of landing a job or keep doing what I am doing right now. Another option would be going back to school for my masters. My asian parents have been pushing me to work at a family member's restaurant out of state and saying I should make money instead of sitting at home on the computer. My family is a traditional Chinese family, my parents are first gen immigrants and I feel like I'm a failure and on top of the weekly talks about what I'm doing with my life, where I explain that I'm trying to learn more skills, do more projects to put on resume. My life has been getting pretty toxic and depressed and I don't know what path to take and wanted some opinion on what I should do since it feels like I'm stuck on island.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Graduated last year as a CompSci major, have no internships and co-op, started applying after graduation and throughout the summer, never heard back from any company. Started to get demotivated after spending so much time on applications and doing leetcodes daily. Started to apply in staggered amounts spread throughout the months. Started applying 10+ applications a day this past month and picked up motivation to learn a new language in Javascript and did a few online classes and crash courses on web development. Getting pressure from parents to get a job (even though I am trying and applying every day) and feel so lost on what path I should take. Need some opinions on what I should do.",

I need to let off some steam because I have no idea how much of this is my fault or what I can really do to solve it, so maybe I can get your help on what to do at this point.\n\nThe problems began at the start, when the laptop they gave me made it impossible to run basic executables. The solution for that was to mail the laptop back for a replacement, which they only permitted me to do two months in. Then only when I got it back did I have to go on a business trip for another project for two more weeks, and by that point I forgot so much introductory information I was supposed to have remembered from onboarding. After that, I waited another two weeks for the helpdesk to download Node. I should also mention that I cannot download any software, I need to submit a ticket to the service desk and have them do it for me. This can take anywhere from days to weeks and they need to remote access my laptop to do the installation.\n\nThese delays compound with other issues (and my own mistakes) to bring me to today. I'm now four months into this project and still can't run a local instance.\n\nIt seems like the longer it goes on the more mistakes I make on my end. I can't concentrate on solving problems and I can't seem to remember anything. I try to keep notes but it's never enough, and our chat system wipes messages every day so I can never revisit old info. There's too many problems and I no longer expect things to get any better. It sucks to say but I really don't even care to get it working at this point; part of me wants to get fired.\n\nI'm seeking new employment, but worry that the bad habits and work ethic I developed here will carry over to the new company. Wondering if any of you have gone through the same situation and how you dealt with it. No need to call me a shitty developer, I already convinced myself.\n\nEDIT: I resolved the problems by getting a new job with 50% higher compensation. ",

        "body": "Hello, all. Long time lurker, first time poster.\n\nI wanted to ask you guys if it would be wise to include that I am attending college while trying to search for a $50k+ full-time web dev job. I feel like I would look too \"junior\", but then again, I am.\n\nA little background on me: I am 22 (started college at 18, left at 20, am now back at 22), currently attending university to obtain a bachelor's in IT, and finishing my second year at the moment. However, I need a full time job (don't we all).\n\nThe reason I am majoring in IT is because I am interested in that as well, I am CompTIA A+ and Network+ certified. But I want to work in web dev first, and then if I can't secure anything I would move to trying to find entry-level IT work. At the time of writing, I am working on my dev portfolio with a couple of projects in the pipeline using React.\n\nAnyways, enough background, my questions are, would potential employers disqualify me since I am majoring in something completely different? Would it make me seem too young to employ? Would it make me seem too \"busy\" since I am in college? Or would none of this matter if I showcase a great portfolio and have the right attitude?\n\nThanks in advance for the help. BTW I am a self-taught dev.",

        "title": "Do not blindly trust Bootcamps or sites that aggregate Bootcamp reviews/details when it comes to placement rates/student success stories. Stories inside.",
        "body": "Hello all!\n\nI am a Data Engineer who was able to make the jump from just your ordinary schmuck to someone that gets to write code every day for a decent wage.  I have a bit of a story to tell about my experience, and it might be a little on the long-side, TL;DR will be at the bottom of the post.  I will leave some bullet-points as well so that I can offer advice on what I would do different if I had a time machine and could start from scratch.\n\nNot too long ago, I had to close down my business that I was running, and I had enough cash on-hand to enroll into a Software Development bootcamp.  I will not disclose the bootcamp or my employer, this is purely a post to help out those of you who are at the stage where you are looking at where you may want to study.\n\nWhen it came to looking for a bootcamp, I really had no idea how to tell who was good and who wasn't.  All of my local options were priced in a similar range, and they all claimed a high (90%+) placement rate, with job-placement staff on-site to help you navigate the wild world of job hunting as a Jr. Dev.\n\nI ended up going with a \"cast a wide net with what you learn\" and \"learn at your own pace\" program.  What I found out was \"cast a wide net\" meant that I only got to learn a little bit of each technology we covered.  We went through HTML/CSS, SQL, Javascript, Python and C#/.NET in that order, with a heavy emphasis on .NET (and a little on .NET Core).  \"Learn at your own pace\" meant that we would be enrolling on online courses from places like Pluralsight and doing some skill checks and short coursework developed by their staff... of Jr Devs that ended up working there after they couldn't find a job in the field of their choice (this is confirmed by them to me, not speculation).\n\nWhat's that, you say?  You paid over 10 grand to enroll in online courses and take some coursework developed by people who have zero industry experience?  That's correct.  At this point I want to briefly stop and note that not all camps are like this, I think I maybe just picked the worst of the bunch.  Please don't be like me, ask questions before you enroll like \"who developed your coursework?\" and \"What kind of real-world experience does your staff have?\".\n\nOk, so that kind of sucked, but at least I was going to get help finding a job when this was all over... right?  Not so much.  Our job placement guy was a total disappointment.  While he helped us write our resumes (they all looked the same... more on that later) and did mock interviews, the actual job placement part of his job left a lot to be desired.  He never actually looked for any jobs for me or my peers, instead opting to send us links to meetups around town, which if you have been to them, aren't exactly job fairs (although the networking can be beneficial).\n\nWhen I actually did get some interviews (on my own, no thanks to my job-placement guy) I quickly learned that most companies do not want to hire folks like me with zero experience in the industry.  It is important to note that I went all-in on .NET, and was trying to get a job as a full-stack developer working with OOP (lol, I didn't even learn what an API was at the time as it was never taught to me or brought up in my coursework).  In one interview that I was able to secure, the interviewer asked me about my resume, specifically where/how it was written.  I let him know that it was written with the help of my camp's job placement guy and he flat-out told me that he had received roughly 25 applications from my peers and our resumes were exactly identical.  No idea why I got an interview and others didn't, maybe he was just curious.  I didn't get the job.\n\nIn the post title I also mentioned not to trust sites that promote \"hey go to this bootcamp!\" or \"here is a great story from Unclematttt about his experience with going from zero to hero!\".  This bit is what actually made me want to make this post.\n\nThere is a LinkedIn power-user (again, not going to disclose their name) who reached out to me and was chatting me up about his cool site that helped people just like me choose their bootcamp.  \"Hey Unclematttt, I see you went to XYZ Bootcamp- would you mind writing a review for my site and maybe doing a AMA for our users?\"  I proceeded to tell him my experience was bad, I am pretty sure the camps lie about placement numbers (at least half of my 'graduating' class never even made it into the tech industry), and the job I ultimately got was more of a support role that was at my wife's work.  I actually had to grind my way up to this position by working double-time and developing helpful scripts and applications in my free time.\n\nThe power-user's response?  Silence.  I followed up a couple of days later to ask what their thoughts were, and they never responded.  I guess it didn't really fit the narrative that they were trying to push.\n\nNow that I have shared my experience, I want to note a few things:\n\n* There *are* quality bootcamps out there, I just ended up at one of the shitty ones (do your research)\n* The job situation in my city (known as somewhat of a tech-hub in the region) might not be the same as your city\n* I could have done more to build out my portfolio before applying to jobs and possibly giving a bad first-impression (don't be like me)\n\nHere are some tips that I can share that I think might be helpful if you are just getting into the idea of picking out a school/bootcamp and want to be successful:\n\n* I sound like a broken record here, but DO YOUR RESEARCH on your bootcamp.  Don't put blind trust into what they are *selling* you.  They churn through students and their goal is to just get your money and get you into their program\n* If you are interested in full-stack development, take baby steps and learn everything you can about backend engineering first (what is/how to build an API, how do applications interact with databases, what are the hot SQL and NoSQL technologies in your area to learn, what are containers and how do they work, etc.).  Full-stack devs do not just sprout out of the ground IME, it can take years to become proficient with any given stack\n* What stacks are hot right now?  Are there lots of jobs for ELK?  What about MEAN?  Find something that you like and go nuts on it\n* Personalize your resume.  Start with what your camp/school helps you build, then do something (anything!) to make it different than your peers\n* IME there was more success with Javascript devs from my camp than anyone else.  Consider learning Javascript in detail and some of the more popular frameworks like ~~AngularJS~~ and Vue (I have been informed that Angular isn't hot anymore- I am not a JS dev, so my apologies on that, research what frameworks are popular in your area.  Edit: this is debated below in the comments, so again do research on what Frameworks are popular in your area.)\n* You will likely end up using databases in some way shape or form during your career, make sure you understand the ins-and-outs of various database technologies and how it applies to your stack/languages of choice\n* Develop a solid portfolio.  If you are doing front-end work, this is a lot easier as people like \"pretty pictures\" (my opinion).  Make daily commits on Github (many employers will ask for your Github profile to check it out before deciding to interview you).  Also have a basic-to-awesome portfolio website, and even though we all hate it, get a LinkedIn account.  Consider buying the premium version if you have the cash for it.\n* Try to find a language/stack that you are comfortable with and enjoy and go HARD on it.  Make sure before you make this decision that there are plenty of jobs that want those skills, there is fierce competition for Jr Dev roles, so you will need to apply to many of them (maybe even hundreds) before you land your first gig.\n* Make sure you are in a good place mentally before starting on this journey.  It can be soul-crushing at times, but there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel if you persevere\n\nI could write a whole lot more, but I think that this covers most of it.  Sorry for the long post, this is kind of therapeutic to write out.  Believe in yourself, but also take care of your future self by not making some of the mistakes I did along the way.  If I could do it, anyone can with the right amount of drive.\n\nTL;DR Make sure your bootcamp doesn't suck before enrolling.  Know the local market and what skills are sought-after.  Don't trust sites that paint a pretty picture, this whole process is a total grind.  Believe in yourself and put in the work.\n\nedit: Minor grammar fix.

I am studying a unique bachelors which is a combination of Maths, CS and Engineering. I also have financial literacy. So, I feel like I am suitable for this job. But I am not sure if I want that job. I will give details about the job advert: \n\n4th grade CS or Maths Bachelor's\n\nJoin Quantitative Trading Team as a long term intern\n\nDeep understanding of Probability Statistics ML\n\nProficiency in Python\n\nAbility to deal with open ended problems\n\nWorking on real projects with experienced traders, researchers, developers\n\nApply ML techniques to derive novel findings regarding market behaviour from large datasets\n\nMy questions\n\n1. So is this a research position or trader position? And what is the difference between a researcher, developer and trader?\n\n2. What is the work life balance in general comparing to software developer positions. More working hours? On call? \n\nAlso how common work from home, I heard it is rare because the company wouldn't want me to access my tech, data from home?\n\n3. If I work in this position for a few years can I get into Software development or Data science if I don't like it. Would those two years be considered as two years experience in Data science, Software development? Since I am close to 30 this is really important for me.\n\n4. Can I use the systems I developed in the team for my personal trades, investments?\n\n5. Is there any short online course, tutorial I can try to be able to understand what this job will be like? And also to gain some knowledge before interview.\n\n6. When I asked this in r/quant my post get removed and the mod messaged me a long post talking about how he quit his quant job and says I will quit too because this area is not beneficial to society and it will die after the big crash of today's financial system. There is no job security. What do you think?\n\nThanks.",

In my experience companies act as if they own you.\n\nI've been offered a new job with a globally renowned company in the UK and have been presented with a contract that intends to own all my IP/code. I've been on sabbatical and developed a lot of projects that are in full production.\n\nNaturally asked for a waiver for said pre-existing projects. The company is not interested in engaging in this process at all. Stated that if they were relevant to my role/the employer, then the IP would reside with them.\n\nWhy do companies act like they own programmers? Why should all my ideas belong to the employer? Why shouldn't I be allowed to continue with my pre-existing projects on my own dime/time?! Sure, anything I do concerning their business is 100% theirs. But to not even want to engage in discussion of side projects is just ridiculous. Especially given that the hiring manager loved the fact I had side projects during interviews?!\n\nHonestly, as a creative individual, I am thinking about leaving software and becoming a plumber. Pay outside London is poor, and what's the point in developing all these skills if I can't use them to benefit my life? I feel so trapped in this career. Am I the only one that feels this way? How do the rest of you deal with these issues? Do you refuse to sign? Or ignore such contracts and go ahead anyway?\n\nUPDATE: UK contracts often state that the company owns everything developed \"in the course of your employment\" (which is exactly the problem with the current contract that I've been presented with).

The fact that work is done outside normal working hours does not necessarily mean that the work is not done in the course of employment as, for many employees, there is often no clear demarcation of the hours of work.  \n>  \n>The key question to be asked is whether the work was the kind of work which the employee was employed to do i.e. whether it was within the scope of their employment. Could the employee have been ordered to do the work and would it have been a breach of contract for the employee to not do it? The terms of any contract of employment and job description will be relevant, however, these (and duties more generally) often evolve in the course of time and it may therefore not be appropriate to rely on them exclusively.\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] Russell-Cooke associate Emily MacDonald looks at intellectual property rights within the context of the employment contract (2020).

For example, the founder of the company takes every Monday off to spend time with his family. But we bust ass when things need to get done.\n\nI have lots of passions outside of work that I want to pursue while I'm young and strong! This company really likes the work I do and I enjoy working there.\n\nMy 6-month review is coming up soon and that's when I'd contemplate asking for a raise. At my stage in life and in my career, though, my time is more valuable to me. I am very much able to live my best life and save money on my current salary. I'd like to work one less full day a week. I sincerely believe as well, that this would barely impact my productivity.\n\nWhat are people's thoughts on asking for one weekday off as opposed to an increase in pay? (Working roughly 32 hrs) What strategy would you use? Will this be perceived negatively?",

Just recently I accepted a position as a Staff/ IT Auditor.\n\nEven more recently a recruiter reached out to me regrading an Application Analyst position.\n\nMy current position as an auditor can potentially lead to more complex IT auditing over time, but for now it's more reviewing screenshots of servers, reviewing a list of admin with access to said servers, and finding documentation and IT tickets to verify that they were previously approved to have access to these servers. Where as this Application Analyst position will give me IT experience since that is inheritably the job function.\n\nAs of now I have no interest in growing to a manger or director. But the idea of cyber security is intriguing as far as job growth in the next 5-10 years.\n\nSo my question is, should I stay with the Staff/ IT Auditing position which may eventually lead to more complex IT focused auditing, or change to Application Analyst and try to grow from there?\n\nAny advice is appreciated, it's been difficult to find an IT job where someone is willing to take a chance on me, and now that there seems to be two options I'm trying to figure out which path may be more beneficial to my career growth.",

It seems to be new and I don't know if this is something that happens with any sort of scam. i.e., sometimes in certain areas people make 'companies' over and over on platforms until their scam is caught but again just repeat that process and present themselves as a 'new' company. \n3. The insistence on that this is for a company that is looking to have the turnaround process of the interview in a very short time. It seems it is like the process feels perfect in regards to minimal interview(s).\n4. pay is extremely good.

They suddenly go from being a Masters + PhD in biology to a software engineer at FAANG within a year and in a way it frustrates me to know that these wealthy candidates only got into these top companies because they can afford to buy the resources, all the coursera courses they want, pay for a bootcamp, or CS MS, it's truthfully unfair.\n\nI know I shouldn't judge but I truly am passionate about CS and to see wealthy candidates with no passion for CS (otherwise why wouldn't it be their undergrad?) switching to Software Engineering at FAANG companies immediately within a year through different means (e.g. references, family, wealth, buying resources, etc) and get in without having to even study CS is simply unfair.\n\nHow do you guys feel about this?

        "body": "Hello everyone! I'm working on getting back into the workforce after a three-year gap. I figure I should lay out all the gory details so I can get the best advice possible.\n\nThree years ago, I was laid off from my last job, where I worked for a little over two years as a data engineer. Prior to that, I worked as a technical consultant for two years at one of the big software giants (name omitted for privacy reasons). Subsequent to my layoff, my then-husband and I moved to my current city so I could begin a master's degree program. We had a nasty divorce as I embarked on my studies, which were going reasonably well until everything went remote. Coupled with my depression (which is being treated), the stress of the divorce and online classes forced me into a leave of absence from my graduate program, to which I may decide not to return in favor of finding a full-time job.\n\nThis is where I need some help. It's been a long time since I appeared for a technical interview, though I do have experience conducting such interviews from my last job. I have several books I am using as preparation materials (Algorithms Illuminated by Roughgarden, Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, et al, CTCI, and EPI) and I am also trying my hand at some of the practice interview problems on CodeSignal. I have always struggled with these types of questions despite my four-year degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, and I am finding the preparation process rather overwhelming. Furthermore, I am worried about the large gap in my resume. I suppose my explanation is reasonable, but how can I convince prospective employers to take a chance on me?\n\nI feel very alone in this process, and it feels like the odds are stacked against me. Would I be better off just returning to my graduate program (my leave lasts until January)? How can I overcome this gap in my work history? I would also appreciate suggestions on effective strategies and helpful resources for brushing up on my skills and becoming more confident with technical questions.\n\nDMs are welcome.",

I know it might seem that it is a little bit late, but I suddenly realized that I don\u2019t want to study business and marketing anymore. Besides, it will be hard to find a job in this field. However, there are a lot of job opportunities for those who have a degree in computer sciences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI realized that the employment market is quite competitive at the moment, and it\u2019s hard to find a job with my degree. There is tough competition even for a place in an unpaid internship. I have no idea why did I choose this pathway. My parents don\u2019t have their own business, compared to some of my classmates. I think back in time, I applied for something that might be easier for me. Now, I feel like I\u2019ve wasted my time and money. Perhaps, I shouldn\u2019t have studied economics, and maybe I wouldn\u2019t have even noticed my epic mistake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see that my mates from my dorm, that study IT, already found some part-time jobs in their field, and they are just in their 2nd year of study. They\u2019ve learned everything at college, and now they can make some good money on what they\u2019ve learned. While I\u2019m struggling to find an unpaid internship with my degree, I will graduate with honors if I do good on my finals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I look for some jobs online, I see that almost every company requires an IT specialist and pays good money. While there are no offers for business and marketing graduates. I\u2019ve reached that point when everyone needs some work experience, but no one wants to hire me so I can get one. This situation became so ridiculous, so I even found a meme based on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the meantime, one of my friends sent me this link \u2014 [https://www.cardinaldigitalmarketing.com/services/seo/](https://www.cardinaldigitalmarketing.com/services/seo/) and told me that I can find myself doing SEO.

My goal is to build a career in software engineering, but having lived a broke student life for the past 4 years, I'm very tempted by the idea of having a salary as soon as possible. My alternative is living off savings for the next 3-4 months after graduating and applying for software jobs while practicing interviews and personal projects.

I'm here for perspective and curious how others are handling the shift to full remote offers.\n\nOffer:\n\nRemote with the occasional trip to HQ (once a month) -- I'm within driving distance so this is not expected to drag me through flights, etc.\n\nStartup\n\nBase pay > current\n\nCurrently no 401k match or bonus -- \"it's coming\" FWIW\n\n100% health coverage\n\nEquity\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExisting:\n\nSmall Design services team in large org COVID remote but very old school and continued pressure to return to office. By design services I mean other companies come to us to get it done.\n\nParent Org has recovered from COVID slowdown. Our division is beginning but I've spent \\~15 months stringing 10 hour weeks together if that.\n\nBase + Bonus + ESPP + 401k match\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRisk -\n\nObviously there is inherent risk in a startup. I feel there is a risk of layoff in my currently role, I'm surprised I'm still employed TBH, but I'm 1 of 1 for my discipline, so I think it's more about trying to attract work. It's hard to say, \"We can handle all your FW/HW needs\" when you don't have anyone to do it.\n\nVariable pay -\n\nCurrently I have a 20% Bonus target, of which I've never seen more than 2.6%, although I only worked through one Bonus cycle (COVID). I also have ESPP which has a minimum payout and due to COVID had banner returns, all in this could potentially makeup \\~$40k but expected to settle around \\~$15-20k as the world returns to normal.\n\nStartup has equity, if things go well this could return, but it is a hardware/services company. Historically, aside from Roku, we're not hearing that many Cinderella stories. Maybe see a 2x on the strike.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day, I want to work on cool stuff. With young kids, being remote during the pandemic has been a nightmare and a blessing. Being able to reduce daycare bills is a plus, being able to tend to other things at home and not need to fill all my free time away from work with mundane tasks is huge. I don't miss the people in the office, I'm the guy that typically wears noise cancelling all day to work. I compartmentalize well and treat work as work.\n\nI'm curious to hear how others are weighing their options as offices begin to push for return while remote work is simultaneously being flaunted in portions of tech.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nStartup with slightly higher base and full remote vs Public company with historical higher TC and office  demand. How much is full remote really worth?\n\nThoughts?",

I've been here for 1 year, and I'm actually finding my work very engaging, but there are just some issues I've noticed in this job for the past few months that make me feel like I can't work here anymore.\n\nThis discussion is not intended to be offensive, but I don't really know of a \"good\" way to describe my predicament.\n\nAlthough our site is based in the US, 80% of our employees are on visa from a certain southeast Asian country. Some of my American coworkers who were on track for promotion and exceeding expectations under American-born managment were suddenly let go when management randomly got rearranged recently to be a supermajority of people from said country. They were all terminated  within two weeks of the permutation for \"exceptionally poor performance\", and never were they asked to improve/put on PIP. No one who was from this southeast Asian country was let go, even though I'm aware of a few people who are certainly not pulling their own weight. (for example, there's a girl who's been here two years who's still under the trainee permissions group only)\n\nI'm currently under the last remaining American manager, but I'm receiving hints it's only a matter of time before I get moved to one of the other managers, and it's creating a silent sense of hostility that I'm not welcome here because I'm not \"one of them\". I'm not currently on PIP, but I think I only have about 3-4 months left here. I need some time to decompress, not worry about meeting my metrics, and start applying for new jobs, but I don't know how to do that. If I take PTO for a few days to do so, my metrics will fall. We're told that'll be taken into account in our 1-on-1 meetings if our performance suffers, but I feel like it'll just be turned around on me, saying I should be performing well enough that taking PTO shouldn't cause me to fail to meet my monthly goals.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n* Is my only option to just try the PTO route and hope management doesn't try singling me out for it?\n* With about one YOE, am I likely to be able to get out of here in 3-4 months, or do I need to take something else temporarily in the meantime, and try again later?

As someone will little to no experience, I was wondering what would be the most optimal use of my summer or if anyone could give me any recommendations on things I could do. The idea of internships was also thrown around but as someone with no experience, I doubt I will be a competitive applicant or benefit from such. I'm assuming internships wouldn't also be teaching me the fundamentals of coding, rather internships are meant to give me experience, but correct me if I'm wrong. I came across a couple of tech and web design internships but I doubt they would be helpful in the long run if I'm planning to pursue SWE. AS of now, I'm thinking about just learning coding through websites like codeacademy or watching lecture videos for CS61A. Is there a better use of my time professionally?",

On the other hand, people say it's a great place to work, is super chill, and pays really well. I'm still skeptical though since it has a rating of 3.3 on Blind and all the good reviews I found online are from 2016... \n\nSo yeah! If you could redo it over would you still work at Tinder? What's great about it, bad about it, etc etc. \n\nThank you ahead of time to anyone who does reply to this question.\n\n\\*\\* Bonus points if you're an iOS Engineer at Tinder!!  \\*\\*",

        "body": "Hi All,\n\nFirst post here, apologies if anything isn't in order.\n\nI wanted to get some input/opinions on my situation from all the good folks here, as I've been trying to make this switch for a while now. Here's my situation:\n\n\n- background/backstory (feel free to skip)\nI'm in my early thirties, have worked almost a decade in tech consulting (implementing/configuring SQL-based tools for things like sales management and accounting). In that time I worked mostly as an individual contributor, with a few years as lead consultant for some bigger projects (switched back to single contributor after a mini-burn out and deciding that being in meetings/writing email all day wasn't for me).\n\nI studied computer science in college back in Europe (about a decade ago) and am currently living and working in Toronto, Canada in consulting for a large organization (I actually quite like the company, I started here about 2 years ago, they have decent benefits/pay, though lately things have been changing slightly for the worse I find).\n\n- challenge/goal:\nI would want to switch to software development, my degree focused on this moreso, but due to circumstances and emigrating I kind of ended up in consulting. I'm finding it particularly challenging to find time/motivation to do side projects and coding after a full day at work (and I probably have some covid fatigue I think, measures downtown toronto have long been quite strict). In terms of prior coding experience: I got a Java certification a few years back and I have played around with  variety of language (Python, Java, C#, Cobol, Javascript etc.), but I find I'm lacking in recent and real world experience (as well as some of the supporting tools and technologies, things like Kubernetes or getting fully up to speed with AWS/Azure and microservice architecture).\n\nI've spent the last few years thinking about making the switch, but have always come up lacking on the execution and I REALLY want to change that. However, I also know that doing this as a side project after work every day is quite likely to fail. For this reason I was thinking of enrolling in one of the coding bootcamps available here, they're quite pricey but I think it might be the fastest/surest way for me to get into a dev role sooner rather than later, which will ultimately help with me develop the required skills further (I like/enjoy studying and learning as part of a job and think I'm quite good at it). My question is what would you do in my situation? Any specific suggestions/ideas or any glaring oversights/flaws that you see with my approach? Also: any experience (attending or hiring from) any of the specific coding bootcamps in Toronto is also most welcome!\n\nThanks all,\n\nR",

I've been programming since I was 18 but I finally decided to become a software developer at 24. I've gone through Unity (C#) and Flash (ActionScript 3) for videogames, and also C, Java, Smalltalk for the basics at uni, then Matlab and other misc languages for misc subjects.\n\nI got my first dev job as a Salesforce Dev at the start of 2020. I'm not a complete beginner, but I still feel that I'm behind regarding experience. My other friends are working on other languages and technologies (JS, React, Python, Node, you name it), and when I listen to what talk about it makes me feel that Apex is just a bubble that won't teach me much about the software development world. I want to learn more are get bigger challenges. But Salesforce is not providing that for me right now, and I don't know if that is because my current company sucks or because Salesforce is lacking things to teach me.\n\nMy goal these first years is to acquire as much experience and focus on expanding my knowledge. I don't care about the money or the job position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now I'm being offered two new positions: \n\n1) SSr. Salesforce Dev for a really good medium-sized company that is one of the best in the country. The talk with the dev leader was great and he sure knew a lot about Salesforce. He put emphasis on that they follow good practices and develop high quality code. I'll be working side by side with this person and I feel that I can learn a lot from him.\n\n2) Jr. Dev at an international company (offering Java, Python, and JS-related jobs mainly) that is growing a lot these last years and offers an HR product to the biggest companies in the world. The coding tasks they gave me to complete were the toughest I've ever been given for a job application. The interview with the leader was also great. He reviewed my code and did excellent corrections. It also made me remember that I've been out of touch with the most common practices in OOP. I have very good references for this company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now I don't know what to do. I do want to move to other techs, but that can be done whenever I want and I don't want to lose a good opportunity.\n\nShould I push a little bit further with Salesforce? Does Salesforce have much more to teach me?\n\nOr should I make the change now that I have the chance?",

        "title": "Which Language/Framework do people think there is the highest demand for and has the least saturated market?",
        "body": " \n\nI've been a .Net developer for many years and love the technology, but really dont like the majority of jobs I see for .Net. It seems like the market is quite saturated . Also , I'd say a majority of the .Net jobs these days are 50/50 .Net/Angular/React and Azure based DevOps .. There are a lot of demands for low pay and many employers tell me how saturated they are with qualified applicants for these low pay/high demand jobs. I know .Net is considered romantically appealing and so many want to learn it. It is what drove me to learn it in 2002. Although I was a VB6/ MFC programmer prior to it so got into .Net before it became as well known as today. However, I am starting to think this may not a good trait about .Net.. It has this romantic appeal and corporations that use it have unrealistic views about the framework and expectations of those who use it.\n\nDespite Java, for example, being an even larger framework, I have found many jobs in Java are much more focused on specific development needs and realistic demands. Rarely do I see a Java Spring job description that wants you also to be senior DevOps dev, like I do with many .Net jobs. Good luck ever finding a purely back-end .Net developer job, they are basically non-existent.\n\nI am interested in a framework/language that would be more lightweight, allow for more back-end focused development where I could become more specialized in one area of development.\u00a0 E.g. I hear a lot of DevOps people will do back-end dev with Golang and/or Python which is focused on helping to build and manage microservices.\u00a0 Having to spend a lot of time with React on top of that is pretty rough, but that is what I am seeing in many .Net jobs.  I feel if i am stuck working a full-stack type of job, I might as well just migrate towards Node and have a full-stack JS framework, rather than having to deal with complexities of two large frameworks.. Also, the demand for Azure DevOps is tough , since my background is mostly AWS and I would prefer a role that is more focus on one discipline (web dev vs DevOps) than having to be full-stack web dev/DevOps dev.",

        "title": "Struggling with giving myself a \"title\"",
        "body": "Hey, so I've been self-studying web development, and programming in general for a year and a half now. I haven't applied for jobs yet, because I'm currently doing my one year of mandatory army service, which is not the point, but I wanted to get that clear. However, I've had 2 employers contact me on LinkedIn to go for an interview, one as a Node.js developer and the other was as a Back-end developer. And this was probably a very needed confidence booster, although I've had to turn them down because of my army service.\n\nMy problem is, I have not focused on one tool. Throughout my studying process, I've only focused on getting the fundamentals right along with learning how to build things, no matter what the platform is, nor the tools used to build them.\n\nI've avoided using Angular, React.js, or any other specific framework or library, and stuck with working on all my web projects using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I even avoided using Bootstrap. I have also studied fundamental CS and programming subjects (such as the fundamentals in topics like OS's, Networking, Game Development, Hardware Design, etc.), learned the basics of other languages (C, C#, and Python), and built small things using them, for example, I worked on Linux for more than a year, tackled building a small game in C and did it, worked on small desktop apps using C# and .NET to be familiar with an actual OOP language and a different platform, got introduced to XML, and it gave me a solid ground to work with SVG in a web app I have been working on lately, I also worked on a small Flask project with a friend and helped them debug it and get it live. Note that I've tried to tinker around with all of this just because I want to be a programmer before being a Web developer, which is very important to me.\n\nBack to the Web, I've only been building personal projects, using Node.js for their back ends, along with vanilla JS on the front end. Although I see myself more fit to be a back-end developer, I don't think I know enough to title myself as a specialized \"back-end developer\" yet. I also haven't worked with any specific framework or tool on the front end and I'm not a designer, so I am not sure of that as well. However, I can implement complete designs using HTML and CSS. I have practiced this trying to remake templates I find on the internet by myself and finishing most of them, but I can't actually come up with design ideas myself.\n\nI know I'm ready and capable to get a job once I'm done with this year of service, but the problem is, I don't know what I can call myself or where I specialize in the Web. I'm sure I can build things, I can tackle any problems in a web app, learn the specific tools needed to solve them. I've been through these steps several times and I've completed the apps, but I don't know if this is enough for employers. I see a lot of jobs with specific titles such as \"React developer, Angular developer, etc.\" and I don't know. I'm currently building my portfolio, and I don't know what the title should be. Should I go with a \"Web developer\" or is it \"too general\"? Should I go with \"JavaScript developer\"? Or would it be thought of as me just open to using JavaScript? Thanks for reading through and I would really appreciate any advice!",

Usually when a task comes through, I need help understanding what is even needed to be done as there are no tech specs on the ticket, just a quick description. After having a talk with my \u201cmentor\u201d (a Sr dev) about the task I am then able to start working on it, and along the way will need help here and there when I get stuck on an issue. Overall, I thought I was progressing and felt good about where I was at. My boss had another talk with me saying that the project they assigned me to is a little \u201cover my head\u201d and to keep my busy is having me work on QA work. It\u2019s sort of unclear what this means for my job or what to expect but I\u2019m not sure what to do. Currently, I have zero stress about work because the QA work I do is manual testing and I am able to clock out and forget about work. Whereas before I would never feel like I\u2019m producing enough code and losing sleep over solutions and getting anxious thinking about having to reach out to ask for help when I\u2019m stuck. The company I work for really likes me and doesn\u2019t want me to leave but I\u2019m also torn on what to do about my career. Should I accept this mental break and get paid well to do a job that requires not much thought, but lose momentum in developing? Or do I fight for a development job or find a different company to work with and continue forth as a dev? It\u2019s hard to say what I want to do because I am so comfortable at having an easy job and enjoying this mental break so my motivation is low at this point.",

To be honest, my first few months here haven't been that great at all, but I'm burnt out on the job hunting thing and I want to get at least a year under my belt before I leave so it looks OK on the resume. For added context, the company has had a massive amount of voluntary turnover and the company basically has no culture at all.

It feels like she has forgotten a lot of fundamentals from not practicing. I think her stuborness to practice programming and work on projects shows that she has little passion in programming, which is totally ok, but she gets really mad whenever I bring that up, understandably so. \n\nObviously my friend has to make some adjustments to her attitude and expectations, but what do you guys recommend for someone who has a CS degree and little passion for programming.

        "body": "I'm kind of in a weird situation right now and am looking for some input.\n\nI'm a senior CS student and was lucky enough to land my first paid software engineering internship this summer (I've done 2 others but one was unpaid and one was cyber security). The company I'm working at is a large and has offices all over the U.S. but is headquartered local to me. The pay is relatively low ($15/hr) and the company is a not a tech company. I'm not quite sure what fulltime employees make but I believe it's in the range from $50-65k starting.\n\nMy issue is that my boss has repeatedly told me that he is hoping to extend my internship and potentially hire me full time after I graduate next fall (technically I'm graduating a semester early) if things go well. While I'm super excited and appreciate this, I can't help but wonder if I should be exploring other options.\n\nI'm worried that starting at a local non-tech company might hurt me down the road when I want to move on. I also know that FANNG-like companies are more open to new-grads than other demographics. I'm concerned that it might be a mistake to just take the first job offered to me (if it is even offered).\n\nThe thing is that I have a decent GPA (3.6) but go to a virtually unknown liberal arts college in upstate NY. It might be hard to get my foot in the door coming from a non-target school and one with such low name recognition. However, I have some solid internships and projects on my resume and have made connections with multiple people working at big N tech companies. Also this internship will help me get even more practical experience.\n\nI know it's early to ask this question but it has been on my mind a lot recently and I'm wondering how valid my concerns are. Would I be stupid not to take this job if it is offered? Would I be selling myself short if I did take it? I'm not really sure what to do here.",

        "body": "I've been working for this company for 2 years now. I was originally employed  to work remotely as they were a startup with a grand total of 1 other developer.\n\nAs the team grew, they got an office in a shared space (hated it, 1 hour commute there, 1 hour back) and I went there every day for about 3 months(?). Then Covid happened and back to remote I go.\n\nThey announced the return to office, a different office this time though. This one is closer (40 minutes by foot/bus). We are up to 8 employees now (not including the CEO/CFO), two of them work in **England**. Literally hundreds of miles away.\n\nI honestly can't fathom why they are saying I need to be in the office. I told him straight up (I have always been up front and honest, if not a bit blunt) that I can not afford the \u00a3120 in doggy day care per month.\n\nThe response was \"That's not my problem, these are the things you have to think about before getting pets\". I did think of them, I've been working and delivering projects on time remotely for 2/3rds of my employment here, why the fuck do I need to be in an office?!\n\nThis is a company that I've been putting in 100% into for the past 2 years, working extra hours, going the extra mile. My dog won't be a puppy forever (how the hell can people even afford to have kids?!), but with the tone I doubt a compromise will even be considered.\n\nI've even been rejected a pay rise this year, I am currently sitting on \u00a330k per year, about \u00a34k less than competing jobs and my peers of similar experience.\n\nOur office is in an industrial block. In the winter it's cold as shit, in the summer it's hot as shit, the bathrooms are awful, there is no where to really eat because the breakroom is tiny  and there is a fucking gym next door that blares awful 100bpm dance music all day and slams weights. It also costs me \u00a35 to get here. So in total, this move back to the office is going to cost me \u00a3140 more per month.\n\nI am fucking pissed and now have to go through the hassle of dealing with this confrontation next week and I honestly can't be arsed.\n\nI've always read here that \"*don't be loyal and give them everything, because they will take it al*l\" but felt it was different here, but it's not. It's the same.\n\nI'll never work outside of my hours again and I won't touch a single thing outside of my department.\n\nNot my problem\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes it's a rant, I need to get it out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I know this got an overall negative response, but I thought an update would be in order anyway.\n\nFirst off, thanks to the person(s) who recommended I read over my contract. It actually states that I am indeed fully remote with the possibility of going into the office *one per month* for a company meeting.\n\nI would also like to point out, like another Redditor here has. I am in the UK, we have rights and contracts when it comes to work. They can't just *change their mind* whenever they like. So I have a right to be upset, I put in the time and thought into getting a breed of dog that fits around my working hours and got him as a puppy **because** working remote was what was agreed at my time of employment.\n\nAlso to all the people that say \"dog doesn't need daycare\" or \"just leave them at home and get someone to pop in to take them for a walk\". Yeah guys, it's a puppy. They can't just be left alone for 7 hours a day with zero stimulation. There is a perfectly good reason why shelters have a ton of dogs aged between 1 and 2 years old.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "title": "Our director of technology is stepping out of his role and they want me to take over his responsibilities",
        "body": "Hey,\n\nI have been working at this small software company for about 2.5 years now as a full stack developer (first job after graduating with a CS degree). The company only has four employees and only two of us are developers (the current director of technology and me). It is still a young company so we are still very actively developing the product, which is a web application used by large businesses in their day to day operations.\n\nYesterday we had a meeting and it was announced that our director of technology is stepping away from his full time position to a more part time/consulting role where he'll only be putting in 10-20 hours a week. Later I was told by our main boss that he and the director of technology talked about how to go about this and the director of technology was adamant that I was capable of filling the role. He mentioned that he needs a few days to put together the numbers but then we'll talk about an increase in compensation since I'll be taking on more responsibilities. I'm not sure if my title would change or not.\n\nI am confident that I can do the job, but I am a little concerned that the compensation increase may not adequately reflect the responsibilities that I'm being given. I am currently being paid below market for the area especially considering I already had a ton of responsibilities, so I'm worried that the new compensation will only really get me up to where I probably should have been in the first place. I have also been in the process of interviewing with a different company in the last few weeks to try to get a better gauge on my market value but I'm still in that process so I haven't received an official offer from them yet to compare against, but from the looks of it I would be paid considerably more at that company.\n\nHow do I go about negotiating this if the salary my boss pitches to me is below my expectations? I only have 2.5 years of experience but at the same time they're asking me to fill a role of someone with 20+ years of experience. What is reasonable for me to ask for? Should it be more than a mid level developers salary?\n\nSome more info about the business:\n\nEven though its a young company that could still be considered a startup, I know that we're very stable financially and the last few months have been especially good to us. To my knowledge there are no immediate plans of hiring another person. So in theory with the director of technology taking a step back there should be plenty of funds to add to my compensation... Also for what its worth I really enjoy working here. Everyone is great and the culture is very relaxed.",

Is it possible to make serious money simply by being an exceptionally good programmer, or is it the case that you should focus more on business acumen and people skills after reaching a certain proficiency in programming?

Only 2 years out of school but web development and coding seems like a cool/rewarding career. Currently trying to find a role that affords a better work/life balance so I can teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my spare time. \n\nI understand that this will take 8-12 months with a full time job before I can reasonably make a pivot into web development. I\u2019ve started learning through FreeCodeCamp. \n\nI have a few questions:\n\nWill I be prepared for an entry level job in the industry after completing the courses through this program? \n\nDo I need a portfolio of side projects I\u2019ve done over these 12 months? \n\nWhat is a reasonable starting salary for entry level web development in NYC? (I know I\u2019ll probably be taking a decent pay cut here)\n\nHow long is a typical tenure at an entry level position before moving on if internal advancement isn\u2019t attainable?\n\nMy goal is to gain experience in an entry level / junior role and eventually become a full stack dev (starting with Python after html, css, and JavaScript). New to the industry and looking to learn. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

I'm sure that I want to work as a software engineer(not a data scientist) and I have opportunity to study cs and I'd like it but not as much as math and I really want to major in math instead of cs. And double major is not a choice in my uni(I don't live in US). Getting masters in cs after bachelors is a choice but it is very difficult to get a high gpa in math in my uni, on the contrary it is easy to get a high gpa in cs... \n\nThe rational choice here is to study cs, definitely, but really, how much do I need to choose the rational way to get what I want(having a stable and high-paying software engineering career)? \n\nI'm aware that wasn't a clear text but my thoughts aren't too :/ \n\nI'd like to hear your thoughts, please.",

        "body": "I appreciate this is a pretty broad question, but my search is pretty broad. I'm an embedded systems developer with ~5 years experience, and a pretty broad engineering and CS background. I think I'm pretty good at looking at things from a systemic level and considering technical factors which might affect them. A lot of work I've done is system integration rather than hyper-specific low-level dev (although that I've done too).\n\nHowever, I'm still struggling to see how to transition my career from being a developer to contributing to decisions on *what* gets developed given a problem. I've joined a very young startup a couple years ago specifically to address this, as I was promised an influence on the direction of the company. Of course this proved to be not the case. Yes, as the person leading development of our embedded product I have a good degree of control of how things are implemented, but I have no input into the conversations around \"how we as a company can help our customers given our product\". Any promise of that in the future always get trumped \"temporary\" business needs of me needing to churn out more product as code monkey doing what it's told. All that makes me feel like I should be more actively deciding on a career realignment instead of hoping it would happen organically. Because what I see ahead of myself is just getting more and more shoehorned into being a developer.\n\nHas any of you have made a jump from development to something with more higher-level problem solving?

        "title": "Career after cancer",
        "body": "Long story short, I am early thirty guy living in the Netherlands. Originally studied physics at Uni, even went on and did a phd because I was passionate about the topic. Left academia and has been working as a developer in the whole \"Data\"-business for the past 6 years. I don't like buzz words but titles have come and gone so much, but just to give an idea of I am doing I have been called things such as data engineer,data scientist, big data develeper and even machine learning engineer etc.... The past 4 years I have been working as an independent contractor (zzp), as I enjoy my freedom.\n\nUnless a fellow colleague in the Netherlands corrects me, the tech industry scene is not great there. So I have mostly worked in Brick and Mortar companies (telco, finance, retail, logitistics, fashion etc..). While covid19 obviously meant externals getting laid off, and I was no exception there, it became also a blessing for my career as a lot of companies are seeking contractors in other countries. This is were I got a taste of working at a tech company, tbh still surprised they were hiring contractors. There is a clear noticeable difference in mentality between tech and brick&mortar people. It was an amazing experience to have such talented and motivated colleagues. More on that later.\n\nSadly, things are never easy, I was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer a couple of months ago. Unsurprisingly, I had to let go of my current contracts to prioritize my treatment. \n\nI am about three quarter into the treatment process now. It has been not easy of course. You think you will be the exception, and that you will overcome the side effects, but they hit you like a truck.\n\nSomehow by miracle, I was able to negociate a contract with another tech to start towards the end of my treatment. In the period of my treatment, I was approached as well by two FANG companies for remote permanent. Out of curiosity, I followed the process with one of them and was even invited for online onsite interviews. As the side effects were intensifying, and I stopped the process.\n\nWork has always played a very central role to me. I am very passionate. Being able to improve and push myself to master my craft is very important to me. Cancer, however, is making me question a bit where I want to go with my career.\n\nAs I mentionned at the beginning, I worked mostly at Brick and Mortar. While I respect the people I have worked with, I do think B&M are the worst and most depressing places to work at as a developer. I often like to compare IT departments with Coat Hangers. Nice to have in the house, looks fancy and it's fun to display your coats (developers), but of course you rarely wear most of them (i.e. you can easily get away doing nothing for months and nobody will notice nor care). Everybody is different and , yes, some do enjoy the peaceful life of low pressure calm work. In my case, I have always needed action. I spend quite a lot of time initiating a lot of projects while working at these companies. It always felt I was a mule dragging a cart while 3-4 other people would pull in other directions. As you may guess already, I definitely was not the greatest friend with my managers. I do, however, take pride that I worked on some of the most innovative projects. I count myself lucky, despite the fights, that my managers's managers always saw me in high regard and always provided me with great recommendations which allowed me to keep moving forward.\n\nSince the cancer, however, and not being in my twenties anymore, I fear I will not have the energy anymore to fight similar battles. The though of working as contractor again at brick & mortar makes me almost as nauseous as my chemotherapy. I don't think I will always be able to work as an independent contractor with tech companies. Possibly, renouncing my freedom and  taking the opportunity to work as an employee at FANG (Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google) could be interesting, but looking at glassdoor it looks like I would be making less than I am making now (at least if I have a decent year with 10-11 month billeability).  My problem as well is that I am not really interested in working as a manager. I love working as an individual contributor. Bossing people around does not interest me. I want to refine my craft, keep innovating and building exciting stuff. This is one of the main reason I am   less interested in working as a employee. Being an employee feels like you are stuck in some cage where the only way to grow is climbing the ladder. I hate all the politics and petty backstabbing for silly meaningless titles. I take pride in what I create, not whatever non-sensical imaginary title or how many people are sucking up to me.\n\nHow would people want to move forward? Are there maybe some interesting companies and projects in the Netherlands I am not considering?",

My city is one of the most expensive in Portugal so I would expect a bit more, but that's fine I wanted to start working.\n* From the second day since I was hired they put me on tickets giving me deadlines of 1 day up to 4 days. I had to study the code base + all the tools I had never seen + some specific languages/frameworks they used without having the time to understand properly, especially with tickets with a 1 day deadline. I am an entry level, as much as I like learning new things it is impossible to learn in a good way and at the same time solve the ticket before the deadline. I am also afraid to make mistakes because of my lack of knowledge. For now I have respected the deadlines but I had to hurry a lot.\n* They don't explain anything, they just say \"this is the project, clone it and solve the tickets\". If I have a doubt they obviously are very busy so there has been a time where I waited for 4 hours for something that they then explained in 5 minutes (they could easily explain it in the beginning and I wouldn't have lost 4 hours of work esp with a deadline coming)\n* They put me on 4 projects in the first month, so I didn't have the time to become comfortable with 1 project because I got constantly switched to a new one\n* They are late in paying my first salary\n\nI am very stressed and I don't know what to do. They code really well and everyone is really competent at a technical level, so I feel like I would learn a lot, but at the same time they totally lacked an onboarding process that would have made me feel more comfortable and start in a confident way.

I'm a  software developer (Junior Mobile Dev - I do mainly iOS but from time to  time I help out in Android project in our company). In November it will  be 1 year since I become professional developer, before I had an  technical cloud support role and been customer service in some VR games  places. So I'm pretty happy with myself and my progress through the  years mainly because I was programming for only 4 years now (since I  started my first studies which I eventually left for my Bachelor of  Informatics degree). Now I'm ending my Bachelor Degree in month or two.  I'm thinking about applying for Master degree in Germany or in some  other country in EU (Netherlands are on my list too :D). I'm from Poland  BTW so it is somewhat a big deal for me while I have really no love for  my country right now and always wanted to see how it is to live in some  foreign country for longer time. But it came to my mind: Did I really  need this masters degree? My studies right now aren't so appealing to  me, I learn much more in my job etc. I have possibility to work remote,  so I could probably just travel and work. What would you do on my  position? Do you think that Master degree will help my in anyway or  maybe it just waste of time if I'm passionate about my work and learning  by myself. (While all I learned for job interviews etc I just did of  pure interest, and outside studies curriculum.)",

I have about 10 projects mostly written in Python on my Github (they are a bit hacky from what people have said but they do work for what they are intended), but I am trying to learn and program projects in Java more so lately. I also have been dabbling s bit with building some campaign software & a mobile app for political news from a particular political slant for Android ( I plan to publish them but I need to get approval for any outside activities). I also have hacked together a website in Wordpress for a friend's non-profit that is dedicated to criminal justice reform (I modified some of the PHP to show an article headline instead of just the title, made the mobile mode compatible with the main theme while still keeping the preview for the desktop enabled).

        "body": "Hi folks\n\nI've gone through a good chunk of r/personalfinance and r/cscareerquestions for insight and the answer to the post title definitely varies. I was hoping I could get some perspectives while I weigh the pros and cons of potentially leaving my current job which I am very comfortable in. \n\nI'm in the late stages of an interview process for a Solutions Engineering-type position at a large, high-profile tech company. While I do not like to count my eggs before they hatch, I've done this before and put off the planning/consideration until the offer finally came and ended up rushing on the negotiation piece. I've received great feedback throughout the interview process which makes me think that it's definitely appropriate to begin this kind of decision making\n\nTimeline:\n\n2019 - Got laid off from a job that paid 85k \n\n2019 - Found a job that paid 90k \n\n2019 - That job ended up not being a great fit at all, found a different job that paid 115k \n\n2020/2021 - Got a 5k raise to 120k\n\n2021 - Entertaining an opportunity that COULD pay 145-150k if I play my cards right per the feedback I've gotten from the interview process so far. Offer will more than likely start at around 135k per [h1binfo.info](https://h1binfo.info) (roughly a 12% increase)\n\nCurrent Job:\n\nPros: Great flexibility with time off and sick days, 30-minute max commute one way, absolutely wonderful coworkers, caring and empathetic management, great team culture, opportunity to learn a little about a whole lot of things (jack of all trades master of none), you are pushed to get 3rd party certifications, literally no micromanaging, respect work/life balance and do not expect work off-hours, and they do not fire people\n\nCons: Current role does not translate into a career unless you want to go into management for the department, locked into my current role within the company for two years (I'm about a year and a half in), you are pushed to get 3rd party certifications, little flexibility with working hours (day always has to end at 5 no matter how early I start), 50-70% customer-facing which I want to get away from, standing customer engagements which I also want to get away from, generally most of the expected tasks have become tedious/boring \n\nThis job that I'm at is probably tied for the best I've ever had and I've never had this kind of support from a Manager before - I had something of a nervous breakdown while dealing with some substance abuse issues a few months into quarantine. Without any hesitation, he gave me a whole week off and checked in on me to make sure that I was doing well. \n\nWith all of that said it is definitely a difficult choice for me to even consider leaving the company. However...\n\nWhat I know/been told about the new position:\n\nI will be part of a new department within the company so there is an opportunity to be at the start of something from the ground up (fast-paced start-up style type of growth), flexible working hours, will be about 20% customer work (no scheduled, standing customer meetings only working on tickets), 45-60 minute commute one way, could potentially offer a shuttle to the office (still WFH until further notice, probably until August)\n\nI'm at a point in my life where it would behoove me to make as much money as I can until the next big thing, which is moving out of the country and marrying my fiance. I'm going to a place where 50k USD translates to 200k locally which you can live on very comfortably for about 3-4 years so it would be great to max out the USD earnings. This company that I am applying to also has offices in that country as well. While there might be a possibility for a transfer, there are roles there that I would be qualified for if I had to reapply\n\nWith all that said if the current job I was at wasn't almost perfect, this wouldn't be a difficult decision. I've always followed the money throughout my career in tech and it's worked out well so far which is why I'm feeling like I should do the same here. I'm also considering having that big name on my resume as well. But this time is definitely different and I for sure am heavily considering how great management has treated me up to this point. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this and to get this far. Any and all insights are appreciated! Thank you in advance",

        "body": "I\u2019m soo glad that I finally got a job in tech that is paid and it is an internship. I have lurking this subreddit since 2018 and I cant believe my time has come!\n\nMy background is that I am graduate from a small college in Canada majoring in CS. I always believed that you needed coop to land internships but I was clearly wrong. I sent over 2000+ applications and went on approximately 50 interviews. In the end I ended up volunteering for a company as a software developer. My CTO saw that I was hard working and putting in 110% of my work and decided to offer a paid position in the company for the summer.  I will be working Software Engineer Intern( though ill be mostly doing QA work hehehe)\n\nMy advice, don\u2019t give up. Keep trying because when you give up you\u2019ve admitted defeat. Also if you can\u2019t get an internship or a FT job, work as a volunteer part time, you will make alot of connections and you gain alot of experience. If not you\u2019re into that then work on side projects, they helped alot in making my application look more appealing.\n\nMy plan for the future is to get into my masters hopefully , grind Leetcode and DS and Algo and hopefully get another internship or a FT role.\n\nGood luck everyone, you will definitely succeed.\n\nLink to my sad post, I made a few months back: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mnva5k/cant_find_a_job_sad_post/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

        "body": "Edit: I started off this post with the intention of asking one thing but it changed somewhere along the way into the entire situation Im in.\n\nI'm a 2020 grad who started his first job in September. My company made all the new grads undergo a couple of months of basic training of things like Python, SQL, AWS etc. I finally joined my team in mid-December and after a couple of weeks of getting permissions, setting stuff up etc, I started getting assigned work from Jan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts been five months now and I have not really done much - the majority of tasks assigned to me are of one of these types:\n\n1. Bugs which have been resolved in other versions of the product, where I basically have to replicate the changes made. A lot of these are assigned to me with the idea that I will be exposed to diff parts of the codebase and get more functional knowledge of the product\n2. Minor UI changes\n3. Writing of some selenium tests which are pretty basic and generally follow the same format\n4. Automation related tasks - run an automation suite, analyze whether all tests passed. If not, raise issues for the ones which failed\n\nTo be very honest, I have gone into auto pilot mode the last couple of months. With the pademic still going on and the monotony of wfh, my motivation was completely gone. Back in 2020, I was interning at a 'better' company but due to multiple reasons, one of them being covid, I did not get a full time offer. Recently I had seen folks with < 1 YOE applying to and getting into some top companies which I had deemed unlikely as I thought companies would not be willing to hire someone who is between the 0-1 year mark in experience. But on seeing this, I started leetcoding and stopped putting any effort into my actual job. I had started basically copying the code changes which I needed to replicate without even trying to analyze them, procrastinate on the other work as well.   \n\n\nI ended up giving a few OAs (Linkedin and a few good local product companies) and did not get through them. On getting some advice from some more experienced people, I am considering staying put until around July -August when I can pass off as a 1 YOE guy and then applying again, and continuing to improve at LC in that time. But now its starting to hit me that it will soon be close to a year without me having done any actual coding and Im not sure what I will say when asked in interviews about my experience. I wanted to get this sub's opinion on this situation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone been in this sort of situation where they were not getting any major work as a new grad and their coding skills suffered as a result?\n\nI am considering applying to other places and am doing leetcode prep on the side. One thing which worries me is what I would say when asked about my contributions at my first company. All I can really say is that I completed my tasks(without being proactive tbh) and delivered requirements on time. Would this be accepted? I see so many people who put on their resumes about what they designed or built etc etc\n\nHow do I bring this up with my manager? Should I be honest with him that I had kind of slacked off the past couple of months and not been making an active effort to learn the codebase(which is insanely vast and I still am not confident with).",

        "body": "So today I got a phone call with a verbal offer for the company I recently interviewed with. I was (am) very excited and l told them I accepted. I also mentioned I will be out of town the 13th through the 17th of this month. They said this was no problem since paperwork and a background check will likely take longer. I will be starting the 24th of this month.\n\nMy issue is that I forgot to mention that I have a two week vacation scheduled for July 20th - August 3rd. This has been planned since before I even interviewed and I haven't brought it up yet. I want to know if it's a good idea to email the recruiter about this? and how to best word it?\n\nThis job offer is more important than this vacation but I have spent some money I won't be able to get back most likely. So obviously I would cancel the vacation it if it's a problem. But is even asking about it going to get my offer revoked? Should I even risk asking? I will also be working remote for the time being I could maybe ask if I can do my work from my vacation destination? Any advice welcomed.\n\nThanks",

Obviously any source of income is a lot of work, but some may be easier to get lucky in.\n\nExamples that have interested me:\n\nE-commerce drop shipping site? Bug bounties? Mobile game development? New software that breaks into the market?

What kind of practice should I get outside school? Train interview questions, develop personal projects, go for some kind of certification? \n2. My main interest is a Data Center environment, but that's kind limited, as a plan B what field in CS will give me the most opportunities to as hands-on as possible? \n\nThanks",

I suspect my company will be leaning into cloud technology more so in the near future, so I want to be able to step up to the plate when this comes (obviously for more money and promotions and future jobs should I leave my company).  I'm thinking of starting with the certified Developer, certified DevOps, and then certified BigData. What are the thoughts on these? Thanks!",

I\u2019ve been working in the industry for about 2.5 years. \n\nToday, one of my PRs introduced a bug in prod affecting only a subset of users. I was able to deploy a hot fix quickly, and I\u2019ll be doing a post-mortem report. The unfortunate part is, last week another one of my PRs caused another minor issue (nothing broke, and it was related to some buried code that wasn\u2019t easily identifiable during development). \n\n\nI have my regular one on one with my manager in a few days. I\u2019m worried about his reaction to these incidents. Neither was particularly serious, and both were likely caused by my eagerness to get through my PRs before the sprint was over. \n\nHow do I handle this? I\u2019m making an effort to triple check everything before I merge in any more of my code. \n\nAside from these instances, I\u2019ve been a self-starter and made good progress on my tickets, getting acquainted with the business logic, etc. \n\nThanks.\n\n\nEdit: Autocorrected \u201cbug\u201d to \u201cbig\u201d in title \ud83d\ude12",
