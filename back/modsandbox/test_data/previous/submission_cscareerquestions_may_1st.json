Let's just say that I didn't take the traditional approach.\n\nMy portfolio starts off as being a CLI where users can enter certain commands. This is just a front, and entering a command will prompt them to switch to GUI mode because of some obscure error. Then the actual portfolio appears. Everything can be seen without scrolling as I have used a lot of GSAP to animate elements into/out of view.\n\nThe general approach I took to present what I've worked on is the following:  \n\\- Give a broad overview of the project.  \n\\- Talk about the most noteworthy stuff during the development period (I get rather technical here)  \n\\- Show some illustrations  \n\\- Rinse and repeat\n\nNow, two weeks into the development of my portfolio, I am feeling some self doubt and I am wondering if my approach is any good. What do you guys think? Should I just start from scratch and take the more traditional approach? Or maybe, as a recruiter, you're more likely to choose someone with a portfolio that stands out?",

However, I doubt those degrees will mean much in computer fields \ud83d\ude04. I am primarily working in health sciences-related chemistry (ie therapeutics) so it's not like my math is exceptionally strong\u2014 though I have taken multivar calc and linear algebra in college. After spending so many years in the lab, I realized that I don't really want to be a chemist for the rest of my life, and I'm not at all interested in staying in labwork. I also strongly dislike academic culture. And I much prefer to work at a computer.\n\n\nRight now I'm working through The Odin Project, which gears you up for webdev. I'm not that entirely interested in webdev as a career, but from what I read, it is easier to get a job in as self-taught. As a chemist, I enjoy brainstorming solutions and thinking about troubleshooting issues but I don't actually enjoy the physical labor of chemistry (I'm not interested in working with statistics so thats why I have ruled out cheminformatics and data science related to health sciences).\n\n\nSo,\u00a0 I think I would be into software engineering but the barriers of entry seem much higher. And I have been in school so long, IDK if I want to go back just for a CS degree lol.\u00a0I don't mind self learning at my own pace though. Or  online Master's are even worth it?  My plan is to finish The Odin Project (Ruby on Rails pathway), do some projects, then learn C/C++ and read a couple computer science books (like on DSA) but then what?\u00a0 How to translate webdev projects into software engineering skills and demonstrate competence to land a job in software engineering? Or should I be pursuing a junior web dev job (with focus on backend) after, to get experience\u00a0 and transition? Any thoughts appreciated",

After 4 months our company decided to make a ML team (which was being work on by contractors for the last 2 years). \n\nThe team was my self and Jack (fake name). I was a passionate new grad who worked in some ML before (mostly game related), jack was a phd candidate who specialized in the particular thing we were doing.\n\nAfter 1 month Jack put in his two weeks (but they let know go that day) because he got an offer at a bigger company. In my opinion he quit because there was way to many expectations from him for how much little time he had. I just felt that my boss didn\u2019t understand how ML development works.\n\nHe and I have been talking a lot (prior to him quitting) and we agreed that the code the contractors wrote were pretty bad and probably had to be rewritten. He also said this to the manager in his resignation letter (I got to see if because he sent all the work he was doing).\n\nI\u2019ve tried to lead the team by myself but the more I coded the more I realized that I needed to research more. After reading 20 or so research papers I now have a great understand of what worked for other people and techniques in which to build a better (more functioning) system.\n\nTomorrow my self and 2 of the managers are meeting to discuss the interview process for our potential new hire. I was going to take this time to address to them what they need to expect from this person and how to manage them. \n\nI\u2019m going to tell them that they may not see any improvements quickly, but that\u2019s what research is. As well as that we just need to scrap the project and rewrite the code base. It just sucks because they have no Ml experience so they don\u2019t know how much time things take.

The work is more project management based and hasn't really allowed me to delve into technical/analysis work which has led to me looking into software/tech as a potential career change. That being said my salary is above average for a graduate engineer, given the workload will become more intense as I progress.\n\nAfter enrolling and making progress on a beginner Python course from Udemy (which I've been really enjoying) I've been heavily considering my options on how to make this potential transition.\n\nI've dm'd a few individuals within this community regarding this, and have gotten excellent advice, but I would like to hear a more general consensus (if possible) regarding my situation.\n\nAt the moment I'm trying to spend my free-time both at work and at home to learn programming and any relevant skills.\n\nThe biggest concern I have is how and when I can make the transition into working within the tech space, with software dev more specifically.\n\nMy current plan is to do whatever I can on the side, and look out for any potential opportunities whilst continuing with this 2 year program for ATLEAST the next year.\n\nSome questions I have to the wider community more specifically:\n\nWill the next year be enough to learn programming, upskill and complete projects to a level enough for entry-level roles in the space?\nWould it be more important to go back to Uni and get a relevant comp sci degree (would be about 2 years given my free electives and such are eaten by my mech eng. courses) to help in my learning and garnering a formal qualification\nI've considered doing an online masters degree in something like data science or cyber security (which I can complete whilst working) but I'm not sure how relevant these could be for programming as a whole + it would require some prior knowledge I'd assume\nI do know that my current role will become more intense as I progress through the project lifecycle and become more involved with longer days/hours leaving less free-time for study which is why I'm considering a second degree.\n\nApart from that, any advice on potential next steps and how to move forward would really help solidifying my plan for the future.\n\nIf there's any more information I can provide please let me know.\n\nThanks everyone in advance.",

        "body": "I am a 22 year old who recently dropped out of college because being an accountant sounds god-awful to me. I started programming last year and racked up exactly 240 hours in JS and a little HTML & CSS before I stopped for my last semester of college. I spent 4-6 hours a day during last summer but now my parents are forcing me out and I'm working full time to support myself. Because of this, I can only find the energy to do about 2-3 hours of programming a day.\n\nMy plan was to continue working and programming for about 2-3 hours per day (which would give me a max of 711 more programming hours by the end of the year assuming the unlikely that I'll both never miss a day and always do 3 hours instead of 2). Then, by either January 2022 or August 2022, I'm focusing ENTIRELY on programming. I will take a work break offer from my job for about 3 or 4 months. \n\nMy question is this: \n\nShould I use that work break to just focus on self-study and finally getting around to building projects? Or should I use that time to go to code bootcamp? Or should I say forget the work break and just go to bootcamp part-time and do code part time?\n\nMy fear is that without a bootcamp education and without a CS degree, I will never be able to compete with those who went to bootcamp and definitely not with those with a CS degree. But I also fear that by going to bootcamp, I could potentially be just wasting $20,000 on stuff that it is possible to learn on my own. But it just doesn't feel as safe or as stable being self taught. \n\nPLEASE give me answers and encouragement!",

I then started to look into it and saw some people successfully got full time job after learning coding and going through code camp. I just started a HTML and CSS course and feel excited about this path.\n\nMy question is do you think this is a right path?

I'm not sure if this is a normal environment for an intern.\n\nI guess I'm having second thoughts about whether this would be worth it or just way too stress inducing. I could take an internship that pays half as much which seems a lot more relaxed with a modern tech stack and just following sprints throughout the summer. \n\nWould taking this internship and pushing myself way outside of my comfort zone be a bad idea?

        "title": "Need help in finding out the next steps of my career",
        "body": "Hi all, I'm in really need for advice, so I hope it's OK to post this here.\n\nI'm a back-end developer with 7 years in exp. I worked in several companies, mostly doing APIs and dealing with dbs. I have a bachelors in Software Engineering + business, so it's like a weird combination and it lacks some areas of a \"traditional\" CS degree. I have also experience with working with front-end, although my skills are not at the same level of back-end, but I can pretty much find my ways of doing stuff in Typescript/Angular. I also deal with \"Ops\" stuff, like CI builds, Docker/K8s/Helm, but again, not an expert. I can prepare images and all the like but I'm not a infrastructure/network/security expert.\n\nAnyway I'm currently in a job which the tech stack is modern and it's the only reason why I wake up everyday and go to work. The team is awful. Management is awful. It's this culture of blaming when things go wrong, no support and I'd even go and say a bit of 'tech bros' culture. Another thing that is bothering me is I get these huge tasks, not even a high level specification, just a \"wish\" of what they want. I try to make meetings, to find out what is it that they want, most of the time the meeting gets hijacked by one of them (the tech bros) arguing about something that we'll not need in 10 years. Then  I have to work my ass off to do things, then when I present my ideas or what I came up with they say oh but that's not it, or let's change this.. so the task that should be 2 weeks becomes months, just bcs I have no way to know what they want. Make no mistake, I don't work 2 weeks without talking about it, I post on our chats, i create documentation, diagram. But nobody seem to care and they only care later on. Frustrates the hell out of me.\n\nSo this has been going for over 2 years now. Recently I decided to start looking around for jobs and I found out this one which looks very interesting but it's completely out of my comfort zone. The tech stack is different from the ones I work with, and not only that, it's a different domain, I'll be developing let's say tools for other devs.  I already had an interview with them and will be having a second one, so I guess they liked me. It was very technical, about the tech stack I work now, and there was some other general questions. I liked the interviewer, it was fair and felt more like a good conversation.\n\nSo, now I'm wondering what should I do. I'm kinda getting scared of jumping and then finding out it was too much to handle. I stalked some ppl there and they all seem super smart and working with like 3, 4 different languages, doing all sort of different things and I'm here like: Why they are even considering me? I only know 1 language \"well\" + front-end but not that deep.\n\nI kinda understand that if they decide to offer me the job, it's because they believe in my skills and my past track tells that given challenges and new things I have always overcome them. I'm excited about it and I think it will be great for me as a professional to broaden my skills but the imposter in me is telling me that this is TO much and I'm panicking a bit :).\n\nSo I guess what I'm after with this post is: What you think about moving to a job where you don't have much exp with the tech stack? What things could I ask during the interview to assess if they are really aware of the fact that I lack knowledge and also if I will be given the time/support to ramp up and become a productive member of the team? I'm aware of my fears and the shitty imposter syndrome holding me, but I'm afraid of jumping in, then been given tasks where I have no idea what to do and then not get support, specially now with Covid and prob not meeting the team IRL for some months. In the other hand it's not like it's raining cool jobs, so I'm also worried of moving then being fired or not liking it, and have lost what I have today. I have my savings and would be ok without a job for months but I would prefer not to be in that situation.\n\nSorry for the long post and thanks in advance :)",

My dad makes six dollars less than me with fifteen years of experience (we live in NYC so that is really not enough to live off alone haha). So I dunno man.

This will be my fourth technical internship on top of other extracurriculars and hardships I faced (my grandfather died from COVID. also, poor grades lol), so I'm very happy, but do feel a twinge of \"something.\"\n\nI think I just want to give back to my family honestly. They're not bad people (well, my mom treats my dad as a ranting bag thoe). Only thing is that my dad is extremely tired and overworked for what he's paid, and both my parents don't clean up after themselves. Security guard work isn't necessarily hard but during the pandemic, my dad would say things like, \"If we die, we die,\" which implies that he doesn't think much of his life. Not sure what to really think or if I can even help him change that.\n\nPoint is, coming from a low income family to having pretty decent wages is like, mind blowing. I have such a hard time spending money because I'm used to not having much haha.\n\nEdit: The question is poorly written.

This pops up on a lot of job reqs, and it's on my todo list to get a basic REST API up and running to cut my teeth on it. \n* I've never written anything \"For production.\" Even work software doesn't extend outside of my team.\n\nEffectively, I see my pitch as being: \"Yes, I'm not from a software background, but I have 5+ years of experience delivering products in a high tech field with many parallels, a track record of learning and adapting to new situations quickly,  as well as professional & personal programming experience.\" Does this seem like a fair pitch or am I way off base?

I don\u2019t expect to be making 100k right off the bat, but I don\u2019t want to be making so little I can barely get by but I think that\u2019s everyone\u2019s way of thinking. \n\nSo the main point of my post is:\n\nIs it still possible to have job opportunities up in NYC? And what steps can I take now to give myself a better chance of getting a job up there? I\u2019m gonna be a college freshman in a few months.\n\nThank you",

        "body": "I have a question about executive roles in big tech companies.\n\nAs long as I have worked for them and followed them they always seem like they lack creative juices.\n\nThese execs are always in such a position of privilege and rarely do they ever seem to improve the products they govern. I'm not arguing that engineers would be better at coming up with product ideas and the general direction, but I do think that some people are naturally good at ideas and strategies.\n\nWhich is weird because these types of personalities are generally the engineers at a company. And the execs tend to be more like salesmen or managers grandfathered into their high status role.\n\nIdeas people should be execs. Not managerial people. These are two very different types of people. One type is good at managing others, details, facts, schedules. The other is good at big picture, creative, potentially a bit disorganized, and abstract thinkers.\n\nYet every exec I talked to so far is just a glorified manager. And their ideas are (no offense) usually pretty bad. I've seen great products get shafted by terrible ideas piled on top of it by people who have no understanding of what a good idea or bad idea looks like. And you can see this in almost every big tech company.\n\nWant a great example? Activision Blizzard. It's clear the higher ups are not interested in making good games or they don't understand game systems. They are so out of touch with the product that it just seems like the perfect example of this. It happens on a smaller scale at every tech company. And it makes me wonder why these people even need to exist. These execs remind me of DeeDee from Dexter's lab. They just run in and start pressing buttons and turning jobs and making noise hoping that they do something good and can take all the credit for it.",

For example: Python wrappers around APIs/databases and machine learning tools.\n* I am able to work in and understand a \"cloud environment\": K8s on AWS, Artifactory, Docker, Spark\n* Good background in machine learning (math major, 2 medals in Kaggle competitions).\n* I would say \"good\" understanding of computer science fundamentals: data structures & algorithms and using these correctly in Python.\n* Some Java understanding (3 courses from college).\n\nMy goals are pretty basic and probably common:\n\n* Land a job in Seattle.\n* Work with many other engineers in order to build a strong professional network.\n* Work as part of a larger system/software-base (basically have my work intertwined with other SD's work. Most of the stuff I build now is stand-alone).\n\nSo now I'm wondering what sort of positions I should be applying for. I think I would be a good fit as a SD on a ML-engineering team, but these positions are scarce and seem to want people with more experience. That said, I'm definitely not set on staying in data analytics -- I think it would be great to learn new technologies as I can see myself working on a research/start-up team in the future.\n  \n  \nAnyways, what do you all think? What sort of positions should I be applying for? Can you recommend any services that will help me land a job?\n\nThank you!",

I'm debating between graduating just with bachelor's or pursuing a master's in NLP/Human Language Technology (would only take me extra two semesters). I'm **mainly interested in NLP, Text Mining and recommendation systems** (haven't taken speech processing yet). My school is huge (top 3-5) in the NLP realm, and this is important not because of the rankings but because of the support and opportunities I'll have access to during my masters. If I graduate just with a bachelor's, then I'm considering an SWE role at big techs. If I end up doing a master's, then an applied ML position (MLE, NLP engineer, etc) at big techs.\n\nI have taken some courses related to NLP/DL; I enjoyed them, but at the moment I'm not sure if I liked it enough to do a master's in it and potentially commit my career path to it. Job prospects and competitiveness of getting such positions at big techs would factor a lot in my decision.\n\nI'm wondering **how competitive** it is to get an MLE/NLP engineer positions at big tech firms like FAANg, Linkedin, etc. What would the **expectations/requirements** be for MLE/NLP positions (ML- and NLP-related knowledge, research/internship experience, personal projects, publication, Leetcode, etc)? Also, what would an engineer at such positions work on on a regular day? In your opinion, what are the pros and cons of each role (MLE/NLP engineer vs. general SWE)? What would be the kinds of advantages an MLE/NLP engineer would have over general SWEs?\n\nThank you!",

I feel like my brain is fried - both from having to _pretend_ to work for a large part of the past 8 hours (which I'm sure many people working corporate can relate to - though now working at a smaller company, I feel like the problem remains largely the same), and from the lack of fresh air and/or human interaction during that time (I'm an outgoing person and I crave human interactions but at my previous jobs, the interaction was literally three sentences exchanged at the watercooler a day; now at this new job, it's the same thing - the guys I'm seated with in the room literally don't say _a word_ apart from \"Hi\" and \"Bye\" the whole 8 hours - and believe me I've tried to have them talking but having felt like I was conducting an interview again and again, I just stopped pushing). Also, I'm so appalled by any digital media after sitting 8hrs in front of a screen that the things I would normally do to unwind (watch YouTube, watch a movie, play games) are completely off the table as my eyes are dead and I can't even focus on those things. I feel both physically and mentally done and it takes me a good two hours to be able to do any focused, quality activity for the remaining two. \n\nIn my previous jobs, this escalated so much that I'd gained like 15kgs over my year of working there, neglected basically all my hobbies and hated every hour of my life both on the week days (because of having no quality time outside of work) and on the weekends (because I wanted to cram so many things that I wasn't able to do during the week over those 48hrs that I was constantly stressed and frustrated that I could not). I did learn some lessons from that job and applied them now (like preparing meals in advance, forcing myself to sleep right etc) but honestly, the effect of those seems pretty negligible in the big picture.\n\nSo now I feel like I'm starting to fall into the same cycle again and I don't want to allow it to spiral as much as the last time. How do people still have a life while working full time? Having hobbies, friends and relationships, running freaking marathons? I do have all those things but am never able to sustain them when working full time. Even now I can see that my running schedule starts to fall apart again, I'm playing instruments 1 day a week instead of the usual 6 and so on. Despite rigorously sleeping 7h+ nights now, still the thing I'd love to do the most is just go and have a nap (which I'm forcing myself not to as it disregulates night sleep afterwards when done that late in the day). Is it the nature of working in CS and if you're not temperamentally compatible with being silent and alone for 95% of the day then you're not going to fit in? What am I doing wrong? Do you have any tips, personal accounts?",

I've recently (last 5-6 months) gained a significant interest in programming which began with a intro to data science course I took last fall. I am currently in school for a bachelors in Psych with a minor in Computer science.  I feel like that might not be enough especially since applying for software engineering internships has been rough to say the least. \n\nShould I consider applying for a masters in csc or data science? Im not too keen on working in the data science field due to many subreddits stating that many data science jobs today are not at all like the cool stuff you learn in school, also that many of these \"data science\" jobs are really more like data analytics and things of that sort. Machine Learning does seem very interesting but I am not sure if that field is dealing with the same things I have read online with data science. Can ML engineer be a similar work environment/field as a software engineer (assuming you work at similar tech companies). Idk much all I know is that I feel more challenged and more satisfied when I work on my csc projects. I'm also taking an aws cloud technical essentials course on coursera so maybe I could work with that to start my career and then transition into software engineering? \n\nAny and all helpful input/information is gladly accepted.",

Her college is unknown to pretty much everybody in the U.S.\n3. She doesn't have any full time work experience in the U.S. as a programmer at a well known company.\n4. She is here on a long-term green card (she sometimes puts this on her resume).\n5. COVID impacting hiring.\n\nIs there anything she can do to improve her odds of finding a full-time web development job in the U.S?\n\nMy only advice:\n\n1. Get her resume professionally written.\n2. Get a masters in computer science from a well known U.S. university.\n\nI would love to hear experiences from other immigrants who might be in her shoes and if/how they have overcome it.\n\nThank you.",

        "title": "Are my expectations as a future software engineer too much?",
        "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently a first year college student attending a pretty good Jesuit University in the north east of the US and I'm majoring in Computer Science. I intend on doing an accelerated program where I get my bachelors degree in computer science and masters degree in software engineering within 5 years. My bachelors tuition is practically completely covered with a full tuition scholarship, I am a commuter so I do not pay room and board, and my masters will hopefully be covered with a graduate assistantship of some sort. Therefore, I will likely be debt free by the end of my education.\n\nThat puts me in a great position of not being in any debt out of college with a bachelors and masters, as I also have fully financed a car that will hopefully last me the next 8-10 years. Therefore, the next step would be to move out of my parents' home and find somewhere to live. For years, my dream has actually been to live \"up in the sky\" in a highrise in a beautiful city, and many of the top tech cities in the country are ludicrously expensive to the point that software engineers may not be able to afford to live in them. Something that has been heavily weighing on my mind is the fact that I ultimately hope to move to Miami, Florida, in a high-rise condo (not apartment) ranging from $2000-$3000 per month, but from my research, it appears as if Miami is not a big tech city and the engineers/developers do not get paid as much as engineers in, say, the west coast. I'm at a loss because living in the west coast in a highrise in a city is nearly double or triple the cost of doing the same on the east coast, but the salaries are much higher over there. I'm unsure if this dream is unrealistic in my 20's, but I want to do anything I can to set myself up to make it happen. I've lived in a crammed house my entire life, and the idea of living in a cozy condo with beautiful views is peaceful to me. Additionally, I am in a relatively long-term relationship, and my girlfriend is on-board with the plan and going to school for registered nursing, however I am unsure if it would be wise to finance the condo together rather than pay for it myself. Any advice would be appreciated on anything!",

        "body": "I'm a Senior Software Engineer (just got the promotion) at a startup (2 years 8 months exp). We're a development team (6 members and expanding now) in Asia working on a Swedish project. I joined the company on August last year.  \nMy salary was ok but I got an offer from another company and I let know my CEO. Then he offered me more (almost twice as which I was getting at the company) and promoted me to Senior. Even before that both CEO and Team-Lead have mentioned to me that I'm exceeding their expectations and they're very happy about my performance. But I thought it was just something to keep me happy and keep tied to the company without any pay raise. But apparently, it wasn't.  \nAfter the promotion Team Lead contacted me and mentioned that I'm performing well and I can be his right-hand man hereafter and said that he'll assign some advanced stuff to me which he was working on but now he doesn't have much time to work on since the team is expanding. I was surprised since there's already another Senior (at least 2 years more exp than me) who has joined the company way before I joined. But anyway I felt so good he choose me over other seniors.   \nWhat worries me is the company is very flexible. We just have to complete 40 hours per week and for more hours we're getting OT. But now considering the pay (which is now way above the market) I don't need to work OT. But I'm not sure how to proceed with the new responsibilities. Any advice, tips would be greatly appreciated.  \n\n\n  \n**TLDR** : *Promoted to Senior Software Engineer and chosen as the right-hand man of the Team Lead, over 2 devs who joined the company way before me and have more experience. How can I impress the boss and do good for the promotion?*",

        "body": "Hi all,\n\nSo I am in a strange situation. I got accepted to go to PT school about a month ago and was supposed to start in the fall of this year. However, my national guard unit got surprised with a deployment that's going to be from Oct 2021 to around September of 2022. This means I won't be able to start PT school until Jan of 2023.  I will be honest and say it does have me down in the dumps since I applied specifically after being told this deployment wouldn't happen but now it is. \n\nNow since I will be spending a year in Kuwait doing basically nothing (and will have internet access most likely) I have been looking at what I can do to not make that year a waste of time. Looking at CS vs PT I noticed how much more upward mobility and flexibility there is in the CS career field compared to PT. Also not to mention not having to go to PT school for 3 years which means no income at all and maybe some debt even with the military paying for schooling. \n\nI have always liked computers and have built many systems, but I have zero experience with code. If I applied myself over the course of a year would I be able to become proficient enough in the an area of CS to possibly switch career fields and work my way up from an entry level position in the future? If so what path should I take to go from learning to applying what I learned to looking for a job? And of course is it even a good idea to think about changing careers when I have an acceptance letter in hand to PT?\n\nAny input is appreciated. Thanks everyone",

I\u2019m kinda leaning towards not considering any unpaid internships, but I was curious to hear someone\u2019s thoughts on it.",

I'm currently on an internship and in my 3rd year of a BSc in Computer Science, and will be heading into final year shortly. I have a years industry experience writing software professionally, and would like to have some sort of job related to development when I am studying for my final year to make some extra money on the side.

        "body": "Hi, I am a 2nd-year undergraduate student. I have to choose my major 2 or 3 months later.\n\nIn advance, sorry for not sufficient knowledge on technical domains and the Reddit platform. This is my first post on it.\n\nMy interest includes robotics algorithms (mapping, localization, motion planning, and so on), computer vision, machine learning, low-level programming, autonomous driving systems. I would like to work in the robotics industry as a software engineer or research engineer. To get job opportunities in these competitive areas, I plan to get a Master's degree or Ph.D. in a related area. I recently have got an internship (almost equals to a part-time job) as a computer vision engineer, which attracts me so much. So, I am eager to get deeper into these areas.\n\nBecause of my broad interest and probably vague understanding of these domains, however, I have trouble with deciding whether I will major in Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science.\n\nThe same kinds of questions are already posted, but courses of CS and ME are a little bit different from ones in general. For your better understanding of my situation, I give a brief explanation about departments in my university.\n\nThe department of Mechanical Engineering in the university where I learn provides so many courses about mechanics (heat, fluid, material, mechanisms), control (classical & modern), and mechanical designs based on CAD, but not enough ones about robotics software, especially about the algorithm area. In lab classes, they deal with more heat systems like engines, less intelligent robots, deep learning, or software (not zero).\n\nThe department of Computer Science provides a deep understanding of computer systems, algorithms, low-level programming, machine learning, compiler, and logic. Especially, since I like low-level programming and computer system, these kinds of classes strongly attract me. However, they learn nothing about engineering concepts such as control, signal processing, and robotics algorithms. In addition, they learn mathematics from so theoretical point of view, which does not seem to fit me. I like math, especially optimization and geometry, but classes like \"definition -> proof -> definition -> proof -> ...\" are boring for me. Historically, CS in my university derived from Math and belongs to the School of Science, not to the School of Engineering, so it is natural that professors studying pure discrete mathematics and pure logic in CS. In my view, though a CS degree is said to be good for jobs related to software, it is not necessarily true for robotics software.\n\nIn summary, it is a problem like \"Hardware side with so much mechanics and design or Software side with computer systems and a little bit too theoretical mathematics\".\n\nI hope to get some advice from those who are related to the robotics industry or academia.\n\nThanks for reading and answering, in advance.",

        "body": "I worked at my last company for 5 years or so. It was one of those Kool-Aid drinking places where everyone is \"family\" and all that nonsense. During that time I had a bunch of managers, but my last one hated me from the get-go for some reason and my life a living hell. Right before the pandemic he called me all sorts of names, I went to his skip level, huge mess. I was ready to get out, and then the pandemic hit and suddenly jobs were hard to come by.\n\nThen with the pandemic the company laid off 1/2 of their staff and it ruined what was left of the culture. Nobody trusted each other, everyone talked shit behind everyone's back, micromanagement, people constantly getting yelled at, coworkers that were friends turning on each other. It basically got to the point where I opened my laptop and wondered \"how am I going to get yelled at today?\"\n\nLong story short, I left that nightmare and started a new remote job. People from my old job are stalking my LinkedIn. I even had someone who still works there who I once considered a friend email me, tell me my boss talked shit on me for over 2 years in 1 on 1's (and still does), and that I was replaced by my boss's friend. I don't need old gossip in my life (and not sure what the point is to even rub my nose in this shit), so needless to say we don't speak anymore.\n\nSo long story short, after years of emotional abuse in the workplace I am having a bit of a hard time trusting my new coworkers. I keep waiting for my new boss to jump down my throat, or my coworkers to gossip about me, even though there's no inclination that either will happen. After years of passive aggressive code reviews, I'm trying not to project that tone on new people, but I can't help it. \n\nOther than good old therapy, do you have any work-place related tips on how to mentally \"start fresh\" with a new group of people? Has anyone else had a similar experience?",

        "title": "Really need advice on whether or not to change jobs (really really LONG story)",
        "body": "Warning: Long Wall(s) of text\n\nI'll start by describing where I am now: I have 5 years experience. I have agreed via email to take a new job and have been sent the final contract to sign. I was sent the final contract yesterday. I have not signed it.\n\nNow, for a lot of background: Last September I was in the interview process with this same company. It is quite a big company, probably top 5 in my country (Asian). I initially reached out to them to apply. I got the offer, however, I turned them down because the salary increase wasn't really that much for jumping jobs, about a 20% increase. I do like my current job (100% WFH, this new one is not) so it wasn't worth it.\n\nSoon after I turned them down, my project at my current job ended due to unforeseen reasons. So in December I reached out to them and asked if the role was still available, they said no, but they will let me know next spring if/when they have openings. So they did. I got an email in March. By  this time I still didn't actually have a project at work, basically having done nothing for 5 months. So I said yes. I tried to negotiate a few things with them but they would not budge on anything--no extra vacation days, not a single extra dollar in salary. Nothing. But whatever, I really wanted this job. I went through 1 more in-person interview with them. They did wonder why I was interested in the job again since I initially turned them down and I just told them the truth.\n\nThings took some time, and I finally agreed to the official offer letter in mid April. \\*\\*2 big differences\\*\\* comparing this offer and the one from last year--this is a 2 year contract offer, and last year's was permanent employment. This one also gives me a 28% raise compared to 20% last time. I wasn't thrilled about just a 2 yr contract, but well whatever.\n\n Then holy shit, literally the day I was set to tell my current job that I will be leaving at the end of May--I got a raise. Out of nowhere. I never asked for it or hinted to anyone. A 25% raise. When I got the initial email from my director, I thought I was getting fired. Now the 2 salaries are nearly identical--just a 3% difference between them. I did not tell the new job though, because I didn't want them to feel like I was stringing them along, especially since I turned down their offer last year. Then \\*after\\* that, \\*I\\* reached back out to them. So I said to myself, \"ok fine. You really have to just accept this. Very bad timing, but that's life. Stay true to your word, you accepted so it's the right thing to do.\" So I told my current job I will be resigning at the end of May, and I refused their raise. Now our 2 companies HRs are talking to get all visa stuff worked out for visa transfer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo then yesterday I finally got the final contract. And there are some things that are different, or were not included in the initial offer. For example, there is no mention of my bonus. Also the contract states that employees are not allowed to discuss salaries with anyone besides management. And it says something I (unfortunately) overlooked initially--the company can, at their sole discretion, extend the probation period indefinitely. It also states (not included in original contract) that in the event of termination, they can give me payment in lieu of advance notice. This is pretty bad for me because I am an international employee, so if I get fired my visa expires and I have 1 week maximum to pack all my stuff and leave the country--a country where I have mostly built my life the last 5 years.\n\nSo honestly at this point I just feel like this company is extremely stiff and rigid. In our first round of salary negotiations last year, they refused to budge at all. Then again during March they also refused to grant me a single thing I requested--they just said \"XYZ is standard for our international employees, we can't change it.\" It really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. And now, finally I get the final contract and my bonus is written out. I requested that they remove  their ability to extend the probation period, and they once again said they cannot remove that language, it is standard in all contracts.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from just refusing to sign is I want to keep my reputation. I feel like going back on them a 2nd time will destroy my local reputation and recruiters that they or others may know will think badly of me, and news will get around. Other than that, honestly, a 3% salary raise is not at all worth all this hassle. \n\nShould I try to stay at my current job (I am about 90% sure they would let me stay), or just suck up the missteps I've already made?

I'd spend the time grinding leetcode, working on a project I was thinking about monetizing as well as to improve my skills as a fullstack developer, getting better at system design, and interviewing.\n\nI average about 10-12 interviews/week currently (it seems many just seem to want someone more senior in the end and I get rejected but I do have some next rounds scheduled), so I'm concerned that if I quit, a possible interviewer will be concerned by the fact that I didn't stay at my job for at least a year.

Projects were boring all the time (desktop apps), and I was interested in doing web dev, so I decided to apply to a Frontend position and got hired in 2015 in a digital agency, where I've had the chance to work on a variety of projects using several of the most popular JS frameworks. It was there where I really learned the software development cycle, versioning, testing, among other stuff.\n\nThe first two years I used to engage in long learning curves whenever I started a new project (we do mostly outsourced maintenance of existing projects). I would spend hours reading documentation, testing, googling, and debugging during ramp-up phases. And I kinda hoped this curve would get shorter with time as I got more experienced. But the truth is that it never did.\n\nBecause of how diverse and complex FE projects can be technology-wise, every time that I have to switch to a new team or project, I feel like I am starting from scratch. Like day 1. There can be a new framework with hundreds of new dependencies that I've never seen in my life or a strange integration of js libraries that somehow somebody managed to put together to build a set of web forms that could've been easily implemented in a different approach.\n\nAnd it's so frustrating because I have to be asking tons of questions all the time, onboarding sessions are never enough and mentorship is nonexistent most of the time. I get stuck easily and it takes me forever to catch up. At a personal level, it makes me feel constantly incompetent and forever inexperienced until eventually, I manage to fully understand everything.\n\nI know code maintenance can be hell. And I know every project and every company is different. But in my case, I haven't had the luck to grow as much as I wanted during these years as a FE developer. Maybe maintenance doesn't make you grow as much. Maybe FE is actually a huge mess. Or maybe I have the wrong impression of how experience translates into learning curve times. But the truth is that it can be very overwhelming.\n\nHas anybody here gone through something similar?\n\nAny tips to speed up learning curves?\n\nThank you",

It's essentially my dream job because I get to work on something that I've been using for a couple of years now, but I'm feeling dumb and it's taking a toll on me mentally.\n\nI'm aware of imposter syndrome, and know that everyone experiences it. In fact, a senior engineer was telling me today that he still goes to our staff engineer every now and then and asks the same question he asked before (I try to avoid this to show that I'm learning and write things down).\n\nHowever, I can't help but feel dumb and useless when my team and I have a meeting discussing technical subjects I've never used/have very little knowledge of, and stay silent the whole time because I don't even know what kind of question to ask, and I get increasingly reluctant to ask questions since we're all remote and don't want to be pinging my coworkers all day preventing them from doing their work. Some days I look at code and literally freeze up because I don't even know where to begin. \n\nMy coworkers are all really friendly, so it isn't a case of them showing toxic behavior like \"you should know this\" or anything like that (no matter how many times I create the scenario in my head that it secretly is). In fact, they've told me they like some of the ideas that I've implemented into our product to improve the user experience. \n\nHow do I get myself out of this mental state and fix this? I spend time outside of work each day learning whatever I don't understand that's discussed, but I don't want it to lead to burnout and impact my productivity and risk losing my job.",

        "body": "TLDR: first engineering job is toxic and I feel isolated and depressed. Got stuck doing shitty work and not learning. Working with senior dev who drives good engineers away and management has no intention to address it. Should I quit and focus on my mental health and interviewing? Or will that hurt my second job hunt a lot \ud83e\udd14 \n\nHi all. I\u2019ve been in my first engineering job for about 10 months and I\u2019ve been seriously contemplating quitting for about a month. It started off as a good experience because I had a great senior engineer mentor on my team but once she left I realized that she shielded me from working with the senior developer who everyone dislikes. She left during a reorg where both my supportive manager and coworkers that I like got moved to a different team and I was left working with people who are all doing their own things. The senior developer is the only one I get to work with and his code is bad, the whole team depends on him, and I got stuck doing shit work for months (moving an app to production) so I basically just spend all day trying to get his code to run on my computer and he\u2019s constantly changing it so I have to constantly meet with him. All of the code stuff I\u2019m doing is shitty configuration stuff and it\u2019s never ending. I\u2019m not learning or building and everyday I have to say \u201cstill working on the same thing\u201d in scrum. The senior dev is not friendly, very condescending, mansplained the terminal to me, and basically just does what he wants since he\u2019s been here forever. Adding on to all of that, I started my first job during the pandemic and throughout everything that\u2019s been going on with BLM, Stop asian hate, etc. no one on my team talks about what\u2019s going on. Add on to that that I\u2019m the only woman of color on a team of 20 men and I\u2019ve started hating and resenting my job to the point where I have crying breakdowns everyday. I\u2019ve also expressed my frustrations to my manager months ago and asked to get put on a different project but nothing has happened. I hate the company culture and a bunch of people have left my team as well. I\u2019ve given up on pushing for change here and I\u2019ve started job hunting. I\u2019m trying to hold out longer but part of me is wondering if I should just quit and focus on my mental health and interviewing. I have about 3-4 months of savings saved up as well. I\u2019m mostly concerned about losing negotiating power or having to job hunt/explain my situation in interviews. I\u2019m also concerned about not having my first job tenure be a whole year & the idea of potentially not finding a job for months. Any thoughts? I\u2019m trying to hold out but my mental health is worse than it\u2019s ever been. \n\nAdvice would be much appreciated especially from people who have found a second eng job during Covid!",

        "body": "I've been feeling increasingly uneasy about my career as I go over my mid thirties. I don't think I'll ever enjoy managing people just to manage, but I do enjoy being a team leader and staying technical. Over the past 2 years I've been shadowing local dentists (9 month gap during pandemic) and really enjoyed it. I'm thinking of using my savings to fund my way through dental school, as the older dentists I shadowed had extreme work life balance, high salary, and job stability. They all typical work 32 hours over 4 days, no call, rare emergency overtime, and seem to get more desirable with age.\n\nThe cs folks I work with over 40 tend to take 2 paths. The lucky successful ones (10% of people or less) get m7 mbas and move into the upper echelons, making great money with terrible hours. The remaining 90% of people on my path tend to settle into middle management, face lay offs, lack autonomy, face wage stagnation, and generally seem unhappy.\n\nI applied to a competitive pre dental program with over 90% acceptance rate to dental schools but I'm getting cold feet as everyone I know is telling me it's not worth it (5 years long, 300k tuition plus lost wage). I'm also worried in the future dentistry will go cities l corporate and I'll be a slave to production.\n\nAm I wrong in thinking ageism will hurt me in my current career without a masters degree? Am I looking at dentistry with rose tinted glasses? Any older math/cs folks regret staying in the career after 40?",

I like money.\n\n2. Fashion isn't exciting and there's no room for meaningful innovation. Besides which consumers are simply not interested in fashion, like yeah sure everyone wants a Louis Vuitton or whatever but there's no value for craftsmanship or design, only 'hype'. The pandemic has forced the industry into an existential crisis and it seems like a sinking ship to me.\n\n3. I want to be part of a meaningful community that doesn't have its head up it's a\\*\\*, tech/coding/UX/UI seems like a nice bunch of people... but I don't know that yet.\n\n5. I don't want to live in NY/Cali.\n\nI know people keep saying it's a trendy field and everyone is career-hopping into it but nonetheless, I have a few questions:\n\n\n1. Is it worth it? Will it stay relevant? Is the money good? Is the work culture good (or at least not as toxic as fashion)?\n\n2. Do I need another degree? I would rather not get another degree or Bootcamp. I'd rather be self-taught or a certificate. Is that a legitimate route to go or will I be wasting my time?\n\n3. Are there any transferable skills between Fashion Design and software? I can make tech packs and spec sheets, 3D model a dress, draft patterns and textile prints, cut and sew a garment and photograph to sell.. but how do these skills transfer to something like software development? \n\n4. What does it take to get a well-paying job? The people I know in software keep boasting about 110k straight out of college, now that's rare obliviously, what kind of starting salary is reasonable and how does it scale with experience?",

How long did that take?\n* Was there any catalyst for you to begin on this path?\n* How did you transition from a job to a business?\n* How did you find co-founders (if any)?\n* How did you find customers?\n* How did you get starting capital or was it all savings?\n* How did you hunt for talent (first key employees)?\n* How was your first year compared to expectations?\n* How long did it take to get to a point where you are better off financially and mentally in this new role?\n* What advice would you give yourself if you were just starting out in this business?\n\nThank you to all sharing their stories! I hope they'll inspire and motivate the rest of us.",

        "body": "Hey everyone. I'm a (formerly) lead developer based in the Rust Belt. Have about 12 years experience, skill wise I have had my hands all over the place. My last company went belly up due to the pandemic and earlier this year I started interviewing.\n\nWith remote jobs popping off, a whole new world was opened up for me with job opportunities. I got 5 offers since January. Some gave me close or near my low Rust Belt salary, or the benefits weren't great so I turned them down. Then I got an offer from a mid sized West Coast company (remote).\n\nThe job was for a mid level developer role and their salary was amazing for me, so I took it. But then I took the job and found out that the job itself is way beneath me skills wise.... and I haven't even wrote a single line of code in the 2 months I've been there. So here are my pros and cons:\n\nCons:\n\n- Haven't wrote any code, worried I will stagnate skills wise over time.\n\n- They mislead me, so not exactly hyped about that\n\n- Company is going through a transitionary period, a good number of people have left and been backfilled\n\nPros:\n\n- Pay is WAY more than I can get locally. For reference my friend works in my city as a senior dev and gets $40k less than I do for a tough dev job, while I tweak XML files and other easy stuff. Pay is also more than I got with other remote offers\n\n- Great benefits (unlimited PTO with 20 days minimum encouraged, employee perks, don't have to commute)\n\n- I like my coworkers and they like me\n\n- Low stress. No micromanagement, no one cares what schedule you work, job is a breeze, no panic attacks come deadline time. And best of all, NO DAILY STANDUPS OR SCRUM SHIT!!!\n\nSo I am thinking about just sticking it out for a year. After all the mental stress put on by the pandemic, I feel like I could use a year to work a low stress job and remove myself from the rat race, at least for awhile. However, I am worried that I will stagnate and not interview well in a year. I have no problem getting offers now, and I figure that down the line I can work on my Github and stuff again and get back up to speed.\n\nWhat do you think? Is it worth the risk this far into my career?",

I have zero experience in the entire field, I have zero experience in tech in general.  I used to be a chef for a living. I was hired after I finished a coding bootcamp. \n\nThis is my first tech job and the company is aware of this. I have had 6 1on1s with my boss but I feel like I'm not asking the appropriate questions. He hasn't mentioned anything about it but I feel like I'm going to be expected to ask the job related questions now but I fear I still don't really know what it is I'm supposed to be doing. I was told to learn the test automation and be able to do the automation for when we do production release and I've attempted it but I always end up making the test fail and communication with the people in charge of this hasn't really been available and to boot, i think one of the two is on vacation or sick leave at the moment. I'm expected to do a run next Friday.\n\nI've been tasked to learn and I update on my learning. I went to a bootcamp and learned the MERN stack but this company deals with their own proprietary stack so every time I try to learn something I just say .. \"well I learned this and I can see the similarity of this with what is being used in our codebase\" and it seems to be a reasonable explanation to my inability to understand the code thoroughly but I don't know how much longer I can explain that way. \n\nI feel like there's  not much mentorship but I don't know if a month and a half is what they expect to be enough to start on asking more work specific questions and not finding similarities on what I was learning and the codebase that exists already.\n\nSo to my question, what sort of questions can I ask my manager to communicate that I want to be able to understand the codebase but I need some more guidance than what I am receiving now? Basically like 1 to 2 people talking to me a per week and tell me to update my access requests and they will connect with me again later when that's done. When I do get pass that they are busy and can't talk to me again and I'm just left to watching pluralsight videos all day. I'm not complaining, I just feel like I'm still not really learning what I need to learn specifically related to the job and that they will think I will not be good enough for this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the rant.

How hard is it to transition from Android - > Backend (Python/Golang)? And how hard is backend development compared to Android development?\n\nThanks!",

        "body": "I'm a former bootcamp dev (non-CS degree) who upon graduation was hired to a job where I primarily wrote React. Circumstances changed and I was hired to a company to write React to start with the caveat I learn Java along the way.\n\nI don't like Java. I've tried over and over again to learn it and my interest level does not allow me to stay engaged. If I could sit at a desk and write React for 40 hours a week and log off, that would be my dream. I love React and in total I have about 3 years of professional React experience.\n\nI bought the JetBrains Hyperskill Java course and while I think it is good for theory, I think personally it is a bad resource for a beginner who doesn't know the right questions to ask. It isn't cutting it for my development.\n\nI'm not in a situation where I must learn Java or I'll get fired, but my motivation to learn it is just not there so I am polling the room on how I can improve my circumstance.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Are there jobs out there that are front-end exclusive that pay $90k+? (My preferred salary - I believe my skills are strong enough to warrant this, but please sound off if you think this is high for my expectations - also NYC area preferably remote). \n\n1a. If these jobs exist, are they rare? (I'm fortunate to have had good references for my previous positions so I don't know this answer from experience.)\n\n2. What resources, even if paid, do you personally think are great for learning Java? I need something else besides Hyperskill and Pluralsight videos but I refuse to do another bootcamp.\n\n3. Am I being a little punk? Or is Java not as bad as I'm making it out to be? Keep in mind my undergrad was in political science but I'm not the weakest in math, but coming from JavaScript, this is just not my cup of tea.\n\nAll opinions welcomed and very appreciated!",

Currently, I have 2 options: the MCDS program at CMU and the MS CS at UCSD. So I have the following 3 questions related to the university and post-grad outcomes:\n\n1. While I heard getting opportunities at FAANG for an ML position are quite difficult, will it help if I take up the specialized Data Science program at CMU? There is also an AI specialization at UCSD. But I am not sure how helpful that would be while looking for an ML position, since the degree still is MS CS.\n2. Is there any compensation difference between people graduating from top-tier universities vs other schools? (or between CMU grad vs UCSD grads, to be specific)\n3. I already have 3 YOE, will I be considered for a new-grad position if I wish to switch to ML from Big Data?\n\nA little background: In my 3 yrs at my current company, I tried multiple times to switch to an ML position, but unsuccessfully. The recruiters that contacted me always offered a data engineer position. Whenever I expressed an interest in working for the ML team, they mentioned I wasn't a good fit. So, it makes me wonder if the situation would still be the same after an MS?",

However, I recently got another offer at MITRE as a Cybersecurity intern. Whatever I choose would be my first internship experience. \n\nThe crux of the issue is that while the first offer aligns well with my interests, it is with a smaller and less well known company (\\~250 employees). Still has seemingly robust intern program, and there is a good chance I could land a job there after.\n\nThe offer at MITRE involves a larger intern program and company in general, but I do not have as much knowledge about cybersecurity. The subject matter still sounds interesting, and I've been advised that just the name would help me when applying for jobs even though its not in the exact field I was looking into.\n\nAny insight as to which would be a more valuable experience in my position would be much appreciated.

I've been trying to get internship in sophomore year but during Covid a lot of companies canceled the internships so there wasn't any luck.\n\nCollege wasn't exactly helpful because they had to deal with more than half students who didn't manage to find an internship. \n\nManaged to get accepted to the internship but the found out that it's isn't suitable for college requirements. \n\nI'm mostly good at Java and React Native. So there weren't a lot of positions suited for me.\nI've been applying to internships that was available to me. I get passed at CV screening and even do good at the interviews but sometimes I get really anxious at technical questions that I almost forget everything only after the interview I realize  that I could have done so much better answering those questions since then I've been studying questions about algorithms more. \n\nI also get take home assigments but sometimes it's either clashes the college assignment deadline or I have to learn new language and framework to do the assigments. Once I have given assigment to the algorithm that didn't exist (at least when I tried to find mathematical formula of it in scholar.google.com). Other time I managed to complete the assigment and build a Springboot backend but the company replied that I didn't do the requirements that wasn't listed in their task. \n\nPerhaps I wasn't exactly dedicated to the programming as my peers were, since I was also busy with my second hobby? \n\nPrevious semester I've had to take 7 classes (In Lithuania you can't select how many classes per semester you should take) so I didn't have time to built my portfolio though I have college assignments in github but I don't think that's enough. \n\nCurrently I just feel hopelessness and tired. Though I will be applying to more companies before I would have to take an academic leave perhaps then I would have time to make portfolio.\n\nSo far I applied in LinkedIn, Glassdoor and other lithuanian websites that dedicated for internships. \n\nI would like to hear suggestions on where else I could apply to and what else I could work on.\n\nI'd be happy to get an internship that will be accepted by college even the internship will be unpaid and have to learn new language.",

What I realized is that regardless of funding, it does not stop them from having the most unpredictable hiring practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne startup promised me they would consider me for fully remote and that location is not issue for them.  Well, the boomer cofounders decided that they will not be a WFH company, and that they want people in the office at least 4 days a week in the Bay Area.  I decided no thanks, and withdrew my application.\n\n\n\n\n\n6 months ago, I applied for a backend engineering position at one startup.  The recruiter interview went well, then started talking with the hiring manager.  He literally told me that he has zero intention of hiring me for the role in the first minute of the interview, and asked me if I would be willing to interview with them a few months into the future when data-related roles open up.  6 months later, the only job postings this company has is a few account manager jobs.\n\n\n\n\nAnother startup had a lengthy technical interview process.  I did great, but they rejected me because of \"lack of fit\".  Whatever that means, but I typically do well with other companies that have more behavioral interviews.\n\n\n\nWith these hiring practices, it seems like startups will never be able to compete with bigger companies in terms of hiring talent.  There is a lot of people who are willing to work at startups if it meant not doing hundreds of leetcode problems.  I personally would take a very small paycut at my next job if this was possible and if I could work on interesting projects.\n\n\n\n\nStartups with old-fashioned views of WFH will never attract quality engineers if they can't offer WFH to their engineers when they are paying below market value.\n\n\n\n\n\nStartups have the opportunity to attract a lot of talent, but their hiring practices prevent it.",

I'm the kind of guy that wants to work hard for 8 hours then go home and relax. \nIs there hope for me to retain these things in this career? Or should I start exploring other options?\n\nEdit: reduced extraneous info",

It is less stable employment, being contract-based, but **I would effectively** ***double*** **what I'm taking home** for the same job title. I wouldn't even have to move. I'm young and healthy, with no children, so I don't use the great federal benefits as much as others.\n\nWhat would you do? Do I shed the golden handcuffs?",

I graduated med school last year and will be finishing my first year of residency this summer.\n\nI don't love medicine and the specialty I chose is not going to set me up with a ton of opportunities.  The job market outlook right now is - \"if you're open to moving almost anywhere in the country you'll find a job.  If not, do a 2nd or 3rd fellowship\".  Chances are I'll also be restricted to academia and its salaries.  I'll be making ~60k for the next 3 years and will probably be looking at 150k-200k in 4-5 years, then low 200s several years after that.   Certainly not something to scoff at, but also not the \"doctor money\" some people expect.  Medicine also comes with insurance that will cut into my salary.\n\nI have become increasingly interested in technology and computer programming over the past 5 years.  So much so that I'm considering leaving to become a software engineer.\n\nWould this be absolutely insane?  It wouldn't take much to beat my work satisfaction right now and I already sit in front of a computer all day.\n\nI think my main concerns about making the switch are my ability to make a salary in the same ballpark while having similar benefits (4-6 weeks paid vacation, health insurance) and not being too late to the game to be able to succeed and move up the career ladder.  I'm in my early 30s.\n\nConcerns about staying in medicine are my relative lack of opportunities, the need to move several times in the next several years, and the fact that I just don't like it all that much anymore.   Switching specialities could fix some of this but I think I'd like software engineering more than I'd like any other specialty.\n\nThanks!",

It's been a slog,(long hours, only made worse by the pandemic), coupled with repetitive work. I took night classes and courses to be able to land a job in what I THOUGHT I wanted to do, Software Development.  \n\n\nWell now I left my old IT job and landed this Cloud Development job...and it's more of the same frustrations I had previously. Tight deadlines, long work hours, no one is invested in your career development, hours spent learning a company's business logic to apply numbers to...in other words, another grind. I LIKE working on my personal projects like web apps and games, but I go into work and that love just shuts off completely.   \n\n\nIDK how I should be feeling about this; just wanted to see if anyone has felt anything similar, or if it got better? Maybe it's just the companies/positions I'm working in? Admittedly, Covid HAS made work culture worse in the companies I work for. I don't have a problem asking for help, but that gets difficult when everyone's busy and I don't have a human being to sit next to. Kind of wanted to hear anyone's thoughts, if it isn't a bother.\n\nI'm juggling the thought of taking a lesser-paying, less stressful job elsewhere, then work on personal projects on my off time.

I'm located in San Diego, and it would be great to stay, but I understand that the job search is very difficult here so I am not opposed to moving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading!",

But my actual skills aren't as honed as they could be. I feel like I'm nearly being punished for studying engineering instead of computer science, we never studied data structures and algorithms so I feel automatically behind other interviewees.\n\nHas anyone found themselves in a situation like this? And how did they find an area they enjoy and are good at?\n\nAny advice would be soo greatly appreciated,\n\u270c\ufe0f",

The tasks assigned to me by my supervisor feel so out of my league. I had to submit some pretty lousy work and it's making me feel extremely guilty. Just now I had to tell him I really couldn't do one of the tasks he gave to me and I felt like I just hit a new low. \n\nI should be learning and helping out the main team but at this point I feel like I am really slowing them down. A lot of the program I had to write here are done in languages that I have no prior experience with so I had to spend a lot of time just looking up the basics of the programming language itself. I have been skipping lunch these few days just so I can spend more time working but in the end I still end up with some shitty work instead.\n\nSorry for the wall of text that I'm not even sure belongs on this subreddit or not, but I really needed to vent a bit.",

I come to you all in need of some feedback and advice in regards to what you believe I may have been doing wrong in my job search process. I graduated last year in August, and have been looking for jobs since September.\n\nFortunately, I was able to secure a few interviews in which I felt that I did well as an Entry Level candidate however, after a few days of each of them, I would wake up to rejection emails suggesting that I did not have enough work experience or, an email directly from the interviewer suggesting that they found a candidate who had at least 1-2 years of experience more than me. \n\nI did two internships during the summer after my sophomore and junior year (2nd went on for 6 months until Covid hit and I got laid off - FML) however, they had a hiring freeze throughout 2020 and I received a rejection that went along the lines of the context I mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\nThroughout the past few months, I've just been depressed after receiving countless rejections, however, I did prepare myself for it, as the times are very difficult due to covid, but the impact of rejections was inevitable as it took a toll on my mental health. \n\nThis past week, I gathered myself and have been putting in the maximum effort towards job search in hopes of success. I have been working in a startup part-time to maintain my visa status as I am an international student which I feel has provided me some valuable experience that I can now bring into my resume. \n\nYesterday, I was considering exploring different paths/fields with my Computer Science knowledge and experience such as Salesforce Development and Data Analysis but I am a little misguided in regards to them and would appreciate any guidance that anyone may have.\n\nI would also be grateful if you had any feedback or recommendations in regards to how I should up my game in job search and practicing interview questions on leetcode. I am a small Liberal Arts College grad who's looking for any sort of opportunity. Harsh feedback is welcome as well. Thank you for your time!\n\nTL;DR: 2020 Grad still unemployed seeking guidance in job search and exploring other paths.",

Two data points:\n   * Less than 10% of my pull requests ever get comments that give me the impression that the reviewer at least looked at some of the code.\n   * There are exactly two reviewers that we send PRs to, this on a team of about 10 people. Nobody else ever gets to review anyone else's code.\n\nMy conclusion is that the reviewers either aren't taking their role seriously, or don't know what they're doing. (I'm quite sure my code is less than stellar.)\n\nI'm looking to switch to a company that does take code review seriously where lead developers are actually interested in what they and their team are doing.\n\n* Are there signals I can look for or questions I can ask to gauge if a potential employer is serious about code review or not?\n* Can I rely on a potential employer being honest about their coding culture?\n* How can I diplomatically phrase this need in speech or in writing?",

After this subject, I will likely have another internship secured over the summer holidays (in Aus) at a reputable company.\n\nOption 2 is basically working full time for 6 months at another reputable company, therefore it will be difficult to study on the side and I will need to defer university by 6 months.\n\nOption 3 is just the 3 month internship from option 1 - is one internship sufficient/competitive?\n\nWhich would be preferable and increase my chances of getting a good full time job? \n\nIs it worth deferring my graduation for experience?\n\nThank you!",

So I have put together a few options and I would like to get some opinions as to which course of action I should take:\n\n1. Programming Bootcamp (will have to be remote due to my location)- Pros: Networking, certification, refine my skills, access to teachers for questions, they will likely improve my chances of getting hired at a high paying job. Cons: Expensive, lengthy, no guarantee of job quickly, I will have to put up with my current job for about another year.\n2. Unpaid Internship- Pros: Networking, experience with interviews, work experience to put on a resume, real experience with programming within an organization, access to higher level devs for questions, I could possibly graduate to a paid position? Cons: Unpaid, no guarantee of graduating to paid position, experience on resume still may not be enough for future job hunt.\n\nWhat do, frens?",

I also get excellent benefits and healthcare. This offer sounds great except for the fact that it is a rotational program and it requires me to relocated to Kennesaw, GA first and then Charlotte, NC or Seattle, WA. The job is an application development in C++ and C#, or implement REST based APIs in a service-based architecture. This doesn\u2019t sound bad, but I currently work as a software engineer/(mobile developer) at a small company in Tampa, FL. I love my current job because I get to work as the main mobile developer/engineer which it amazing giving that is my first job and mobile development is the field that I always wanted to be in since before graduating from college. This job gives me a lot of freedom, so much that for the past 4 months I been working remotely from Puerto Rico and my boss is pretty easy going with how I organize my daily work schedule. Unfortunately, my currently salary is below average even for a job located in FL. My salary is 55k, but I have been living very comfortably because I don\u2019t need to pay rent in Puerto Rico and the cost of living here is significantly lower than in Tampa, FL. My dilemma is, should I take this new job offer and leave my current job? I made a cost analysis of all the expenses I would inquire if I accept this new job offer and my net gains after all expenses is only like $400 more than what I\u2019m currently making/saving on a monthly basis. All my family and friends are either in Puerto Rico or Tampa so GA would be apart from all of them and I not sure the extra money is worth moving apart from all of them, but I don\u2019t know if I should let this opportunity slip away since the salary is so high. Should I mention the offer to my current employer and ask if they would at least give me a 10k increase on my salary? I have only been working for my current employer for four months so I\u2019m relatively new. Also, is me not taking this job offer limiting my chances of getting an even higher salary in the future? Should I stick to mobile development if I'm enjoying it so much? What is the best course of action for someone in my position?",

        "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nI got offered a full-time SWE position for a mid-to-high tier US based tech company, at one of their Canadian offices. The TC is pretty good for a Canadian new grad position and it is a company I would enjoy working for and has good learning and growth opportunities. \n\nHowever, the TC does not compare to that of high tier US tech companies, and is also less than that which the US offices for this company offers. I know people say cost-of-living is different but the Canadian office is located in one of the most expensive cities in North America (and I'm also 'meh' about the prospect of living there). Furthermore, I still have 1 year left before graduation and still have 1 more internship left to complete as part of my degree so I'm still quite ambitious on aiming for a better offer at a higher tier company -- which I believe is achievable given my recent internship experience at the company who gave me the FT offer.\n\nSo my question to ya'll is, would you simply decline the offer (the ethical choice) or accept the offer with the intent of reneging if something better comes along in that year before graduating? \n\nP.S. I know there's a faq on reneging offers, but I think my situation may be somewhat nuance in that I haven't yet accepted the offer on the table...",

        "body": "For some background, I've been working around 5 years in corporate healthcare IT (very much customer facing; not really any coding/programming experience required at all). I've been feeling very much like I needed to go elsewhere for a while but I haven't had a good push as the job pays OK and offers great benefits (but with 0 upward mobility).\n\nHowever, last week I had a medical incident and at this point I'm not sure if I'll be able to safely drive as much (if at all), even going up and down stairs can be a challenge. I'm on medical leave from work while waiting on specialists and referrals etc. but I'm coming from an IT job that involved a large amount of walking. And work from home would be challenging as we already have a help desk that handles most remote issues (management already decided to not let people WFH as there was fear of just downsizing and outsourcing everyone).\n\nI realized that it'd be much better for me in the long term to switch to a career that allows more work from home/flexibility and could hopefully offer much better pay - right now with my current job I don't see myself having a long term career/retirement plan, and until I hear from my doctors I'm stuck on medical leave wondering if I'll even be able to go back to my job.\n\nI've been looking into coding bootcamps (as I'd rather not spend 4 years in school racking up tons of debt), but a lot seem really sketchy. The one I see most advertised/recommended is App Authority, but there's literally no way to schedule a talk with admissions (which seems really suspicious). They claim you pay nothing upfront until you \"find a job\" making $50k+, but they don't specify that it's a software engineer job. My current job I make a little over $50k, so it would be nice to avoid paying large sums while at a job I may or may not be able to go back to at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** I'm in my late 30s, may or may not be disabled/unable to walk/drive reliably, and want to break into software engineering/half-stack/full-stack. Where the heck do I start? Have a small amount of experience with C++/Python but nothing serious. TIA",

The pay would be $50/hour, and is about 30% more than I make now. I want to take it, but my gut is telling me no. \n\nTo start off, I think the firm outsourced to India which isn't bad, but the recruiter or HR rep don't understand verbal english. So phone conversations go nowhere. The second red flag was when the recruiter lied about me getting the position and started asking for my social. I reached out straight to my interviewer and he said he didn't make a decision yet. Also when I asked the recruiter if I'd have insurance, can take time off, he said yes to all of it. Yet the paperwork from HR listed my position as a computer programmer (all docusign btw, no workday for onboarding) without insurance. \n\nI told them when I have proof from Walmart I got the position I'll fill out the paperwork. Finally this week a person who is english proficient reached out and sent an email screenshot of Walmart confirming to move forward with me. I reached out to the interviewer from Walmart to discuss long term career expectations to make sure this purely a 6 month contract and we chat tomorrow. \n\nSo I feel trapped between a rock and a hard place. I would love the opportunity and experience working somewhere like Walmart could offer (it's supply chain tech), however I am STRESSED about having anything to do with Saicon. There are SO many red flags I'm questioning if it's even worth the risk. Has anyone heard or worked with Saicon?

        "body": "Hello,\n\nFirst Reddit post in a long time!\n\nStory time: I am an engineering student, I have an associates in manufacturing engineering. Currently going for my bachelors. I have been a machinist for 5 years, minus 6 months where I was a tooling engineer before being demoted due to the pandemic. Shortly after I followed a coworker to a different company as it was made clear that my engineering position was being eliminated even after business picked up.\n\nI recently was reached out to by a friend who's small shop was looking for another manufacturing engineer. The place offered me the position with no raise (I am paid very well for a machinist, I produce excellent results), and the benefits are not as good seeing as it is a much smaller shop then the one I work at. However, the way I see it is that engineering experience will help my engineering career in the long run compared to more machining experience. (It's not really a field that can be peaked, but I feel like anything else I learn would only be useful if I stayed being a machinist).\n\nSo with that job offer in hand, I gave my notice at my current job. Immediately upon doing so I was told to talk to the plant manager and explain the situation. I did so, while explaining that the company had treated me excellently, and that I was not leaving due to an increase in pay but rather more suitable work experience.\n\nI was made a counter offer which will be given to me in writing on monday that states something to the following effect: I will become an associate manufacturing engineer, the company will reimburse the next 2 years of my tuition and upon completion I will be promoted to manufacturing engineer. However the duties of associate manufacturing engineer will not start for a few months while they free someone up to operate my machines.\n\nIn the machining/manufacturing world, it's completely normal for things to take a bit because skilled labor is hard to come by (especially now, given the current job market). I also did not find any reason to doubt the legitimacy of his want for me to fill this position. There is a lifetime employee/engineer retiring in a year or 2, and the other engineers have purchased tooling that has made me want to bang my head into a wall, causing real issues in the shop. I was a tooling engineer at one point, so there have been times I have told them things weren't going to work before even producing parts. (so far, I've won that argument every time after they try it anyways.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my question with that all out of the way is: should I consider the counter offer? I have always heard they are bad to accept. However I do enjoy my current company, I just want to start my engineering career and start to leave my machining one behind.

        "body": "Honestly speaking, I've had multiple mental breakdowns over this past week. I just feel completely lost on how to go about getting started on my cs career. Especially since I feel I already wasted my time this past 10 years with a college education that didn't get me anywhere.  \n\nI am starting a CS program this fall and have no programming knowledge. I was initially interested in game dev but I know that its not the best field to go into if you want to have good pay and a comfortable work/life balance. Anyway, I bought rob miles yellow book and have been slowly going through it, then I plan to take a Udemy course on developing 2d games. My goal is to be able to land a job as a Unity dev by next summer. \n\nBut now I am having doubts. I want to be making 6 figures or close to it eventually, I understand this is going to take time. I am just doubting if going this route of C# and unity is the way to go. Or is there a better way for me to start right now? Just feeling completely lost and would appreciate any advice. I am in Canada btw. \n\nI guess since I have wasted so much time already I am afraid of choosing the wrong path and wasting even more time. What's the fastest path to a job in 1 year time that I can learn while in my first year, and in turn is that path going to help me earn 6 figures eventually down the road?\n\nSorry if I am asking ignorant questions here, I just really need help in getting out of this rut.",

My original intention was to continue on to do my Phd in computer science, but due to some personal and professional reasons I won't be going into a Phd program immediately, or even for a few years.\n\nMy master's was focused on cryptography, and I managed to publish a few papers in good venues. My problem is that my work was theoretical, (think mostly math) so I don't necessarily have as much applied knowledge as my peers. I also didn't hold any relevant internships (I know, bad decision) and instead opted to do research over the summer.\n\nI was thinking of trying to get into cybersecurity, since it is closely related to what I have done. I am looking at grinding out a Comptia a+ certification and applying for IT technician roles, then transitioning to cybersecurity, but to be honest the pay seems a bit underwhelming. \n\nAre there any other career paths which I have overlooked which would fit my skills? \nWhat other certifications/skills should I be looking at to make myself more appealing?\n\nI appreciate you taking the time to read this and respond, thank you.",

        "body": "As an introduction, I'm a senior at a top 50 school double majoring cs + economics (biggest regret tbh). I was a junior last year doing well having had done 10+ APs for some credit, national merit finalist in hs etc so generally good student and was doing well but then covid struck and we all got kicked out of housing (avoiding personal info) I went without access to internet and was forced to move into an environment I avoided for years. I became incredibly depressed and basically couldn't be bothered to finish my classes even though I basically just had to open and take the final ( I was so miserable and shameful of myself I thought I deserved to fail even if I could pass). I failed 3 classes just from avoidance and got withdrawn from the university and on top of that I went through a breakup and that was the cherry on top.\n\nI appealed late in the summer when I felt a bit better and I thought I couldn't tell anyone that that happened and they luckily let me back in. I miraculously went back and my financial aid was miraculously given back as well at the sympathy of a counselor. I started to feel better around the fall, and somehow luckily I got a job around December at a very reputable company for xx engineering with a great program. The thing is the mental health issues left me barely scraping by as I wasn't properly able to be productive and got basically all D's in all my classes which was fine for graduating I suppose, but I'm nearing the end of spring semester and the classes I have exams for I could cram and take, but my very very last cs class in circuitry was asynchronous and I basically didn't even look at it doing half the assignments, missed all quizzes and lab attendance grade, and the final is in a week. I'm confident in my ability to do well on the final tbh, but even then it looks like I won't be able to pass the class.\n\nMy job is set to start in mid June, and I don't think I'll ever be lucky enough to receive an offer as amazing as this job in the current job climate and in general. It's basically 100k salary w amazing benefits and opportunities at a top 50 company. I can't take this class in the summer as it's not offered either. I emailed the professor recently and he said he's a little sympathetic but unless I get a doctor's note for some assignments, he is being strict with all his deadlines and giving 0's a minute late grading policy. I really don't know what to do and I've heard of people taking jobs and not saying anything which tbh seems possible in this case, but I also am afraid of the risks of that backfiring and sorta disappointed having done the work for 2 majors and not getting a degree. I really haven't told anyone about this as my peers are so happy for me, but graduation is in a few weeks (luckily optional so I don't have to tell family) and it's eating at me inside. Only in the last few weeks I've started to get my shit together from the support of a few incredible supportive people to recover my other classes but this one class seems unsalvageable.\n\nWhat should I even do? My friends family and relatives are all expecting me to graduate with this job. Should I just start the job and not look back? Or do I tell my company, lose the opportunity, and take another semester in the fall to graduate (if my university even lets me attend again after failing so many classes). It's so stupid that I did this to myself especially when looking back all I had to do was the bare minimum, but I also can't forget how debilitating the shame and depression that I went through lead me here. If I start my job too, I think I'm really confident that I will do really well. I have no idea what to do I just need to hear opinions.",

It is a regular private company, but recently, my boss said he chose me and a couple other devs on our team to get security clearance because we might need to handle sensitive data with the government. I wasn't worried because I have no criminal history. However, I'm now realizing how intense this is. They want like 10 different contacts from my life ranging over the past 7 years, and say if you lie on the form you can get fined and go to jail.

I just feel sad because this is a great company and I don't think I'm ready to leave yet. Am I overreacting? The way I see it, either I lie on the clearance and risk any penalty that would happen to me (I read the gov will reach out to all my friends and try to know me better than I know myself), OR I answer truthfully and my clearance is failed, and my company would probably see the reason I failed( that I have done lots of drugs, all the time), and that would be really embarrassing/possibly grounds for termination if they aren't ok with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, am I overreacting?

        "body": "I'm a recent graduate from a CS program in Canada looking to land my first full-time job in software development. My problem mainly stems from the fact that I feel that I don't really have the skills that most companies are looking for due to some off-kilter experience.\n\nAs for why that is: I actually did a dual degree in Computer Science and Engineering Physics (EP first, then started CS in 3rd year). This was partially because EP has few job prospects unless you're going into research or are gung-ho about space (which I am not), and partially because I wanted to get an internship through the CS department's internship program (which worked out, thankfully). Throughout these degrees, my accumulated experience amounts to 3 summers of research writing data analysis code for radar and satellite data (with 2 papers published with co-author credits) and a 16-month internship writing image analysis code for a university group that was half research group and half startup company (its weird). As for projects, I was focused on my classes, so my projects mainly stem from them: a Python simulator to recreate the results of a networking paper, a mechanical device for rotating tiny samples in a vacuum chamber (for the EP degree's final-year project), and other small things that recruiters likely wouldn't care about like a dead-simple stepper motor driver.\n\nAs a result, I don't seem to mesh well with most entry-level software development positions. I don't have any web-dev experience, whether front, back, or full-stack (despite the image analysis code being made for a web-app; I just didn't write much non-analysis stuff for the backend codebase, which was mostly Python, Django, and an abuse of ElasticSearch as a database). Embedded and IOT stuff seem interesting to me, but they seem to require hardcore C/C++ experience that I don't have plus a bunch of other weird skills that I've not have encountered before. Cloud and database stuff is also interesting, but they similarly have high requirements that I can't really meet. It seems that all I could really do is data analysis, but I'd much rather be a software developer and not be pigeonholed into just analysis, even with substantial coding involved.\n\nAnd so, I haven't applied to as many places as I should have so far. I've gotten 1 interview, but only because a friend of a friend (/my supervisor for my internship) gave me a referral to a popular local company with Master's level AI people also applying to it. I just don't know what positions I qualify for or should apply to. I don't know how I can convince recruiters and companies that I could easily learn and do embedded, or cloud, or web development with what is largely analysis experience. I don't know how I can spin my mish-mash of experience into a full-time software development position.\n\n(And, for posterity, [my current resume](https://imgur.com/a/TSLvJWt), though critiques are not the point of this post compared to the worries I mentioned above.)",

Felt frustrated during the process as I had many questions I cannot answer that were specific to my problem. My professor suggested I do an MS in CS with a focus on ML. Had to work right after grad because can't afford to enroll myself yet. During my working years, I met a really smart group of people who believed that an MS is a waste of time and money if you wanna work for businesses. These group had lots of connections which brought me lots of part time data science related gigs = $$$. With that money I've saved, I'm planning to study part time(I already applied and got accepted to the best uni that offers this degree in my country and under the ML lab of a great supervisor) and work full time. I can't quit my job because I need to support my family financially.\n\nI think I need more time in school aka MS degree because in my work as a data scientist for a startup, Ive been in situations where I failed to understand what to change in a ready made tool so it will work for my client's specific problem. These are open source tools for deep learning. I don't know if experience alone can fix this under the hood problem.\n\nI also did not understand the material perfectly well in theory classes back in college. I believe a formal training will sharpen my skills in reading ML papers and implement them to code. Plus, I got rejected from a machine learning research scientist position I applied because someone with an MS degree was preferred by the company. \n\nOther than that realization in my limitation of understanding, I don't know other possible motivations to get an MS in CS with ML focus degree. Hoping you could give my some guidance. Thank you. \n\n\n\nP. S\nI'm from a third world country where AI/ML is not yet booming.",

One senior starts talking about something, UX jumps in to point flaws and then it just becomes a back and forth back and forth between these two with others jumping in and cutting each other off to speak and I'm just not like that. Ill politely raise my hand and wait until my manager calls but because these guys keep going back and forth and my manager doesn't shut them up, it gets to the end of the meeting and I either forgot what I wanted to say or no more time and the meeting ends with my opinions and thoughts not expressed. Like there have been times I wanna unmute and just yell \"CAN EVERYONE PLEASE SHUT UP AND LET ME SPEAK!\" but that's obviously unprofessional and I hate cutting people off mid conversation to assert my point. It happened several times and I just feel like nobody gives a shit about what I need to say. The seniors dominate the conversation and UX guy can't just shut the up for a God damn second and keeps pushing back while I sit there politely waiting for my turn. At the beginning I just ignored it and said it's fine but it happened so much that now I just feel like crying and feel useless to the company cause nobody apparently cares about what I want to say. The couple times I have had the chance to express my views regardless how dumb they are, I appreciated just being acknowledged and being told that it's not a good idea or it's a great idea. I'm not always right but I literally just want to be acknowledged and heard when I have something.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. One time some guy from another team was having trouble with something he was working on and it was connected to something I worked on before. I help him troubleshoot and spend my entire day looking beyond our code and into the packages we are using (went beyond our codebase, a deeper rooted issue). Once I found out why, I was excited since it took me the whole damn day. He's much more senior than I am so I was really excited to report to him the problem. Once I did, he was just like \"oh that's wrong it shouldn't be like that\" end of conversation. No thank you, no appreciation for debugging for him, no F'ING NOTHING! I was so deflated cause I literally could have denied to help him but because he's much more senior and has way more experience, I felt rude rejecting his request although I had my own work.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n 3. Manager assigned me a feature that I should work on. I was super excited and he helped give me get started. I start digging into it, researching it, spending my personal time outside work cause I was just that invested. Mid way through, he tells me he will look into it too. He ends up hijacking it and finishing it using some of the work I had done ... Again I felt upset. Why do all that when you were gonna end up working and finishing it. Wtf??? Was I taking too long? Could you have not just directed me to get it done the way you wanted?   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways these are some examples that come to mind and I've gotten to a point where I just drag myself to work. I can't tell if it's valid to feel upset and hurt cause the company has been otherwise treating me well and my manager most of the times is cool and understanding but I can't help understand why I'm so frustrated and upset when I do work. Everyone else in the company seems to be at harmony. Nobody else seems to have trouble with one another. Why do I feel the outlier? Why do I feel so upset and angry at people? I'm so confused .... I cannot reason my emotions. I shouldn't feel this way I have work at a time many people don't and I'm getting paid well but why am I so upset and frustrated with people??",

Initially I thought about getting another 1099 job because I have the bandwidth for it but then I feel like maybe I'm stretching myself too thin and going in the wrong direction. So another thought I had was to go on these sites that offer developers for hire and vet them myself and then turn around and apply for jobs that allow third party applicants. The developer would then be handed over as a consultant to work on the project for the client. There would be no project management on my side. They would simply be a supplemental resource added to a client project. I would build a higher hourly rate and take a cut off the top of it.\n\nWhat am I missing here? This sounds kind of easy especially since I can talk the lingo of tech because I am a developer. It feels like this would scale better than continuing to do 1099 work myself. I'm just not familiar with all of the processes and procedures of subcontracting a 1099 person to another client. it doesn't appear like there is a lot of information online about this from what I have seen.

        "body": "I work at a large firm, and the pay is decent, though about just over half of what my friends make. This is my first job, gonna complete an year next month, right out of university - I did my internship here too. I'm working in a split model, where I offer technical support, and handle tickets for the better part of three days, and then I develop tools to support this team in the remaining two. Most of my active development deals with AngularJS and Java 8/Spring.\n\nI wasn't interested in the support part at all, but I decided to continue with the job because I was afraid of the job market during the pandemic. I have continued to dislike it, but I have learnt how to better manage my time due to it. I also decided to think of it as the \"[eating my own dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)\".\n\nLately, I've gotten extremely frustrated because of the kind of code I'm exposed to. This team completely makes internal products, so we have next to no \"good code\". I have worked with better code than this in my second year of university. It ranges from ridiculous architectural designs, to unit tests that are written purely for the sake of it (think mocks an input and verifies that the input is mocked), and just zero handling of technical debt whatsoever.\n\nI have toyed with the idea of shifting to a different team that does work on consumer-facing products, considering I love the firm I'm at but that seems to be unlikely because our support team is currently in the middle of a resource crunch. What do I do now? Should I consider a new job? Has anyone else been in the same position here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'm also helping out interns who joined us this year. A common thing I've heard from the seniors is that \"its fine if they can't code well, its the easiest part of the job\". This has particularly irked me because I kinda agree with it, but this is clearly where the bad code stems from.",

        "body": "Here's the short version of where I am in a hiring process. Skip to the tldr for the relevant question in bold:\n\nApplied for a job I wasn't qualified for (by accident), surprisingly, they still wanted to interview me. \n\nI did well in the first interview, was asked to do a second one with the team I'd be working with. That also went well. \n\nHad a 15 minute zoom call with the hiring manager (from the first interview), he wants to hire me, but (as described above) I'm not qualified for the position I applied for, but he wants to hire me for a position that's being created currently (already submitted to hr, they're doing approval before its posted). Told me it SHOULD take 1-2 weeks, but knowing hr, make that a month. \n\nHe told me I might consider doing a temp position in the mean time, but only if Hr could guarantee a smooth transition to the full time position. After about a week, hr could not give him the assurances he wanted, so he took the temp thing off the table and said we'd wait for the full time position.\n\nGot an update friday, they're negotiating the salary with hr now. Got another update this morning: position passed the first step of the approval process, he expects the job to (hopefully) \"post\" this week. He'll then move my application to that newly created position where he'll then tell hr he wants to hire me for that position. \n\n**I then asked what step comes next. He said hr will do their vetting of me, then they'll formally extend me the offer. He said the vetting will be normal stuff like checking references and my education. I have the bachelor's degree in computer science that is required for this entry level position, but I'm worried about my gpa. While i didn't see anything about gpa requirements, my college gpa was pretty shit (under a 3.0) because I switched majors yata yata yata. I've heard from a friend who's a software engineer at an insurance company, that she's had people get hired by the hiring manager, and then upon hr reviewing their application, denied the hire because of their gpa. I don't know how typical that is though. Couple questions then. First, how common is it for people to check your gpa (rather than just verify that you do in fact possess the required degree). Of the 4-5 places i've gotten interviews with the last year (fuck covid man, so many places are in a hiring freeze, if not outright laying people off), only one has requested my transcripts. Obviously I didn't get that job. And my second question, how common is it for places to then reject you if your gpa isn't above a certain threshold? I mean its not like its beneath a 2.0 or anything. its just not above 3.0. If i were to just give them my gpa for the last 2.5 years (5 semester) when i formally switched majors to computer science, my gpa is a 3.06. I think that's a lot more relevant to my skills than to look at my long gpa history when I was in a completely unrelated major.**\n\ndon't sugar coat it for me. This is the first time since i graduated last may that a company was actually interested in hiring me. Its a large university hiring for biomedical research they do. I'd hate to finally have a tentative offer only to have hr give the thumbs down. If my hiring manager (whom i've built a rapport with) is emphatic enough, could he sway them? \n\nThanks as always guys",

        "body": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am graduating from a Computer Science degree in 2023. I have been fortunate enough to work a summer internship as a full-stack developer utilizing React and Node.JS (typescript for both) as well as a year long internship working as a system developer using Java (no frameworks AFAIK). I also have a lot of AI experience through clubs using Python but I am not really a big fan of working with ML/AI, still worth mentioning since I believe Django has a decent market share for backend.\n\nI am trying to make myself as attractive a candidate as possible through bolstering my personal portfolio. I have two projects on it thus far, both of which have used React and Node.JS. I am hoping to have a couple more full stack side projects by the time I graduate, on top of having my AWS certifications and enhancing my side projects with their services. \n\nI was wondering if you guys think it would be worth creating projects in C#/Java since currently I am hoping to work primarily in backend as this is the field I have found most compelling so far. Those two languages obviously dominate the backend job market currently but it seems like overkill to use these for projects that aren't of enterprise scale, in addition to having a higher learning curve than other languages and frameworks. I really like working with Node.JS and am quite comfortable throwing servers together with Express. I also have demonstrable work experience with Java thanks to my current internship even though it is not in a traditional web development setting. Ultimately, do you guys think it would be worth it to teach myself Java or C# for the backend of future side projects or would it be better to gain more experience with Node.JS? If so, should I bolster my Java knowledge or jump into C# which seems to be a much more developer friendly experience? Job market seems evenly split in my area.\n\nTL;DR, upcoming CS graduate can't decide if I should continue making side projects with Node.JS or branch off and learn Java/C# to prepare me for enterprise jobs",

I have a background in Mechanical Engineering, so I've been in the engineering world for about 7 years.  I've also done a lot of facilitation in my personal life outside of work - personal growth type things.\n\nWell, until now one of our Sr SWE's has been doubling as our SCRUM master (he also trained SCRUM masters before coming onboard with us). He just got promoted to Director of SW, and he asked me if I'd be interested to be the SCRUM facilitator for my team, because he's noticed my facilitation skills and thinks I'd be good at it.  I know SCRUM master is often a full-time job, but he said he doesn't expect me to do much more than go to the same meetings I'm going to now, like retro, standup, etc.  This is what he's been doing in the same position, so I believe him.\n\nIf I say yes, it'll come with a pay bump, although he hasn't given me a number yet. I'd also get to go to a SCRUM master training course, and I have no doubt he'd be very supportive.  I've been filling in for him from time to time, and I enjoy it.\n\nMy main goal is to grow my SW career, and this seems like it could be a good way to develop soft skills that will benefit me there. But I wouldn't want it to pull me away or detract from my primary focus of software engineering. I do, however, see how they could be complementary.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

        "body": "I don't know how to say it, I go to UBC (top 3 cs/ce school in Canada) Computer Engineering, have almost perfect major GPA (4.0 major, 3.3 cgpa, rough Canadian GPA to us gpa conversion, Dean's honor list, and according to my advisor I would be top 5% of my faculty this year based on my academic performance this semester), have 1 year of coop work experience in web and mobile app dev, have projects, and yet here I am, not securing anything. For my second coop work term (Jan 2019), I only had 4 months of work experience, did like 50 applications, got 7-8 interviews and multiple offers. Now with that coop work term experience, I did almost 500 applications, over 10-12 interviews and no offer so far. I have done a lot of mock interviews, did 130 leetcode problems, had referrals, and had really good interviews but it seems like it is almost impossible to get an internship now. My friends who work at FAANG and with whom I practiced Mock, told me that the best way to approach a problem is to give them a suboptimal solution, then work with your interviewer to give an optimal solution, and even if you can't, if you share your thought process, they will take you in (one of my friend couldn't solve a faang problem but talked out his thought process and got the job at that same company). Seems like it is no longer the case. Interviewers want an optimal solution at the first try, and if I work with them, I just get rejected. I recently had an interview with SAP where they gave me 2 problems, i gave them optimal for the one and suboptimal for the second one and my interviewer told me I did really well, and I was really good at communicating my thought process, yet I got rejected.\n\nI really am feeling extremely burnt out and tired. if this is the norm, how can I even break into the industry? My high gpa that I worked really hard for, my interview prep that I spent hours after hours with my friends, spending time on my resume, countless mock interviews with coop office, paid service and with my friends, all are just going to waste. I am not only tired and concerned that maybe I should not be in the field in the first place. My other engineering friends even in this job market didn't have to go through that many interviews, and some coop programs (especially civil, mining and geotechnical) have almost 100% placement rate (meaning almost everyone who was in the coop program secured a work term this summer)\n\nI don't know, I chose software engineering because I really loved making small web and mobile apps, and always wanted to know how video games work, but it is really burning me out right now with all this interview prep and the disappointment I am getting after getting rejected even though I felt I did really well. It's endless cycle of rejections. I really want some advice as to what should I be doing next? Switching to some other engineering field? Go to grad school? Just give up? I am also really concerned as to whether I even have a chance to break into the career if this is the stage of internship interview, then new grad is almost next to impossible.\n\nAlso just to clarify, I am applying to everything, not just big name companies. Most of them are local with a few in other Canadian provinces and a few to US companies. \n\nThanks",

I currently make $55k in a MCOL area.\n\nI found this contract to hire job but something seems amiss here. The job is in NJ. It states that it's a 12-month contract to hire job with $25 per hour followed by a $70k salary upon conversion. This job is for a junior engineer. \n\n$25 per hour gives you approx. $50k and that's before taxes. \n\nWhy is the contractor phase paying lower than the full-time salary? I am just wondering where the beef is here, because this seems like very downgraded contractor pay. \n\nYou have to get paid more as a contractor compared to the FT person doing the same work. At least it should, from my knowledge. I don't understand where the advantage of being paid less as a contractor happens, unless there's something else I'm not aware about these jobs as choices for developers.",

        "body": "I got fired from a startup in just under 2 months. To be honest I'm relieved. I think I got put on a performance improvement plan on my third week, and the feedback I got from my manager didn't always make sense. I didn't have framework experience although my manager thought he heard I did in the interview, so my output was low while I was learning things and this was brought up on week 3. Not sure if framework experience was a hiring requirement but it seems most devs they hire have it. I started working harder and my performance improved, yet I was told \"I don't think you understand what's happening at the company\" after I crushed a sprint they claimed I wasn't expected to finish. I asked for very little help during this sprint which is why I'm confused he'd bring up my understanding. When performance wasn't an issue they brought up miscommunications (which had almost no impact) without commending my performance improvement, and on my first slow week after improving they fired me lol. I'm pretty sure my manager made up his mind on week 3.\n\nMoving forward, do you think I should bother including this job on my resume at all? I took a year-long personal break from my career prior to joining this company, so I'm both anxious to fill that gap but not so worried about an extra 2 months off. I don't know if 2 months of experience outweighs the negatives of being fired in the eyes of recruiters and interviewers.\n\nTo be honest I've had performance issues after a year at a big tech company before this, but I've been working through what I think my problems are and I think I still belong as a dev, even if at a non IT company.",

        "body": "Hi all, thanks for reading and helping me out. I've been at Microsoft  for 2.5 years as a PM for a couple teams. I've been working here since graduation and have an EE degree with a minor in CS. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to code or do many 'technical' projects while on these teams and don't have any internship experience, so I'm considering myself as having 'zero-experience' although that's not completely true. I would like to switch roles to software engineering as I think this position better aligns with my interests and provides an opportunity to gain more useful and tangible skills. I have a couple questions I hope folks could help me with:\n\n1. [I saw this older post from the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6e0dm4/are_remote_entry_level_positions_rare/) about finding entry level remote positions, and how rare it is. Now that we've been working from home for the last year I imagine (or hope) that there would be more opportunities for entry level remote work? If that's the case, any advice on where to look? If not remote, what would be the best listings to find entry-level positions?\n2. It will be easiest for me to pivot internally but am interested in exploring other companies. I'm not sure if being at Microsoft is a better help considering my role but, is there anything you think I could do to better my chances of switching companies (beyond \"doing side projects\")?\n3. I'm currently going through CTCI and attempting a couple LeetCode problems a day (studying Java). My coding experience is limited to Java and C which I studied in school. I know that lots of companies use more modern languages such as React, TypeScript, etc. Is it necessary for me to learn these to standout as 'relevant' (such as taking a bootcamp course, or doing a side project in these languages)?  I know \"anything helps\" but 'm trying to optimize my studying since I have a full-time job.\n\nI may need some help deciding on whether to pivot companies or try to move internally (and then pivot) but would like to start here. Thanks for reading and any advice",

I've been doing work in my internships related to that as well as doing research and taking classes about the concepts in the field.\n\nHowever, I recently had a meeting with an advisor (a well-respected CS prof at my uni) who claimed that data science is like cookie cutter coding... you just use code that's already been written and mold it to fit your problem (his sister is a data scientist at Facebook). I don't know how much of this is true, but it really turned me off to the idea of a career in data science and now I'm feeling a little lost as to what I want to do.\n\nI was drawn to the field because of the possibility of working with the cutting edge, solving new and unique problems, and doing super cool work. I've enjoyed the projects I've been able to work on so far, but I know there's still so much of the industry I have yet to see.\n\n**Can anyone tell me more about what it's like doing data science work in industry?

        "body": "When I graduated with my bachelor's in Computer Science, I really wanted to go on a data science path, deciding to start as a Data Analyst and later go back for my masters to try to be a Data Scientist. For reasons I don't want to get into, I decided that's not the path I want to take, I want to just do programming full-time. I do a little bit of SQL and Python at work, but not enough to satisfy me, or tell interviewers that I did proper software development in those languages, mostly bug fixes and scripting.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't have any real internships, I just volunteered on-and-off for about a year and a half on a website my friend made, it was C#, MS SQL, and Bootstrap. I wrote maybe like 10 web pages of varying complexity, with a lot of guidance from my friend. My friend stopped doing the website several months ago and I can't really carry it on, I don't have the permission or expertise, as he pretty much told me what to write and only I understood some (but not all) of it, though towards the end I was getting more independent. \n\nThe C# stack my friend used is pretty old, I really don't see many jobs requiring any of the front-end stuff we used; it's all react/angular and typescript/javascript now from what I'm seeing. In the few technical interviews I've made it to, they're surprised/disappointed I don't know REST, MVC, or Javascript. The jobs I'm applying for I can usually do fine in the interviews and pass the (easy) coding assessment, I just don't think I tick the boxes for recruiters or hiring managers because my stack isn't really common anymore.\n\nAs all my C# experience sorta ended several months ago, I'm really rusty on remembering how certain things worked and my friend really isn't available to help me with that stuff. Unfortunately for me, this seems like the best life line I have on my resume to hop over to software development.\n\nAre there any options I have other than just spending all my free time forcing myself to learn javascript/typescript/angular/rest, or will the right opportunity come along eventually? I don't really care if I'm front-end or back-end, I just want a job and obviously the least amount of extra work I have to do after working 40+ hours a week would be nice. Are there other things I should prioritize learning instead? And just as a note, I'm not trying to get into a FAANG here, just any old job would be cool.\n\n**tl;dr - Only real experience other than my cs degree was some volunteering on a website where I was guided through everything by a more senior dev. The site used an older stack that didn't use javascript/typescript/react/angular/REST/etc. so I was wondering if I had to learn those to get an entry-level job. What do I need to do?**",

Now then, this offer expires in a few days, so I would have to make the choice pretty fast.\n\nThe issue is I recently got in contact with someone at General Motors, who I have heard a lot less negative things about on this reddit. My interviews with them would start past the date of accepting the offer from Cognizant, and I'm not guaranteed to get a job with them after I go through these interviews. But again, I have heard less negative things about them compared to Cognizant.\n\nBoth of their start dates are in June, and are fairly close in what times they will reopen and I will have to relocate to where they want me to work at.

I'm tired of seeing all of these junior devs/people new to the industry pressing others that leetcode is the only 100% absolute way to score a job. Stop doing that. You people are working yourselves and others up over something that doesn't actually matter.\n\nI've been in the industry for 10 years now. I don't have a college degree and I never went to a bootcamp. I've had about 6 jobs in the industry so far. I've been everything from a junior dev, to a mid dev, to a senior dev, to a team lead. I've worked for small mom and pop companies and I've worked for F500 companies. I've never used leetcode before. I've never been asked about it and I've never actually talked to another experienced dev who expects juniors to grind it all day long. \n\nI've hired a ton of juniors and interns and not once have I ever cared about whether or not they're grinding leetcode or asked a question regarding it. What I do care about when hiring people is their personality and their ability to solve **actual** problems that actual businesses have gone through.\n\nMy point is, leetcode isn't the end all be all to getting a job in the industry. 90% of companies could not care less about it. Focus more on being an easy person to work with and work on actual interesting personal projects and I guarantee you'll get a job faster than someone who's spending 100% of their time doing problems on leetcode that they'll never have to use in the real world.",

Currently, I have no plans to relocate after graduating (I'm in the St. Louis area), and I'm still not 100% what area of development I want to specialize in.  I kind of thrive on dabbling in a little bit of everything and love being a generalist.  The idea of working for a consulting company and working on a new project every few months seems incredibly exciting to me.  I see Accenture pretty well regarded and it SEEMS like a company I'd love to gun for closer to graduation but I was hoping some people in here might have some insight or suggestions.",

        "body": "Hi! I'm 19yrs old and a 2nd year Human Resouces student rn, and started to code a couple of months back out of boredom, I'm really enjoying everything I learned and the idea of having my own proyects and being able to code it myself seems really interesting, but the truth is I dont want to start from 0 and spend another 5/6 years in a cs degree, would you recommend it anyways? Is it worth it if my aim is mainly to program? I've heard about bootcamps and maybe that's a good option too, but maybe not enough to get a junior position afterwards. Idk if anyone has some advice I'm all ears. Thank you!\n\nEdit: ok guys you help me to finally make a decision, I forgot to mention I'm not from the states so the school system here works differently, but although I'm starting from zero, this august beggins my engineering degree, thank u all and hopefully I can come back to this forum later and comment to help others change carrers, thx!",

        "body": "Before covid (Summer 2019?) I had posted this:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dflwh8/salary_negotiation_question/\n\nSo after I posted this I was pretty persistent about my promotion with my manager.  Because I was designing the system rewrite from the ground up, I believed I satisfied the SWE III requirements.\n\nMy manager didn't really agree, which was really disappointing, and he seemed to be ambivalent about the whole situation.  He didn't understand that my promotion had to be put in before a certain date and missed it.  This was January 2020.\n\nAt that point I escalated it two levels up and had a one on one with the manager of all software engineering for my company.  He was definitely more receptive but was also trying to make the point that I was \"silo'ed\" and needed to do more stuff to get my work noticed.\n\nCoincidentally a month later we had a huge project come in with an incredibly aggressive timeline.  I was able to shift gears quickly and help complete the project, being a fundamental part of it.  This brought us up into March of 2020. \n\nThen COVID hit and I was told that I was SOL and come back in 3-6 months.  That sucked a lot especially since I had busted my ass for a huge company win.  I basically went on cruise control for the next several months, and kept inquiring about my promotion once the 3 month mark had passed.  I started looking for new employment during the summer, just passively and when I had time.  I had probably a dozen interviews over the past year to varying levels of success, some I got really close to closing.\n\nMy manager kept checking and the answer was always no.  As fall and winter rolled around I started nagging more about it.  It was pretty rough, on one end you have corporate saying \"there is no hiring freeze\" but then your manager saying \"all adjustments are on hold.\"  \n\nI had to sit through multiple town halls where they paraded marquees of all the people who did get promotions.  It felt like everyone was getting a promotion BUT ME.  At this point my manager had done a complete 180 and was pretty angry I had been neglected.  During my 2020 performance review I got the highest possible rating.\n\nDespite all this, the corp still tried to say no to my promotion.  This brings us to March 2021.  Upon hearing their refusal again I got more aggressive with my job search.  There were some murmurings that my promotion was going through but it was still taking forever and I was given no ETA.\n\nAfter taking a hackerrank from a company and probably getting what I would consider a C- to D+ on it (finished 4/5 of the problems, most without all test cases fulfilled) I was able to secure an offer of 85k.  I told my employer I was going to leave if they weren't able to get my promotion and more than the offer by Friday.\n\nI was contacted the next day by the manager of software engineering and asked for my range, which I said was 90-100.  He offered me my promotion and 80 on the spot which I turned down, and was confused by.  Pretty much said give me 90-100 or I'm walking.\n\n24 hours later I had secured the promotion to level 3 and a new salary of 90k a year.  It's amazing how fast these things can turn around when you threaten to walk.  I'm pretty happy now, and I didn't want to leave the company I work for because it has great perks and an awesome work life balance.\n\nThanks for reading!",

I have 2-3 solid references and a \"chat\" with a hiring manager this afternoon.\n\nWould you take higher pay with a **contractor (currently looking at \\~$80k salary or more, in slightly higher CoL)** or stay in the more secure position with the **government for less pay ($60k salary, to be \\~$67k in two years, roughly 15% lower CoL)** and benefits? The position is the same, DevOps Engineer. I'm 22, I have no children & I am renting where I live.\n\nI would like to work for the big boys eventually but I am currently not good enough at Leetcode-style questions to pass the interviews. In the meantime, I'm chasing salary. Another motivating factor is that if I stay with the government I am likely to end up in a Program Manager type position where I'm not really touching code, probably 3-5 years from now, which I do not want as it would no doubt pigeonhole my career into staying with the government.\n\nEdit: Added details/context.",

I did everything as good as I could and people were impressed, but they did not take me because they said that the project had no future, since it was too different.\nFirst job: was hired as a ML developer in the testing department and was the only Machine Learning developer in the firm. Never had a mentor and was put in the position to talk directly to clients. No code review, no guidance, they just asked for solutions. And the pay was terrible (even though the company is big). After 3 years and 3 solo projects + extracurricular activities (mentorship, student contest organising and promoting company and jobs) I left because they refused to pay me more than a junior.\nNow: changed my job but since I'm doing almost the same things I find it hard not to think that this will end the same and that people don't care.

After the summer, I was offered the opportunity to co-op part-time while finishing up my last year of school. I graduate in just a couple of weeks now.\n* In February, I asked my boss about a potential full-time position after I graduate. After some back and forth, he basically said that quarterly results would depend on whether or not a position would be available. However, I would be given the option to extend my co-op until August to see if any more positions open up then.\n* In April, I bring up the question again. He says that at the moment he can't tell me anything. \n* Yesterday I asked him if my next steps at this company were to continue the co-op or if any positions have opened since I graduate soon. I have not gotten a response as of the writing of this post.\n\nWhile I understand that the bottom line ultimately affects the availability of positions, this company has also been hiring for similar positions while I've been co-op'ing for them, so I find the 'quarterly results' reasoning to be a bit questionable.\n\nThat being said, I can tell that my boss has definitely made an attempt to get me a full-time position since he has generally been impressed with my work. I have a feeling that he couldn't tell me anything in April because he was in the middle of discussing it with the company.\n\nAs for the lack of response from yesterday's email, I think it's most likely because he thinks that I'm going to leave if he tells me there isn't a position now. \n\nI haven't had trouble landing interviews, and I know that it's only a matter of time before I land a position somewhere.

Should I bring into account the future salary that I've been meaning to ask in about 4 months now? As it seems quite odd to get a raise now and ask for another in 4 months..\n2. 10% raise is what I've been meaning to ask for as a senior developer.

        "body": "I currently work for a very large global company that offers good benefits and a 50k annual salary, but I just got offered an internship with the Disney College Program which lasts about 6 months. I graduated a year ago in May 2020 and getting to for a famous entertainment/tech company seems like a dream come true. This internship pays me 1/3rd less than what I\u2019m being paid right now. Here are some thoughts I had about this scenario: \n\nIf I leave my current company and go for Disney, I\u2019m going for something... \n\n1. I have a chance for something that seems like a lifetime! It\u2019s like you rather go for something and say you did it rather than regretting later that you should have done it \ud83d\ude2d \n2. My dream company is Disney \n3. It might open opportunities for me because I work for Disney at a certain period \n4. And I\u2019m looking for a job now anyway trying to get out of my current job! \n5. It\u2019s 6 months and the job isn\u2019t secure \n\nIf I decline the offer from Disney,\n\n1. I don\u2019t like my job that I\u2019m currently at and I\u2019ll keep thinking about declining that offer I had from my dream company that I had a chance to! \n2. I have a full time job now vs 6 months at Disney.\n3. My associates I work with now are amazing which I can make new friends at Disney so I\u2019m not too worried about that. \n4. The pay is way more here than in Disney \n5. Can work and still make money while looking for a new job rather than a deadline if I were at Disney \n\nI am so excited about this opportunity but the thought of leaving my current full time job for \u201cjust a 6 month internship\u201d, which makes me so overwhelmed! \n\nI started this job last December 2020, and my internship begins in August 2021! I had an internship with Disney back in August 2020 but it got canceled due to COVID - 19.  I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m risking for something that isn\u2019t secure when I have something already secured. And I know my parents wouldn\u2019t be too happy with that as well. I want to ask for time off but 6 months seems like a lot of time. \n\nI\u2019m 23 and I live with my parents. I\u2019m saving a lot of money now but my current job requires a lot of relocation in the future for higher positions. The situation at home is getting unbearable which is why I\u2019m always out all the time until I have to come home.\n\nSo it really feels like I\u2019d be wasting this opportunity if I I don\u2019t take it. And this internship is a big change for me where I feel like I can\u2019t say no. But I feel like if I leave my full time position for something that\u2019s temporary - I would feel very uptight about it. \n\nI\u2019m afraid I may be making a huge mistake for my future and feel so indecisive as to the pathway I should take. If someone has some good advice, I would love to hear it and would greatly appreciate your input!",

I developed a web app that manages a very detailed database of soccer match data and wanted to share/market what I've built to help me land my next job, so I was wondering the best way to share this project.  It's not really possible to deploy the project since the app is for manipulating a database (running scrape jobs, resolving data anomalies, etc.) not for an end-user, so I think its more appropriate to demonstrate the functionality in an article or video format.\n\nGiven this, I was considering various options like\n\n* Publishing a LinkedIn article\n* Making a YouTube video and sharing in professional networks\n* Creating a \"showcase\" website that demonstrates functionality. (Perhaps just a page in a personal website?)\n\nBut I wasn't necessarily satisfied with any of these options, because most of these networks have a high volume of posts and I'm not sure something that's not flashy would get much traction.\n\nIf any one has any suggestions or any personal experience marketing their projects it would be extremely helpful!",

It's a big company most of you have heard of, but I'll keep their name quiet.\n\nMy expectations for this internship were to maybe debug some code, write small scripts (I work for an automation team), and do small things to start. I wrote maybe half of a working script before I got assigned a major project. \n\nWhile I'm grateful for the experience this gives me, I still feel like maybe I was overworked? Overestimated? I'm to build a web app from front-to-back, that helps us automate some internal workflows. I was assigned this entirely to myself, the intern, and had freedom to choose the tech stack. I was given some repos and libraries to reference, as they were similar/needed to what I was tasked to build. Then, off I go to build an entire web app.\n\nI was interviewed for Python automation, but now I'm building a fullstack web app from scratch. I'm spending most of my time writing React code, which I had 0 knowledge of going into this. I was hoping for more Python work, as I would like to go into Data Science in the future, and Python is heavily needed for that, but I'm stuck writing JavaScript.\n\nTo be fair, I have learned a ton. Enough to produce a pretty usable app, but there's a lot of fault and bugs that I'm sure are due to my lack of experience. I'm constantly rewriting my code, my manager doesn't look over my code too often, and I'm kinda just this free-roaming fullstack web developer with little guidance. My mentor isn't too available, and remote work make this whole internship a hell of a lot harder.\n\nIs any of this normal? Is this just my imposter syndrome?

Full Stack/Web Dev - Good with front end (just, good); okay with backend, need to be a lot better; can learn database, it's been more that 2 years since I typed a query\n\n2. iOS - Only learning a little but of Swift, still not good, but will be soon\n\n3. ML/AI - decent exposure through a research project (yet to be published), however, it doesn't interest me as much as the previous two\n\nI'd say it's almost a tie between 1 and 2\n\nNow, coming to the long route; let's say I'm not able to move to a Dev role at my present company after a year, for whatever reason. What should my next plan be? How can I move to a Dev role, from a support role.\n\nAnd if anyone can give me tips on how to learn, or what to learn to be good at the mentioned fields, please do help me out\n\nCheers :)",

        "body": "TLDR; husband is depressed and overwhelmed and stopped working again. But we are in debt for his startup. What can I do?\n\n\\---\n\nMy husband has been doing startups for over 8 years. He has been as an executive within several startup companies in the first few years, then he started to do his own startups one after another. He failed at most of it. One of them is however still alive but he got a fight with his former partner so he left that company.\n\nLast year he got really depressed and not working for half of year. This year, he got another idea and found another guy who he found really happy to work with as business partners so they started a new company. He was super excited and felt happy again. He's been meeting people for several months and I would say he's actually doing very well at impressing people. But recently he started to be depressed again. I think he tends to get tired or overwhelmed by the things he doesn't like to do (exp, real management work, financial, etc), and he keeps having new ideas he wants to do and gets distracted. Also he borrowed some money so I think he's also very anxious about finance. Anyway, recently since he's depressed, he basically stopped working, instead, he watches TV and playing video games most of the time.\n\nI don't know what to do. I tried to cheer him up or ignore his emotions and just focusing my own stuffs, but it didn't help. I tried to talk to him a long time ago (this kind of situation is not the first time, it happens to him a lot) and he just got more depressed or angry, or he went to work the rest of that day but return to play games the next day...I wasn't anxious when he borrowed the money, because I thought it's normal in the beginning phase, but now I am really worried. One day, he said he wanted to go to restaurants, but I said we are in debts so we should save any little pennies. But he disagreed and still went out.\n\nI'm not just worrying about finance, I'm more worried about him. With his serial entrepreneurship history, I think a lot of companies will avoid hiring him if someday he wants to go back to be an employee. Also because he was either CTO or CEO, so a lot of senior developer positions will just overlook him. The last reason I'm worried is because, it looks like if he fails this time or abandons it again, he will think his life is completely over and it will be very hard for him to get back to his feet again.",

I would have to do 2 more years paying tuition and wasting time or I could do what I enjoy doing and live the life that I want. I\u2019m asking for advice because my friends aren\u2019t that helpful and I\u2019m getting mixed opinions, because if I drop out then I might regret not getting a degree and that I\u2019m still young, and if I stay I\u2019m just wasting my time.\n\nThis is a big decision so I would just like to see what you guys would do in my situation, also I feel like my parents would not be cool with me dropping out. \n\nTL;DR: Don\u2019t wanna do CS full-time after Uni and I already have businesses started up and creating really good income, is it worth to stay and just finish the degree?",

Ultimately I'd like to spend most of my time practicing meditation and creating music.\n\nAccordingly I don't like the idea of working a fulltime job. Rather I'd like to be self-employed and work 4-5 focused hours every day of the year. I'm willing to live frugally and remain single for the time being. I'm disciplined and have blocked any distractions out of my life. It's not that I'm lazy and don't want to work, it's just that my priorities are Buddhism and to a lesser extend music.\n\nLast year I decided to learn fullstack development and have so far acquired the following skills:\n\n* HTML, CSS, JS, Tailwind\n* React, Redux, React Native\n* NodeJS + Express + MongoDB\n* Passport + other auth stuff\n\nMy plan is to start by continually publishing web and mobile apps, especially apps which I would use myself as a musician. I do have a couple of ideas which don't yet exist on the market. I think these might possibly become another stream of passive income, in case people actually start using them. In case nobody starts using them I hope to have a pretty good portfolio, thus being somewhat employable.\n\nWorking part-time is something I could definitely see myself doing, but I don't know how realistic getting such a position is.\n\nFreelancing is another avenue which I'd like to pursue both as a fullstack developer and a musician. \n\nI'd highly appreciate any advice on how to approach all of this.\n\nMay you be happy :)",

During team selection, I interviewed with the Team B manager who said they have a lot of funding and they can keep me long term if I wanted to stay.

The hiring manager from Team A calls me and says I am able to move over to their team. Great! I thought- Then... they state I have 2 options move to the embedded test team or lab operations team for couple months of training then transition to the embedded development team. Both test and lab teams dont interest me (sounds like combination of SDET and devops but not really) and I am losing hope in those roles. Also the tech stack and process isnt as modern for the embedded team compared to the full stack team.\n\nI have a meeting with my hiring manager from Team A this week. I plan to let them know I want to stay with the dev team. My only concern is promotions. The dev team is remote for me while the others are in the bay area or east coast. Without an on-site manager in my area I feel like this will be an uphill battle for promotions. At any rate if I go to embedded team I will likely leave as Im no longer interested in that career path.

        "body": "Hi all. A little background about me... I graduated from a MS in Math last May. I have extensive coursework in math/stats/CS/ML, did a computation-heavy thesis (simulations in Python, not ML) which led to a publication as first author, and taught undergrad calculus. My university was a no-name state university in a rural area with few connections to tech and I don't have much of a network. I have no industry experience/internships -- I intended to do a PhD but realized it wasn't for me.\n\nDue to health issues I've been taking time off after graduating. I've sharpened my technical skills and completed a few projects in the last few months and have started applying for jobs. I think my background and interests are most suited to a DS role; however, these roles seem to be highly contested by PhDs and people with several YoE. My math background should put me ahead of many candidates (e.g. non-quantitative BS + MSDS), but I feel my lack of a PhD or previous experience prevents me from being a strong candidate. Also, because of how poorly-defined DS roles are, I get the sense a lot of companies don't know what they're looking for, and the interviews can test you on anything.\n\nI've heard that starting as a analyst or SWE is a better route into DS/ML. I'm not really interested in the dashboarding and SQL duties that an analyst role entails. I've learned some web dev skills (Django, JS/React, etc.) to deploy ML models and think a SWE (web dev) role could be fitting. I'd have to practice LC like hell, though.\n\n**Given my background should I apply to DS or SWE positions to optimize my chance of landing a job?** I'm more aligned with DS, but it is insanely competitive at entry level, and my callback rate has been low. Alternatively, I have *some* SWE skills and the barrier to entry is lower.",

However, I hated my job so much that I'm switching to backend now.\n\nThe thing is, while doing your own frontend portfolio projects you are developer, client and designer all at the same time. That means you can get as creative as you want. You want a website with a poop emoji as cursor? You can do it. Nobody dictates how something should look, act or behave. You are completely free. Kinda like an artist.\n\nHowever, working as frontend developer felt like the exact opposite. Your only task is to translate the ideas of your designer and his clients into code. Your website has to be a perfect copy of a template somebody else has made. It's was depressing and I simply couldn't stand it anymore.  Maybe it sounds a bit arrogant, but I'm not a google translator where you can input a design and who translates it into code and then displays the result in the browser.\n\nHow do you feel about it and what are your experiences?",

        "body": "Hi! First time posting here. I'm a junior dev with high expectations for my career. My current goals are to cover the gaps of my knowledge and experience regarding software development: containers, containers management, DevOps, get solid on cloud computing, etc. Besides, I want to become a software architecture / software engineer, knowing how to plan and execute projects from end-to-end. \n\nThat said, I received an offer to work at a company paying me 50% more than what I receive today. The technical interviewer said I'd be working with Java, Spring, Docker, Kubernetes and Mendix (low-code). Regarding Java and Spring, okay that seems pretty regular stuff. Docker and Kubernetes are techs I want to learn, yay! What I'd dread, though, would be to work with visual coding, drag and drop kind of things, and that's what I fear about Mendix / low-code. I don't know much about it and neither about what's the extent of it in the project.\n\nWhat you guys think? What do you know about Mendix? I'm somewhat insecure, but my current job is not great either as I'm using a visual platform for developing chatbots. The only good part is doing Lambda integrations in AWS and using DynamoDB a little here and there, but not great by any stretch.\n\nCheers!",

Since then I\u2019ve at 2 different banks. One as a teller and another in the call center and some landscaping work. I just want something more for myself and I don\u2019t want my age to be a factor as to yeah I should have this and that figured out, etc. \n\nI started school at my local community college in the fall of 2019, I finished up my last 2 gen Ed\u2019s, college algebra and csc 111. The following spring I took precalc 1 and csc 112 and ended up failing those classes because the pandemic started and zoom classes just wasn\u2019t doing it for me (yes I know that\u2019s a bad excuse and I should of passed). So fast forward to now, I will be taking precalc 1 & 2 this summer.\n\nMy goal is to take all the lower level CS classes at my community college and transfer them back to the university I first attended. At that point I will have to finish my upper level courses, electives and another math class (calc 2 I think it is).\n\nAt my community college, I have 7 classes left to take:\nComputer science 2\nDatabase management systems \nData structures and algorithms \nDiscrete mathematics \nCalc 1  \nPrecalc 1 & 2\n\nAll the classes above except precalc 1 & 2 are transferable to university.\n\nOkay so I guess that\u2019s a lot of background info...but my question is it worth going back to school at this age? I would like to be a software engineer. A lot of ppl have counted me out unfortunately. I want to prove them wrong as well as prove to myself I can do this. Also Idk if information science & technology could be an option as well because the CS math courses are kinda scary and I\u2019m not a math wiz or anything. IS&T and CS at the university I plan to attend have the same lower level courses. \n\nOkay I\u2019m done rambling. Thank you",

It has some projects included in the course and I was also thinking of making a couple of personal projects afterwards as well to help if necessary. If that\u2019s not enough, what should I look at for next steps? \n\nI\u2019m also wondering what field in software development I might fit best in - I really enjoyed the problem solving aspect in the course I took (it was mainly implementing data structures and algorithms from scratch), but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not what jobs are actually like. From my limited knowledge, I think something back-end or data science would be more technical and might suit me better, but I\u2019d love some opinions from people more knowledgeable.

When I do get stuck, they can't help and Im just left furiously Googling the answer to things which has been working out okay so far. He asked me to read a paper on a particular algorithm and after I made a presentation on it I had some questions like in what instance would you use this over traditional CNNs and he couldn't even answer. \n\nThe internship is a year long so it's not a suck it up and get it over with type situation, and I'm currently not in a position to be able to leave the internship.

He keeps pushing me to work on this platform when he is of no help at all (his idea of helping is asking me for a design change when I hardly know what I'm doing) and is deviating from the internship agreement where I was supposed to be learning ml. I did try to express my unhappiness (quite poorly, I must admit) but nothing has changed. Also to note this a research team, and my internship allowance is paid for by another entity and not the company itself. I'm not an employee there.\n\nEdit: it was the 12th week into the internship that I had my first taste of ml, but was subsequently told to get right back to developing the platform. Also it's just strange that they are asking me to build the platform even before the ml model has been developed when the platform is supposed to be fore the model (I'm guessing it has something to do with my supervisors deliverables that's why he's pushing me to do it).",

        "body": "English is not my native language. Please excuse any grammatical errors.\n\nI have roughly 1 year of experience with node.js development. I primarily worked with NoSQL databases like MongoDB and DynamoDB and I know a bit of docker and basic ci/cd integration as well. I was wondering if I should dive deeper into being a backend dev should I focus on node and learn more of its frameworks (meteor, sails, koa, etc.) Or should I know know multiple backend languages or should I learn react or any other FE framework and become a fullstack dev? Which career path has a better future outlook? \n\nI know that as long as I'm good in my field I'll do great and all that. I'm concerned about this because I'll start school this September in Canada and I am from a south Asian country so I am not very familiar with the western job market situation and I have seen a lot of people applying to 100s of jobs over months and hardly getting any interviews so this has somewhat added to my anxiety.\n\nThank you for any and all suggestions.",

I'm the guy trynna make sure the supply meets demand however, I want to switch over to CS because I don't like the location and I am decent at coding.\n2. With my background I didn't know which direction to go through so I went on free code camp and just went the web dev route. Thought why not.\n3. I want to leverage my previous technical experience so I was wondering if you all wanted to help me find my place in the Computer Science world. I already know python due to using for research before. However, the data science route seemed to be the most stringent on degrees and certifications. That's why I started to pick up web dev. Seemed the most fluid and I can knock out javascript and a couple projects by the end of the year.\n4. My only caveat with not leverging my current resume is that I do have a salary requirement. I am right now helping my family out and paying for their bills along with mine for now since they got screwed by the pandemic. It won't be for long but I would need to maintain my salary of 89k atleast to do so. Is that doable if I switch? I can leetcode very very well. I am learning the whole algorithms and data structures aspect but, my math background kinda helps out a lot (I dual majored in math in college). This whole thing got brought up because my friend at Capital One landed about that much starting off in Texas. But I don't know if he was a fluke. ",

A two year contract seems reasonable since they would want a return on their investment. The problem it seems like employment can be inconsistent. I've seen people say they've been put on projects that only last a couple moths. Afterwards it seems like they would have to wait until Revature finds a new position for them once their current is over and finding a job on your own with a company they're not affiliated with would violate the contract. If that's the case, Revature doesn't seem worth it since there's a possibility I could be in a completely new state, out of work, and at the mercy of my employment company. Do I have this right?

Since I wasn't aware whether I'm getting the raise or not  (when inquiring I was only told that it's in progress, I sort of felt like I'm not getting it) I began searching for something new. \n\nI applied for couple of companies, got couple much better offers and told my manager look, I got these much better offers what raise can you offer me to stay - this was very lucrative since they offered me 30% raise. The offers I got were still better by around 20% but since I like my current job, maybe it's a bit boring but I'm working only couple hours a day realistically with no stress and flexibile working hours, I stayed.\n\nBut then there was this one company that I was in recruitment process with and just for kicks, because I got the raise already, I told them I want a LOT of money - we're talking around 50% more than my current role with a raise. \n\nIt's worth mentioning that I work in Europe where I'm already earning the top 2% salary in my country.\n\nIt seems they weren't really discouraged by that and I got the offer.\n\nNow I'm faced with a really tough decision - whether to stay in my comfortable current role which already pays a lot ,with no stress and working couple of hours a day or change for this new one.\n\nThe new role has couple of cons though\n\n* the working hours are not that flexible (8-16) I prefer working a bit earlier (7-15)\n* more work - I'm assuming I will have to start working like a regular human being 8 hours a day\n* more responsibility since I would assume ownership of their app and will be the only person working on it\n* changing jobs is always stressful since there will be new people which might not be reasonable (the guys I spoke during the interview were pokay though)\n\nI feel I'm already a bit spoiled by the current role and it might be healthy for me to start working more :D \n\nBut whenever I think about the cons I also think about money which would allow me to buy a house in my country every year :D",

I am not overenthusiastic about having a clean code or using the best design pattern etc. I am not interested in learning new technologies or nerding out about a new tech stack.I have also noticed that in B / A- level companies, there is undue pressure on developers to meet deadlines, perform R&D, produce a result and at the end of the day, fight the fire if something goes wrong. I get too overwhelmed by all the code reviews, GIT merges, build failures, dealing with scrum, story points, deadlines, product issues, etc.\n\nOne thing I do enjoy is writing automated and integration tests. Figure out how things can break, and automating that. I feel like I know what needs to be done, there are no surprises or unknowns and it being lower-level work, there are no scrum master and product owner constantly on my tail for status updates. As long as I provide agreed-upon test coverage, everyone leaves me alone.\n\nI am not expecting a mega-level salary by fully transitioning to SDET but just curious how is / will be the job market for it if I ever get laid off or want to switch companies.",

        "body": "So, a bit of context.\n\nI've been in tech for a bit less than 4 years now. Initially, I was working with a lot of technologies like .NET/Android/Deployement as an intern/Jr Developer. But since mid-2018 I've been mostly working in Front-end. In these 4 years, I've worked at 3 different companies (a small tech service company, a big product based e-commerce firm, and a couple years-old decently funded startup). So, it's safe to say that I've seen it all.  \n\n\nBack in high-school I had a huge interest in CS and always aced the CS exams and that's the reason I got a CSE degree (from a below-average school with average grades). But that's not the case now. Since the past 2 years, I'm constantly doubting if CS is really the right career for me. To be honest, the only reason I'm in tech is because it pays well. But, there's no gurantee that 10 years from now, there would still be such high salaries for software engineers. Currently the demand-supply ration is skewed towards engineers (for mid and senior positions). But, with 10 year olds learning to code in school, It's hard to envision what the future will be.\n\n  \nI'd love to study CS concepts even if I wasn't paid to do it. But working in the industry, it just induces so much anxiety to me on a daily basis. One reason for that is that I'm just not good enough and I'm probably mediocre at best (possiblly low-iq or I'm just not wired that way). But even if that were true, I see a lot of mediocre guys who are living a stress-free life.\n\n  \nThe reason for my anxiety is that there's so much to wrap your head around and it's hard to keep up if you want to stay in the industry. Due to living in constant hell, I'm considering a career-shift in psychology due to the following reasons:\n\n1. It would help me understand myself better and figure out the issues I'm going through\n2. I've always been intersted in how the brain functions what causes addictions.\n3. It woud give me some time to heal my brain\n4. Psychology degrees are not as demanding as CS (from what I've heard). This could be a chance to explore other interests and figure out what I really want to do with my life.\n\n  \nPlan is to go for a master's degree and then probably go into a specalised field where I could use both, my CS and Psych degree or work my way towards a Phd.\n\nI don't know if I'm delusional or just straight up crazy. But, life's too short.  I don't want to be 80 and have regrets that I just wasted my life doing something I wasn't enjoying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr;**\n\nWorkign as a software engineer in the industry is mentally taxing.

I like the job I guess, but I don't have any work experience in CS related fields besides this one, so what do I know about whether I really like it or not lol. I've been here for 2 months, by the end of month 3 I am apparently supposed to either get fired or be offered a full time position there (I am like 90% sure I'm getting a full time offering fwiw). No idea what the full time salary would be, but I imagine its probably around $36/hr? Just based off vague salary discussions with my friend who works there lol\n\nI feel like I have so little experience, and so I feel a desire to reach out and just acquire as many work experiences as possible. To me, working somewhere new often seems like an important thing to do since I'm young and trying to dip my feet in the water you know? But my friend says its too soon and I should at least get a full year with this company, saying that it looks bad if I were to work somewhere for less than a year. However, don't internships carry the connotation of being a work thing that is understood to not have to be a year+ endeavour? So I was thinking maybe I could get away with only working there for 3-4 whatever months, and then snagging a new job that hopefully teaches new things and experiences I wouldn't normally learn from working at this specific company. I have to acknowledge though, I am so new to a lot of software engineering that if I worked at this company for a full year I know I would learn plenty of software development...\n\nI made a bullet list of reasons I want to and don't want to leave. I was wondering if anyone here could graciously offer their advice/suggestion on what I should do? **Should I try to find a new job after working at an internship for 3-4 months, or stay with the company for a full time SW Eng. position because its too short of a time to dip out?**\n\nReasons I want to leave:\n* I feel a strong urge to get many different work experiences while I'm young\n* I want to work abroad badly. I'd stay with this job if they let me work remote 100% of the time temporarily, like for a 6 month span so that I could live abroad, but I highly doubt that they'd let me do that even if covid is still going on\n* Not 100% sure, but I think I could find a job with better pay than this company without much difficulty. I just say that because I think its a small enough company and the nature of the company + my experiences so far makes it seem like the kind of company that compensates for paying employees less by giving them greater work freedom/control over their actual programming and promising better wlb.\n\nReasons I don't:\n* This company has incredible wlb, definitely better than almost all other places\n* I actually work with a long time college friend here who helped me get the job, I would definitely miss working with him but you know, if its better for my future career prospects I'm not gonna stay at one company forever just to work with a friend",

        "body": "A certain co-worker whom I have had virtually no interactions with previous to this most recent project has on 2 separate occasions accused me of ulterior motives and such which include:\n\n1. When I raised certain concerns about the ability to integrate a new technology into multiple projects that all currently have different build library dependencies and asked about a compromise solution that has been brought up before, I was told that I need to show more respect to the time that was put in to the current proposed solution and that they felt they were only hearing excuses for not wanting to use a new technology (note that I am not the only one to raise these questions before this happened).\n2. When a discussion about this technology was held with a wider group of people that are involved in projects that would be incorporating this new technology at some point (some relatively soon and other a bit later), another person brought up the issue about the build library dependencies (and other issues) and suggested the same compromise solution I did in the previous meeting and I made mention of a task that we had planned for testing that possible issue (this was the outcome of the previous mentioned meeting). Just me bring this up made the same person from the previous meeting tell me that it was an inappropriate setting to bring this up (which I though was odd as that task directly relates to the question that was asked) and that he feared that what I am doing is trying to spread unfair fear and doubt about this technology (other people have brought up other / similar concerns but maybe this person thinks they are only doing that because of me or something).\n\nIf people want to disagree with my opinions or even concerns that I had, I have no problem with that, I am not a stranger to being in the minority when it comes to certain opinions on how to proceed with things but the outcomes of these disagreements are always based on data in some form and not accusing other people of lying or making things up to get their way. What I have virtually zero tolerance for is some telling me I mean something other than what I am saying. If I thought a piece of technology should not be used, I would say exact that with whatever reasons I have for thinking that way.\n\nNormally I would try to have a one on one with this person to figure out a better way to work together however given that in my limited interactions with this person I have already be accused of some ulterior motive that is deeper than what I am actually say, I would have concerns about a one on one and how this person might\u00a0view\u00a0that\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0completely\u00a0different\u00a0manner.\n\nRight now I really don't want to work with this other person at all as I think this kind of hostile work interaction is completely avoidable and counter-productive to the work we are trying to do (I have only deal with this kind of situation, though not directly, once in my 13+ years as a software engineer) and adding this kind of unnecessary stress in addition to the stress that is inherit with the job is just not worth it for me but because of the dynamics of the teams, I think future interactions are unavoidable. The only thing I can think of is agreeing to work on projects with this person but just holding any feedback I might have as to decisions on how to move forward on those project to myself to avoid derailing any project because of something that might not even be related to the project itself and just doing what tasks are given to me.\n\nHow would you handle this situation?",

The choice of the tech-stack, design, etc. will be left up to us. It feels like quite a lot of responsibility for an intern with not that much experience.\n\nAnother problem is that the CEO will be our supervisor. He isn't a strong programmer and we won't have access to more experienced developers to learn from, ask questions, or get some suggestions. I lack the confidence that we can make the best decisions and handle all the aspects of development by ourselves as interns. On the positive side, if we come up with a viable solution we will have a job there after the internship.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I overthinking this and should just accept this internship position or try to find a place that has a bigger dev team that I could learn from? How important was it for you to communicate and learn from more experienced developers during your internship?\n\nTL;DR - Got offered an internship position in a small company where I won't be able to work with or learn from other, more experienced developers.

No onboarding, no shit. They were like they want to do X. So I, from scratch had to build up the codebase that we currently have . Also note that there is nobody to help me label the images or to create datasets, I spend my time building datasets and implementing machine learning pipelines for this system. 50% of my time, I write new features for the code base I make, and the other 50% I test and make sure everything works (physically on the machine / hardware setup) without glitches. There were times when I had to literally go and solder connections between different microprocessors in different modules of this system. I had to setup the system infrastructure (Nvidia GPU Compute server + Network based control and integration different electronic subsystems) and Software Architecture from absolute scratch.\n\nNow the CEO (an asshole) keeps pushing new features one after the other like a feature creep, he doesn't care what I do, he doesn't understand shit about code. Nobody at this startup codes. Recently, he has stopped caring about this project like there are no meetings, or so regrading this major project. He gives a big fuck to the smallest things like why is there dust on the robots? (LOL). So recently, This Boomer CEO is like can you teach me how to code so he can do my job(lol wtf?) . I genuinely thought he is interested in learning programing. Now he is blackmailing me if I don't teach him with PowerPoint slides he is gonna fire me. How the fuck did I end up at this shit show?. Also the CEO is a moonlighting idiot, he rarely cares about this startup and does his 2nd job all the time. Recently he hired some interns to setup his mining server lol.\n\nOh by the way I get paid 1500$ per month lol (yep in a shitty 3rd world country).\n\nHow can I save my career ?

I am curious to know if pursuing a PhD in Computer Science would make it any easier to get a job at a big tech company (FAANG or Big N) for someone with little to no experience. I just finished my master's and I passed up on a PhD opportunity I was not sure about. I understand that generally people who go for a PhD want to do research on a certain topic or pursue academia. Now during my job hunt I have seen quite a few (not necessarily a lot though) jobs at big tech companies like VMware and Nvidia that want people with PhD degrees. So it is making me second guess my decision about the PhD. However, I really want to go in a security focused role and my understanding is that experience should be even more viable in that case? I feel like I have a long road ahead of me trying to find my \"dream job\", so to speak, coming out of a Master's program with only a couple of internships and I don't know how to take it.\n\nRelated post I found from search: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lluolt/is\\_going\\_to\\_grad\\_school\\_worth\\_it\\_or\\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lluolt/is_going_to_grad_school_worth_it_or_not/)",

        "body": "Hey everyone!\n\nI am a CS student who will be applying for jobs in tech later this year. After reading a couple of blog posts on employee experience at FAANG(all major tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple) and in other companies like Stripe, Lyft, Razorpay,etc, I have noticed something which I think might be crucial to career growth.\n\nSo I was reading about the procedure at Google, where there is promotion committee. You submit a report on how your contributions to Google helped it and why you should be promoted. Now this committee has never seen your work before and decides whether you should be promoted based on the application. But not everything is quantifiable, like how someone helped his teammates or made documentation for legacy project, etc. These things do not really have well defined metrics. So I believe there are many who work at FAANG but are not promoted easily. They are stuck at the same level for quit a few years.\n\nOn the other hand, companies like Stripe, or startups, etc, although may not provide similar benefits like FAANG, but due to their relatively smaller teams provide better communication among members. This does not mean easy promotion but this also does not mean that individual contributions are not noticeable.\n\nSo my doubt is, if I work at a big tech company for say 4-5 years but with no or just one promotion, then decide to quit and look for job at some other company, is the absence of promotion going to hurt my chances to get a job even though I used to work at the big tech company?\n\nOr if I work at startup, get a few promotions, and then look for job elsewhere, is that better?\n\nNow I am not saying big companies don't promote. One could argue that if one is competent enough company will promote that person. It is just that, since I haven't yet experienced working at a company, I don't know if the competent thing really plays that big of a role in real world or does show business has its role to play too.",

We don\u2019t have a lot in common, it\u2019s mostly inertia that we still maintain relationships.  \n\nI\u2019ve tried to network and meet people but it\u2019s hard when your job demands most of your day. The pandemic obviously made this harder. \n\nAny thoughts on how to make friends in this industry, outside of co workers, with somewhat similar interests?",
