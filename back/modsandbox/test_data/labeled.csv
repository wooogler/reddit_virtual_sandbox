ncjpgt,kool_guy_345,Process of getting into Jane Street as a junior engineer,"Long time lurker here

My dream company to work for is Jane Street Capital in the New York office. I'm intrigued by the fact that they primarily use OCaml for the sake of code clarity and from what I know the culture seems pretty good. I do also know, however, that it's notoriously hard to get into. I'd like to know if anyone has any insight on how to maximize chances of getting in like what to put on my resume, what things to study and practice before the interview, etc.

A bit about me, I'm a math major with a CS minor with 3.7 GPA from an alright-to-decent school. My work experience consists of one data science internship where I didn't do much and I currently work at Amazon and approaching the 4 year mark so I want to switch to something else once I get all my stocks. I don't really have any side projects and wouldn't call myself a super good programmer, I am only particularly comfortable in Java and Python and don't know many software engineering tools other than tools internal to Amazon. To be honest I think I lucked out on my Amazon interview because my raw programming skill is kind of weak. However I am decently good at puzzles/riddles and so I think I can understand complicated algorithms conceptually but I would need to practice a lot to be able to code them out. I never did competitive programming or anything like that but I did well in advanced algorithms courses which were based on pseudo code and proofs and diagrams. Also, as a math major, I found big O to be pretty easy compared to the kinds of math I did in my program. I don't think I would have any trouble analyzing the run time of programs and finding places where there could be optimizations.

I'd be super interested in knowing what my chances of making it to the interview are and if anyone has any ideas for things I should practice or improve on to maximize my chance of getting in. I heard that Jane Street doesn't usually interview people who failed an interview with them before and so I'd like to get it right the first time. And while I went to a pretty good school I don't think it's a target school so that also hurts my chances, and I'm not sure what their GPA cutoff is or if there even is one.

nci7bm,Shipwreck-Siren,Is there any way to find overlaps between non-IT/CS experience and the experience required for IT/CS jobs in order to qualify to apply for them?,"I'm currently in a state government job that I'm miserable in and I'm reaching my breaking point. I have a B.S. in Economics. I've been considering a switch to tech and am working through CS50 and then want to move onto other certifications for Linux, Networking, Systems Admin, etc. Almost every entry-level job that I'm finding is negotiable on degree and certificates, but usually requires at least 1-2 years of experience in IT settings. I know that for many jobs you can find overlaps between experience and get interviewed and even hired without having direct experience. I'm wondering if this is true for IT/CS? I saw this job posted with the state and I'm wondering if any of my experience can be applied. Is saying that I'm working through CS50 enough? What kind of non-IT/CS experience can qualify for the information security field? I feel like a lot of my current experience as a labor market analyst can meet similarities with the other duties, but I don't have direct experience in an IT setting. I've tried writing scripts to make my tasks more efficient in the little time that I have and started learning Linux last year before the pandemic started. I would like to at least try to apply but asking if you have that experience is an initial qualifier/disqualifier. I feel like I'm trapped because of how little I can devote to my certificates/training around this full-time job and it is DRAINING me after 3 years. I'm trying to stay in some level of public sector work so that makes my options more limited.

I have a B.S. in Economics. I've been considering a switch to tech and am working through CS50 and then want to move onto other certifications for Linux, Networking, Systems Admin, etc. Almost every entry-level job that I'm finding is negotiable on degree and certificates, but usually requires at least 1-2 years of experience in IT settings. I know that for many jobs you can find overlaps between experience and get interviewed and even hired without having direct experience. I'm wondering if this is true for IT/CS? I saw this job posted with the state and I'm wondering if any of my experience can be applied. Is saying that I'm working through CS50 enough? What kind of non-IT/CS experience can qualify for the information security field? I feel like a lot of my current experience as a labor market analyst can meet similarities with the other duties, but I don't have direct experience in an IT setting. I've tried writing scripts to make my tasks more efficient in the little time that I have and started learning Linux last year before the pandemic started. I would like to at least try to apply but asking if you have that experience is an initial qualifier/disqualifier. I feel like I'm trapped because of how little I can devote to my certificates/training around this full-time job and it is DRAINING me after 3 years. I'm trying to stay in some level of public sector work so that makes my options more limited.

nci3mb,courtois26,Prospects for STEM PhD dropout going into Industry,"I am currently pursuing a PhD in maths at a top school in the US. However, this might not be the correct path for me, since I don't have the passion for research and academic pursuit that my peers have. Therefore, dropping out and getting a CS (or Finance) job has become a serious consideration for me.

Is there a standard way of saying you're planning to dropout (in your resumé or during interviews) without sounding like a quitter?

If you are wondering, here is a bit more about my background. I did by undergrad in pure math at a top school in the US and went straight to my current PhD program after that. ***I have no internships*** or previous experience (in CS or finance) except for a quantitative trading internship this summer at a top firm.

nchynj,GirthyConsequences,Raises and career progression as Junior Dev,"I was hired as a new grad, ""Software Engineer I"" this past August. I was offered 60k (plus yearly profit share bonus that tends to be 20-30% of salary) in a Medium CoL area.  Because the pandemic was still pretty fresh at the time and jobs were scarce, I didn't negotiate my offer at all and took the 60k. At the yearly review in January I was given a ""prorated"" raise to 62k since I was only 4 months into the job.

I absolutely love this job, but I do regret not negotiating my starting salary. It feels like I've lost out on a lot of compensation. Typical pay for entry level devs in my area 70k, and while this company gives out hefty bonuses that make my pay come close to average, those bonuses are highly variable and certainly not guaranteed, especially as the company grows.

I'm coming up on 1 year of experience now and I'd like to ask for a raise. I would love 70k but I don't know if that's too much to expect, especially as Software Engineer I. And I have no idea when I could be promoted to Software Engineer II or what pay increase that would entail?

I have recently started working (2 weeks) as a software engineer at a reputable financial company. However, I have recently received a competitive offer from a tech company based in Seattle and their offer explodes in 3 days. (They are fully aware that I recently started at another company)

&#x200B;

The team I am on at my current company (financial one) is not legacy or boring work. I am working on features for a new financial application that will be released in the coming months. However, my onboarding has been a shitshow but it's slowly getting better... I am not sure the team knew that I was joining LOL I would say this financial company would be considered the top bank/investment institution in the world.

&#x200B;

The team at the tech company is a customer data backend-focused team. Not the most exciting team but I got the chance to actually meet the team and the hiring manager during the interviews.  The company is a not FAANG tier, but it is a company most people have heard about before and is a company you would find in Silicon Valley. The culture and team seem awesome and seem like an awesome place to work.

&#x200B;

So basically if I were to leave my current company, I would be blacklisted by the financial world possibly... my question is what is best for my career? (Salary, Learning, Career Progress, etc...) My goal is to learn as much as a developer as possible to eventually start my own startup and to earn as much as possible.

ncg7us,WTFranklin,Career advice for kind of experienced and kind of not developer,"I graduated from college about 3 years ago and I've had four jobs since then. I've had a difficult time finding a the ""right fit"" and as far as I can tell it's everything to do with my level of experience and not as much my personality. My first job was a contract job that ended because the contract ended and they didn't renew due to the company having some internal issues. I ended up leaving my next job due to wanting to work in a different technology stack. The next place I worked put me in a position where they cut my pay massively hoping I would quit so they didn't have to pay me unemployment due to me underperforming in my position and I just got let go from my job yesterday where they claimed ""the company was going in a different direction"" and they wanted more senior level developers on the team. I assume that's true, but I still get the impression they thought I might have been underperforming based on other parts of that conversation. 

I'm job hunting now and am trying to figure out what I should be looking for in order to work at a place long term and grow as a developer in order to fill in any possibile gaps in knowledge I have so I can improve. I'm sticking to postings that specifically say entry level or junior to be on the safe side. I have a lot of experience mainly with web technologies like html/css/JavaScript and PHP/MySQL.

I ended up leaving my next job due to wanting to work in a different technology stack. The next place I worked put me in a position where they cut my pay massively hoping I would quit so they didn't have to pay me unemployment due to me underperforming in my position and I just got let go from my job yesterday where they claimed ""the company was going in a different direction"" and they wanted more senior level developers on the team. I assume that's true, but I still get the impression they thought I might have been underperforming based on other parts of that conversation.

ncfx15,Content_Zombie_1257,I kind of hate my job but the company is great. Not sure if it’s me or the job.,"Long story short I used to work a variety of blue collar jobs before I got into making videogames as a hobby. I love game dev and i hope to release my own game in the near future. I decided I could escape blue collar life by learning to code more professionally and I did. I got a job at a healthcare company writing SQL and SSRS reports. 3 years later I got promoted to a new position working with MS Dynamics. 

The company and culture, while corporate and corny at times, is anything but toxic. I feel valued and rewarded for my hard work. Management is supportive and it’s a very collaborative atmosphere. Office politics exist I’m sure but I don’t have to worry about them. PTO is generous and so is the pay. 

But I just can’t focus. I’m just not interested in any of this shit. It was the same with both the SQL and dynamics positions, which as tools are both fine and kind of fun to work with, but in the context of healthcare and the corporate world I just really have trouble staying on top of all the meetings, different projects, terminology, processes, ect. I’m feeling overwhelmed. I swear to god sometimes a meeting will just land on my calander with zero context and people will talk to me as if I’m an expert in whatever it is they’re talking about but I literally have no clue. Sometimes I ask for context beforehand and it’s just more shit I don’t understand. I feel like I’m low IQ and just managed to charm my way into this job.

I have no idea what the hell is going on most of the time and I just kind of stumble my way through everything until it’s “done” and either deployed or forgotten about for 3 months until it randomly comes up again. I the meantime 6 other things will be piled onto my plate. Sometimes I finish shit without understanding what I did or what it’s for.

My honest feelings are that I don’t give a shit about my job. I just want to develop my games but I’m not naive, I know putting it all on the line in the hopes my little indie game will take off is a dumb move... I just can’t stand the office life. I feel like I’m so stressed out for no reason. I exercise regularly and whatnot but I feel like my body is in worse shape than when I was landscaping lol

ncemsk,ghostmansd,Any C work at kernel/user space boundary?,"I've been working in one of big companies developing custom OS for several years. My activities included developing userspace services, custom libc and some S/W parts of the proprietary kernel. This was a job I really liked; the only reason I left it was a lack of understanding how tech processes should work. For several years, me and many my colleagues tried to change the situation, with little to no success; when most of talented colleagues left, I felt that the project stagnates, and also took an uneasy decision to leave.

Anyway, even after some months passed, I feel that I really miss what I did there. I really liked the job, only political questions or absurd management made it less attractive. I would really like to find some project which is concentrated around the stuff I used to do. I'm particularly interested in concepts like capabilities, TCB, object-oriented; OSes and frameworks which attract me most include Fuchsia, Capsicum, Windows (not API-wise, though) and similar. I mostly dealt with C over these years; my C++ skills are rusty. Anyway, language is not a problem, I can learn new languages as well; I simply prefer C.

An ideal project would be:

* An operating system which is aware of Orange Book and TCB, and tries to follow these principles to at least some extent.
* Mostly userspace activities, like libc development, implementing miscellaneous services, perhaps even RPC to some degree.
* It'd be perfect if I could operate on kernel/userspace boundaries, e.g. implementing new system calls or other kernel<=>userspace interfaces.
* Preferably the significant part is written in C, which I know much better than anything else; other languages are not a problem, the C is simply the favorite one.
* The project has some space for an architect.
* The job is remote.

Of course, I realize that it's rather difficult to meet all these criteria; I mostly shown them for an illustration of what I like and prefer. I tried investigating many jobs available, but, given somewhat narrowed scope, it's difficult to find something. Most vacancies for C developer I checked deal with either firmware or hardware; whilst I'd really like to become proficient in these areas as well, I'd like to at least start with fields where I feel myself already proficient enough. That said, I'm OK to use languages other than C, and participate in projects which deal with other userspace parts; above is an ideal image of the world, I realize it's close to impossible to find something that specific.

I'm struggling to find something which matches my interests, and would be glad for any tip. Finding a job which matches these criteria via search engines is difficult, if not impossible, but perhaps real people can give me an advice?

I am a Jr. level developer and I have been applying to places like crazy the past month. In the past two weeks I have interviewed for 10 different positions at 9 different companies.

This past Wednesday I interviewed in person (weird, I know) with a small company about a 30 min drive from me. I really enjoyed the interview and they really enjoyed me as well. The CTO walked me out and told me she sincerely enjoyed the interview.

They are one of the best companies to work for in the entire state. Not only that, but I am interviewing for two different jobs with this company.

The issue is that the small company said they move fast and will let me know mid next week if I get the job, and while I cannot be totally sure they will send me an offer, I do feel very good about it. At the same time, the bigger company I am interviewing with can move a little bit slower. I do not want to reject the small offer just in hopes that the larger company sends an offer. What is the best way to handle this situation?

Should I inform the large company at the end of the interview that I am expecting an offer from the small company sometime next week? And that I would rather work for them, but do not want to screw up my chances with the smaller company? Do I let the small company know that I am waiting on results from the large company?

My Chinese is getting a bit rusty so I might have missed a few details, but this seems to be what happened: 

There's this intern from Peking University who worked Jan - Apr and told her leader that she wants to leave in April because they're busy with graduating. The leader said no because she didn't find a replacement for her position and told her to keep working. After May 1st, a junior of the leader's joined the team, so OP wrote a 10,000 character transitional document and asked to quit on May 11th again, but the leader said that OP still couldn't leave because the backup wasn't found by the OP. On top of that, the leader said to OP that their working skills are really bad and they have to find two backups (replacements) to fill the holes in her work and questioned OP why they couldn't find a replacement when everyone else could. 

OP's post then goes into detail about legality (no mention of needing to find a replacement before leaving), violence at the workplace (OP's roommate's leader told the roommate that ""leaving without finding a replacement is irresponsible"", and when OP brought this issue to HR, HR said that OP was arguing about semantics / denying that the leader had said such a thing), why they needed two backups (was she doing two people's work?), and double standards (a roommate of hers didn't need to find a backup to leave, so why would she need to?).

ncch8s,Synergy182,What would you choose: Fund vs Bank,"Hello all,

I'm based in Toronto and just got a Developer offer from CPP Investment Board while I'm currently working as an Analyst (not FTE) at one of the top 2 banks in Canada.

New offer:   
Base Pay: 94K + 10% bonus + 5% RRSP matching

Counter FTE offer from bank:  
Base Pay: 90K + 10% bonus + 3% RRSP matching

Now the compensation is similar but biggest thing is lack of development opportunities in my current role and after talking to my boss he said if you decide to stay - he wants me for at least 2 years at the minimum (so no flexibility to move laterally). On top, I have 1 on-call week every month which is draining as it ruins my sleep schedule.

Now I was leaning towards taking the new offer and leaving, because Dev position, AWS is being onboarded, no on-call stuff as of now, the pros are looking good for the new position right? 

Well they were till I started looking at GlassDoor reviews for CPPIB, a lot of people are not liking the new CTO (hired in 2018) and now this is making me doubtful on my decision.

New offer:   
Base Pay: 94K + 10% bonus + 5% RRSP matching

Counter FTE offer from bank:  
Base Pay: 90K + 10% bonus + 3% RRSP matching

Now the compensation is similar but biggest thing is lack of development opportunities in my current role and after talking to my boss he said if you decide to stay - he wants me for at least 2 years at the minimum (so no flexibility to move laterally). On top, I have 1 on-call week every month which is draining as it ruins my sleep schedule.

Now I was leaning towards taking the new offer and leaving, because Dev position, AWS is being onboarded, no on-call stuff as of now, the pros are looking good for the new position right? 

Well they were till I started looking at GlassDoor reviews for CPPIB, a lot of people are not liking the new CTO (hired in 2018) and now this is making me doubtful on my decision.

So what would you do as a 20 something year old starting their career? (I have 3 years of industry exp. with 1 of them being internships).",1621009143
nccdrb,fahova,"Cushy low paying SWE vs. High paying ""Demo Engineer""","&#x200B;

Hey. I graduated from university a year ago and have been working for a year as a back-end engineer. I was applying during peak COVID so I took the first decent job I found. The work is ok for me (I like designing APIs), the people are great, the work-life balance is impeccable but for my experience and skillset, I'm being grossly underpaid ($72k/y +8k bonus) (HCOL).

 I don't think there is much room for working on newer projects at my current company (cut and dry, develop this feature, fix this bug, etc).  I very much want to leave for a company that will pay me more, and allow me to work with engineers that I can learn from. The only redeeming quality about this company is that I only have to work like \~15h a week MAX. No micromanaging.

I know that I'm being underpaid, so I've been grinding LC for the past 3 months and I'm making steady progress. I've been taking all the SWE interviews I can get just for the practice and recently I've been offered a glorified Sales Engineer job. The comp is \~120K + 15-20k bonuses. This is basically 50K more than I make now. The role doesn't sound very appealing, but from what I can gather they want someone to come to develop tools and scripts to automate their demo environment (so there would be some SWE). 

Regardless, I would still keep grinding LC if I took this job because I don't want to end up in the sales engineering world. **Will taking this job hurt my ability to pivot back to a pure SWE role?**  Would you give up insane WLB + vacation days for 50K for a temporary role as a sales engineer?

Right now I'm still confused. An extra (50k / y) would be extremely great, I just don't want to hurt my ability to get back into an SWE role... 

Also, this company I'm currently at is working at knows I want a raise, and I've been vocal about it but I'm met with nothing but lip service.

TLDR: 

option A: stay at current company, maybe get a 10-15k raise within the year, continue to work on CRUD APIs but not work with newer tech stacks / develop my skills that much.

option B: go to company B, make $50k more at least, and do something I also don't particularly enjoy, that moves outside of the SWE world, and continue to study.",1621008889,t3_nccdrb,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nccdrb/cushy_low_paying_swe_vs_high_paying_demo_engineer/,1861,3553,0,1446349236,1394,0,0,fahova,"&#x200B;

ncbq99,MachHommy8,Junior SWE at Big Tech: this is not what I expected,"Hi all, I was very fortunate to begin a new grad job eight months ago on a team that develops a popular cloud-based product. My manager and teammates are great and I get along very well with everyone. I use a modern, in-demand tech stack and am paid well above market rate. With that said, my time here has been extremely challenging. I work longs hours yet am doing much less coding than I anticipated. The breakdown is approximately:

30% — Development. We do not have dedicated QA or ops teams, so a good portion of this time is spent either testing or handling build/deployment issues.

25% — Docs, investigations, proposals, etc. Every change at this company requires time-consuming processes and external approval.

20% — On-call activities. We have frequent week-long stretches of 24 hour on-call where getting multiple pages per day is the norm. We are expected to work a backlog of on-call-related tasks when not actively working a page, so I do not touch code while on-call.

15% — Monotonous, repetitive tasks. This includes enabling feature flags and manual testing for things that we cannot automate.

10% — Meetings.

I’m not sure how normal this is for a junior, but I suspect it is not normal at all.

I have discussed the issue with my manager multiple times. He pays lip service to correcting the imbalance but I feel that I am stuck in an endless cycle of activities that are not enriching my skill-set as a developer. I have some interesting projects lined up but they require many hours of investigation and proposals before I’ll touch any code.

My biggest concern is that my experience looks good on paper but, in reality, is lacking. Future employers may expect more from me than I am capable of delivering, given my sub-par experience at my current job.

I am not sure how long I will stay with this company; I am in my 30s and want something more laid back and without so much on-call. However, I worry about leaving my first job too soon and how this may be perceived by future employers.

Is this what modern software development is like at big companies? Am I doing something wrong? Is there anything I can do to improve my situation?

ncbd37,Vnslover,"We just switched from waterfall to agile at my company, as a junior Dev I'm a bit intimidated, any advice?","Hello guys, I guess I also have some additional questions too. 

So I have been working at this financial firm as a contractor the past 2 years (first job) and recently they have extended me an offer to become a full time employee. 

We had been using waterfall so basically we would have a bundle every 3 months, I got used to that and it worked fine, that gave me a lot of time to research and be able to code everything before the deadline comes up. 

A month ago we switched to agile, we have two weeks sprints now, and also I have switched to another team so the projects are all kinds new to me. 

I'm just feeling a bit overwhelmed and starting to feel ""guilty"" for not being fast enough, we have many meetings during the week and while I communicate fine and I'm very professional I feel bad that my whole team are way smarter than me, granted I am the only junior Dev and they are all seniors, but I feel like overall I'm slow and like 10 mins in during a technical meeting I get pretty lost, while the rest of the team keep talking very technical until the meeting is done, it doesn't help that I have ADHD too lol but I am taking meds and they are helping a bit. 

I would say overall, I have not received any negative feedback from either my managers or my colleagues, in fact both of them recommended me and spoke great things about me, but I have this crippling feeling that I just keep getting ""lucky"" and I will very soon be ""exposed"" and then crash and burn. 

And ever since I started working from home last year this feeling had been getting worse, I always feel like I'm deceiving everyone around me and I'm not smart or good as they think I am. I guess this is all caused by years of being in the engineering school and building the imposter syndrome, and having to be like that for all those job interviews. 

I also think ever since I started working from home I keep having the urge to log in to my work laptop again after work hours, I really don't feel ""done"" for the day if that makes sense. 

Anyone dealt with those issues before? And how did you overcome them?

So maybe I'll gain some work ex of 1-2 years before I pursue MS. I'm okayish at coding. I can code but couldn't in front of someone in an interview. I'll be flustered lol. However, I'm good at math.

I always wondered what a typical day looks like for a PhD student (especially in ML/DL).

Do you have classes daily? Are they too complicated to understand? I sometimes feel I'll be too dumb to cstch upon and everyone knows everything except me.

I wouldn't want to become a professor after doing a PhD, do CS PhDs (mostly Computer Vision or something related to Deep Learning) work in the industry? From what I know they mostly tend to stay in the academia. Personally, I don't want to.

Do you get a chance to intern? Do internships pay well?

nc0jni,Rcturbos,Setting Career up for Failure,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I feel like I have made some mistakes in my career, luckily I think they have been early enough is isn't to late to try and salvage the situation. I am curious to hear everyone's take on what is going on.

&#x200B;

I was working at a fairly large military contractor for last part of my schooling, and worked full time for a year (graduated in April). So started in Jan of last year and left in Feb. This job was great actually really enjoyed it, there was those days where I hated it but for the most part everyone was super collaborative, interesting work, modern stack, and not much to complain about. Then they started doing restructuring they ended up selling my team   to another company, got put on a new team, then that new team started getting dissolved, and I basically was unsure about my job and what was really going on. In addition to every thing that was going on after talking to other friends I realized I was getting pretty underpaid compared to market value for the area, I was getting paid 72k, and most places were 80-90.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now, I took a new job that is fully remote (it's local but they gave me the option to work remote), the job paying a lot better $110, which honestly probably is way to much, but hey they offered it.  However that is where this drama just barely starts. So this job has a TON of technical debt, more so then what they originally told me.  They have a backlog of almost a year plus worth of bugs, angular 8, and what not.  With this technical debt there are lot of bugs (I would say 70% of backlog items), many of which aren't even fixable with current stack, or super hard to trouble shoot.   


As we fix issues there is no current process to really test against production environment, and QA testers also are stuck with half testing it. So with that we fix things and it introduces other small things, or maybe it wasn't possibly fixed. Which is fine, but it is difficult cause all of these come back to look like its my fault.. Which our team is really small its me and one other guys (which doesn't do a ton). But lately I feel like everything has been a complete mess, and everyone is playing the blame game, and complaining stuff is not getting done fast enough. Which is the furthest from the truth. Which I think my manager would back me up, but I can tell hes starting to get frustrated with everything that is going on.

&#x200B;

With that I have started to document every single thing I'm working on, what I found, who I worked with, just if something was to hit the fan. But I  basically am worried that based off past stories I have heard one day I will just go in and they will let me go. (I guess they dont usually hire full time (as I am), looking at the company states 80% of work force is contracted employees) Which this was my worry all along because I know looking like a job hopper is not good. 

&#x200B;

There are plenty of other stuff going on with the company, which honestly is just shady (they've been lying to 3rd parties, and I have to say stuff particular way or they get stuck paying more money). Just to list a few..  I'm worried if I'm let go it basically sets me up for a super bad looking resume and 100% a job hopper.... Feel like it's a touch situation to be in.

Which I think my manager would back me up, but I can tell hes starting to get frustrated with everything that is going on.

&#x200B;

With that I have started to document every single thing I'm working on, what I found, who I worked with, just if something was to hit the fan. But I  basically am worried that based off past stories I have heard one day I will just go in and they will let me go. (I guess they dont usually hire full time (as I am), looking at the company states 80% of work force is contracted employees) Which this was my worry all along because I know looking like a job hopper is not good. 

&#x200B;

There are plenty of other stuff going on with the company, which honestly is just shady (they've been lying to 3rd parties, and I have to say stuff particular way or they get stuck paying more money). Just to list a few..  I'm worried if I'm let go it basically sets me up for a super bad looking resume and 100% a job hopper.... Feel like it's a touch situation to be in.

nc0gap,semicharmedliife,Wtf is going on with my recruiter???,"Hi Redditors, I ran into the strangest situation this week and am looking for some thoughts and advice on what to do.

**TL;DR:** As a contractor, I applied for an internal FTE position for the same role under my current manager that I was basically told I would for sure get. After my interviews and all positive feedback from them, recruiting won't move forward with my application. Could the recruiter have something against me or a vested interest to hire external candidates?

Details:

I'm currently work as a contractor at a fairly large tech company via a consulting company. There's an opening for a full time position on my team for the same role that I'm working in now. (FYI, it's not SDE but similar.) I joined late last year and am doing well, so my manager (who's also the hiring manager for the position) recommended me to apply. Unfortunately, since it's a bigger company with a lot of rules, there's no simple conversion from contractor to FTE - I have to go through the full interview process. My manager basically told me this would just be a formality and my interviews would mostly be with people on our team whom I already work with.

I finished all the interviews and got positive feedback during all of them. After a week, I asked my manager if there any updates and he said he hasn't heard from recruiting. So I reached out to recruiting asking when I can expect to hear and they said they're still debriefing other candidates and will get back to me when that's done.

The thing is, it's kind of strange but I was also asked to help out as interviewer for the same position that I am applying to since there are two FTE positions open for this role. Since I'm the only person doing this work right now on the team and whoever else we hire will be working closely with me, my manager wanted me to be an interviewer. So I interviewed a couple other candidates the same week I had my own interview. Recruiting held a debrief session with the interviewers - including me - and the candidates got the decisions within 3 days after their interviews. We didn't hire them. (Btw, I'm not involved as an interviewer anymore, because recruiting found out that I was a contractor and there is some rule that contractors can't be interviewers for FTE positions.)

So now it's been \~2 weeks after my own interviews and I still haven't heard anything. I asked my manager about this again today. He said he's asked recruiting several times to move forward with setting up the debrief meeting for me, but that they ""seemed to be ignoring his requests."" He told me that even though recruiting doesn't have a say in who gets hired, he is dependent on them to coordinate the process.

I wonder why this recruiter assigned to me is refusing to move forward with my application? I haven't talked to them in person outside of a couple email exchanges, all very brief and polite from both sides. Even the initial ""recruiter screen"" and scheduling the interviews were done by other people. So I don't think they have anything against me personally, but perhaps they have a vested interest to hire the candidates that are sourced/introduced by them? Has anyone heard of this happening?

What should I do in this situation?? Can this recruiter actually block me from being hired? At this rate, they will continue delaying my application while they continue bringing in new candidates. And I'll be forced to extend my contract after it ends next month (and obviously, not guaranteed that I can continue extending in the future) and miss out on this FTE opening.",1620967177,t3_nc0gap,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nc0gap/wtf_is_going_on_with_my_recruiter/,10,221,1,1583285254,1423,0,0,semicharmedliife,"Hi Redditors, I ran into the strangest situation this week and am looking for some thoughts and advice on what to do.

nbzq58,HeatLevel,what is the best mindset for developers?,"Hello, I'm a junior dev at a start up company.

nbyjvz,wanderingchords,(Hopefully)Not typical question about Programming Certificate.,"As the title suggests, I don't want to ask the ""Is this certificate worth it?"" I've seen often on this and other forums about the subject. I am passionate about, and excited to start my first college experience getting this certificate! I will work hard to build a portfolio to interest potential employers and demonstrate my knowledge. I'm excited to change careers from a completely unrelated field that I've grown to hate, and am aware of the challenges that presents. And I'm definitely doing this certificate because its the best option i have available to me without going into a mountain of debt. 

What I did want to ask is if anyone else had earned a certificate similar to this one?(link below) 

How does the curriculum compare to yours? 

Of course I'd love to hear it landed you a great job with no experience based solely on what you were taught, but if it didn't, what eventually did aside from building a great portfolio and contributing to projects? 

And of course I'd love to hear any other thoughts you think are relevant!

I'm very excited to start creating and contributing to things as soon as I'm able to and appreciate any advice on how i can get the most out of this!

So, I was lucky to be able to get a great programming job right out of college. Great pay for my first job, with raises contractually guaranteed once I learn the language used... The problem is that the language in question is Perl (along with MySQL).

The main programming languages that I used in college were Python and Java, so I'm a tad concerned that Perl is no longer what employers are looking for.

I’m pretty sure any internship is better than none but want to hear your opinions. Also asked my manager and she asked what I would like to or achieve at my internship and I talked about improving web development skills so I might also work with whatever team that is?",1620951394

Today he indicated that I may receive an offer from the company, however the salary may not be exactly what I want so I'm hoping to get some advice from yous guys. 

I just graduated college with an Associate degree. I've already been working as a programmer for about a year now for $55k a year. The recruiter told me the salary range for the new job is $70k - $85k annually. This is in medium/high cost of living city in the Midwest.

I'm familiar with ASP.NET Core, however this company uses the older ASP.NET Framework which I'm not familiar with.

nboydy,No_Working_8095,"Job changed dramatically recently, getting red flags?","I'm the lead engineer on a small team at a non-tech company (I refer to my work as ""enterprise software development""). It's just me and a few juniors. My boss is an architect, kind of. I'll also add that I'm a decent developer, but by no means am I ""FAANG-worthy"".

I've really enjoyed my job up until recently. I've had agency to implement things however I want, and I took that opportunity to make sure we were doing everything in a forward-thinking and well thought-out way, even if that meant taking a few hours/days to try a few things out. By doing this, I learned a lot and even got to build some really neat solutions to problems we encountered while trying to build as smartly as possible.

Some time ago, our CTO decided he wanted our company to be more tech-focused, and chose my boss's team to sort of spear-head this move. Since then, a lot of what we've been developing has been proofs of concept for different business-units, who are used to finding external vendors for technical needs. There was, understandably, considerable push-back to a lot of our work, because change isn't easy--it never is.

This sort of came to a head a few weeks ago when I was working on a 1-2 week PoC for some business unit (important information: we're a global company, so sometimes there's a language barrier when speaking with other business units). Throughout the development process I kept my boss informed. I told him what I understood the problem to be and how I planned to implement it. I then had him test it out and give me feedback so that I could make it really clean for the inevitable demo to the business unit who asked for it. He was on board... Until the day of the demo. We met (via zoom) to dry-run the demo and he told me, more or less, that in all of his conversations with the requesting business unit he'd never heard them complain about what my PoC aimed to solve, that he wasn't sure the product demo was going to go over well because of that. I was, I think understandably, upset. I asked him why he had approved of me working on this, why I hadn't gotten this feedback earlier, etc. and he just said ""I made a mistake"". Needless to say, the demo went poorly.

This is one instance, but we've been running into this similar issue (the poor demos, not the miscommunications) for a while and it's got me questioning my role at this company. Aside from this, I've been realizing lately that I have only been learning as much as I have because I chose to. There's not really anyone technical enough around me to give me feedback on my methods or talk through alternative options. Nobody would know if I built stuff in a shitty way, and that *feels* like a yellow, if not red, flag.

The relationship I have with my boss, which used to be very amicable and relatively close, has been strained by these turns of events, and the stress of work has started to bleed into my not-at-work life (I'm remote, so it's a figurative not-at-work).

Finally, on Monday my boss told me I needed to let a few other folks (who I don't know and have never worked with) have access to our cloud-provider account (like, give them permission to create resources & all that). I asked him what sort of governance we were putting in place to make sure that nothing got out of hand, because it's my role to monitor our cloud-resources and when something's fishy, security comes after me, not him. He said, basically, that we can trust these folks, they're superior to me, etc. and that if security hassled me, I should just refer them to him instead. This feels messy and like it's just asking to be a pain in my neck long term.

Is it time to start polishing my resume? Am I over-reacting? If I leave, it's just a bunch of juniors and an architect, and nobody really knows what we have other than myself (I keep our documentation available to everyone, but that doesn't mean they use it). The juniors would have no mentor and the architect hasn't written code in I don't know how long. I'm not, like, emotionally invested in the success of my employer, so leaving wouldn't really bother me, but I'm sort of at the point in my life where I'd like a ""career position"" so I wouldn't have to shop around for raises & whatnot every few years as is the norm in the tech world.

nbomcd,metamaniac551,Another PM vs. SWE Post,"I know this question/topic has been brought up multiple times on this sub, but I wanted to ask it again in the context of my personal experience. I'm currently going into my senior year at a top 10 university (top 10 overall, not necessarily for CS), and I'm studying CS and EE. After a few business/consulting-focused internships, I'm looking to go into tech as I feel it would be a waste not to apply my technical background, and I really am interested in the industry. I have some solid programming skills and projects (mostly from CS classes I've taken), so I think I would fair well as a SWE if I work hard enough, but I don't ever see myself being the ""best"" SWE, or even among the top 5-10% of developers. Thus, I am already planning on going into SWE for a few years, then transitioning into something else, like PM. 

I also know that PM roles are extremely hard to come by, and the best time to snag one would be right after graduation. I think I would enjoy a PM role and my skill set is more aligned for PM, but I am concerned about getting into a leadership-type role in tech straight out of college. Again, I will have a CS degree from a great school and have some decent programming experience, but I'm certainly not the best programmer around or someone who codes for fun in their free time. Thus, it seems like I would be out of place starting off as a PM right away and being tasked with leading a team of engineers who are much more skilled than me. 

I feel like if I start out in SWE and gain some legitimate technical experience, then I would be a far more effective leader and PM, but on the flip side, getting a role in PM after working in SWE is harder than getting one right out of college. Am I misconstruing what a PM really does or overestimating the technical ability required? I've always felt that my leadership style is most effective when I am as knowledgeable about a task as the people I am working with, but perhaps that is not how I should be looking at PM roles. If anyone has any advice on the decision between going into PM right after college vs transitioning into it after a few years of development experience, I would love to hear your thoughts.

If anyone has had or is having vision issues like mine please share your experience on how you have dealt or deal with it. I’m not gonna let a lazy or wandering eye hinder me from programming since it something I love to do and enjoy a lot.",1620931203

nbndvk,DrSomm,What should my path of education look like with no college degree and no prior coding experience?,"I'm currently in the wine industry and the past year has shown me how volatile my industry can be, so I'm looking to start a career in programming. I've been researching for a few hours and I haven't really gotten anywhere in regards to the most efficient way I should be learning. When I originally taught myself about wine I spent way too much time learning things that weren't relevant at all, like maximum residual sugar levels of obscure wine regions. I want to make sure I don't make that type of mistake again, and it seems easy considering how many free resources are out there.  


Potentially relevant information:

* I'm technologically inclined. I have a relatively firm understanding of how operating systems work and how to utilize some technical features. 
* I don't have a history of being very good at math, but that could be due to the quality and/or lack of teaching on the subject. 
* I have a lot of free time.  


Questions I have:

* My brother is an IT Director and therefor has friends in the industry, but too busy to answer many questions. From a brief interaction I was told my career path depends on what ""stack"" I want to learn, and whether or not I want to work on the design or engineering side. **What is the most widely desired ""stack""?**

This may not be the place for it, but it is career related so here it goes.

I currently work for a large tech company (F100), but not one of the usual suspects you typically hear about here. 

Anyways, I've been building a software development company for the past year and everything is going really well. I landed a huge account that wants to do a minimum of 80hrs a week, which is awesome, but I also don't have the capacity to do this. I also don't want to quit just yet, but it looks like that's what I'm going to have to do.

I have 4 contractors that are good for basic tasks, but none of them are senior enough to take on more responsibility or bring on full-time. In fact, I tried hiring for a full stack stack senior dev at $110,000 with basic benefits (health, vision, dental) and got ZERO bites. 

I'm wondering what I should do here, as finding a senior dev has been extremely difficult. Ideally, I'd like to find someone with ambition and would be willing to take the $110 + some equity to make it worth wild, but I don't even know if that would be enough.

I graduated in May 2020 just when corona was in full swing. I had around 100 application out at the time just shotgunning for an entry level job, and got 2 responses back both negative. Everyone dropped their summer programs, like half of my college friends were fired from their internships before the first day. For a few months I bounced between doing resume stuffer projects and sending out applications. I was approaching around 200 applications total when I finally got a response from some IT contract position at the local school system. This was really sub-optimal but at this point I was desperate and was willing to work anywhere as long as it was with a computer. It was a good temporary job but I was really dissatisfied with it since the work was repetitive and really easy, not to mention the poor pay. I started applying more on linked in near the end of the contract, and by some miracle an honest-to-goodness software role wanted an interview with me. The interview was almost devoid of technical questions, was obviously just a means for the contracting agency to steal someone's paycheck, and I was hired within 3 days. The pay was not great but is was enough to where I could pay rent and get by. Fast forward 5 months of working remotely doing interesting but underpaid work and developing my stack, some college buddies recommended I try messaging a recruiter for a growing fintech company in my area. About a month of pestering the recruiter finally got me a interview, and I passed with flying colors. Now I have a full-time career with perfectly acceptable pay for a newish grad with great benefits.

I just got promoted to mid level dev at my current company. I thought the raise was a little weak, around 9%. I went from around 77K to 84K in a MCOL city. I decided to see what I am worth else where.

I was able to get an offer for $100K for another mid level position. I like really like my company, at least more than the one I have the offer from. Both have good vacation, company retreats, paid training, maternity/paternity leave(not worried about this). Both are private companies that are profitable. Also both are fullstack positions. Here are some differences:

Current company: $84300

* Health benefits day 1
   * but a $400/m cost for PPO for my partner and I
      * partner will be getting an job in September so this will go down to $130 soon
   * dental is around $30/m (will go down in Sept as well)
   * vision is a cost too but I don't use it
* 3 weeks of vacation, 3 personal days (was given an extra week off in 2020 and 2021)
* the week between Christmas and new years off
* 401k Match up to 5%
* bonus around 10%
* raises seem weak. I got 3% after 6 months and a promotion was only 9%
* HR and CEO control salaries

New Company: $100000

* Health benefits on day 60 ( I would HAVE to negotiate this to day 1 to even take this position)
   * dental, vision and level 1 of health care is on them for my partner and I
   * I can pay for more health coverage if we need it
* unlimited PTO
* No 401K =(
* average bonus is 3.8% (a little low)
* raises are better 5%-10%
* CTO is a partner and has more control over salaries

I think I want to stay with my current company. I like what I work on and the people I work with. Not offering insurance on Day 1 and no 401K seems like a red flag to me on the new company.

How can I use this offer to negotiate with my current company? I want to seem appreciative but I also want to be paid what I am worth. How do I approach my manager about it even though he has little control over this? His manager has more control, should I just go straight to him or is that wrong to go over his head?

Any advice is appreciated.

How can I use this offer to negotiate with my current company? I want to seem appreciative but I also want to be paid what I am worth. How do I approach my manager about it even though he has little control over this? His manager has more control, should I just go straight to him or is that wrong to go over his head?

Any advice is appreciated.

TLDR; got an offer from another company with a 20% increase. I want to stay at my company. how do I leverage that with my current company to get a raise?",1620924024

nbifvk,GuardTheGrey,How to progress my career,"Hey guys, I'm finding myself in a weird spot in my career, and struggling to figure out how to move forward.

For context, I graduated in 19, and I've been working at one company since graduating.

I work for a consulting firm in the Midwest. I know it's not the most glamorous job, but the pay and benefits were competitive for the area and at the time location was really important to me.

Shortly after I started working, someone requested that I transfer into their department with the promises of being able to work on exciting technologies and expand my skill set, in addition to being 100% remote. This obviously appealed to me so I signed on.

The reality of it was that the team that was being put together failed to sign a single contract. So, I was assigned to a project in the meantime to ensure I was billing hours. That project was a small dumpster fire, and was entirely ETL and SQL work.

After a few months it was obvious that the project was not advancing my career. I wasn't learning new languages, new skills, or improving the ones I already had. I was working with legacy ""code"", and the client was not interested in improvements or optimizations. They just wanted the product to work, and pay as little as possible to maintain it. There was no incentive for me to learn how to improve or optimize the work I was doing as a result, and I didn't have the budget to explore those things even if I wanted to. Something to consider is that because of the projects problems I got a ton of experience working directly with clients, managing and deciding on budgets, resolution times ,etc. I did a lot of the work of the PM in this role, as our PM took a backseat on a lot of this work. I consider this to be great experience, even though it was stressful at the time, but I'm not sure how to leverage it when searching for jobs.

A few months ago, my boss left our department despite never fulfilling his promises on the kind of work I'd be a part of. I really feel like this has set me back in a huge way.

Recently I was transferred away from that project onto another project that is entirely SQL work. This is despite the fact that I've been very vocal about my concerns as regarding my career development.

I have a bachelor's in CS and an OCA certification for Java, but it's been nearly two years since I've written real code. What do I need to learn/do to start putting myself in a position that I will be a competitive candidate for a role where I'll get to do what I actually want to do?

My interest right now is in full stack development, but I'm open to anything that really requires me to think and optimize and improve my work. Problem solving is what I love about this field, so if anyone has any other suggestions I'm all ears.

I love working with backend languages like python, java, and C++, but recently I've been trying my hand at Javascript and found that to be pretty enjoyable too.

I did create a small website using one of the main frameworks years ago, that had a front end/back end that worked and was hosted by a hosting service, so I know I can do it. But it's been so long that I can't quite remember the steps I need to take 

I'm currently taking an online course on Javascript (udemy) to try to get a really deep understanding of the language before I try my hand at properly learning a framework. My HTML and CSS skills are terrible (right now, but I'm sure I can improve with some elbow grease).

I am moving closer to a larger city (30 min drive) so hopefully my options for employers will greatly expand once I make the move.

nbhjy2,MrSirDuckDude,Struggling to secure a software engineering job with my mostly self-taught background and looking for advice,"TL;DR: I've been transitioning to programming just from my own self-studying and guidance from my mentor, and I just wanted to get some feedback since I've been getting very antsy about securing a job. I have about 8 months of informal experience working with JavaScript/React, although I've been doing an internship for a month so far at a brand new start-up working on the MVP for a React chat app. Can I get a full-time (ideally tech) job with this kind of background? Any tips on how I can make that happen? I do have a mechanical engineering degree and some years of experience there, but yeah trying to switch to coding, which so far I like a lot better.

Full background:

I started learning JavaScript basics at the beginning of 2020 to get ready for a coding boot camp, but then the whole pandemic thing happened and I felt less inclined to do the boot camp's remote program. Fortunately, I had a close friend who's a Software Engineer and also had prior experience teaching at a boot camp, and he offered to teach me personally as my mentor. He put together his own curriculum tailored for me based on what he thought would be most beneficial, starting with some cs fundamentals, then more web fundamentals, and then finally putting together an actual web application with React. I spent a lot of time building it under his guidance, really making sure to have a polished final product for my portfolio and resume (you can check it out here if you like: [https://www.rolemate.io](https://www.rolemate.io/jobs))

With that experience, I was fortunately able to get a Software Engineering internship at a startup, where we're working on the very early stages of an app creating the MVP for a social app. It's been pretty good React experience as well as I've been working on new features with the guidance of the Senior Software Engineer.

And of course, I've also been practicing with algorithms (my least favorite part) with an online course and just grinding away on different problems and mock interviews. This part is probably my weakest area and I'm still struggling to get solutions consistently.

I've always had an interest in programming but for whatever reason didn't go to school for it. I think when I was younger I just didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and it was hard to choose from all the options available to me. Also, I was terrible at school and ended up dropping out anyway. It's not that I'm dumb, I've just always found it hard to focus in school. I may have some undiagnosed ADHD and other illnesses that I'm going to therapy for now though.

Currently I work for a company as their sole Tech Support person. I'm feeling really burnt out lately and realized I don't want to do this for the rest of my life. I'm looking into either going back to school or attending a bootcamp. I'm not sure what to pick. 

&#x200B;

* If I went to a university I'd have to take out a loan (if even possible with my credit score). I'm planning on buying a house soon so that will probably drop my score even more. Not sure if that affects getting school loans at all. 
* I suck at math. Are there any CS degrees with less complex math or are they all kinda the same? I will 100% try to apply myself regardless but... yea. 
* What remote-learning schools do people recommend?

Also, I was terrible at school and ended up dropping out anyway. It's not that I'm dumb, I've just always found it hard to focus in school. I may have some undiagnosed ADHD and other illnesses that I'm going to therapy for now though. 

&#x200B;

Currently I work for a company as their sole Tech Support person. I'm feeling really burnt out lately and realized I don't want to do this for the rest of my life. I'm looking into either going back to school or attending a bootcamp. I'm not sure what to pick. 

&#x200B;

* If I went to a university I'd have to take out a loan (if even possible with my credit score). I'm planning on buying a house soon so that will probably drop my score even more. Not sure if that affects getting school loans at all. 
* I suck at math. Are there any CS degrees with less complex math or are they all kinda the same? I will 100% try to apply myself regardless but... yea. 
* What remote-learning schools do people recommend?
* What bootcamps do people recommend/have had success from? Did you have any prior education before the bootcamp?

&#x200B;

I think that's pretty much it for my questions. Thanks!",1620914638

I'm at the start of this crossroads where I know I want to move on and that I will but am uncertain how to best do so. I spend almost all of my hobbyist time programming in C#, and it's something I really enjoy.

I am conditionally admitted to a Computer Science M aster's of S cience program; meaning I would need to take approximately 24-30 hours of the core classes of their Computer Science BS degree, which would take me a full year before formally enrolling in the M aster's program. This path would, thereby, take me at least the end of Fall 2023 or Winter 2023 s emesters.

I have immediately enrolled in the first of these core classes for the Summer to orient myself back toward academia; I would imagine I could land some form of internship, part-time or full-time, during this time to support myself, right?

I started working in this field around 5-6 years ago, and finished uni 2 years ago. Currently I'm working at one of the best companies in my city, meaning I get to work with the best people in this field. I'm pretty good at what I do, at least according to my performance reviews. From the outside, everything about my career seems perfect, I got promoted almost every year, and I get paid really well with stock options.

However, lately I've been having my doubts. I don't really consider myself an extremely extrovert person, but whenever I don't meet someone for 24 hours my mood falls down significantly. I love talking to other people, getting to know other people, travelling, and in general I like to be on the move all the time. I just hate being in one place.

Hi all, 
I just got my masters this semester and i worked throughout the 2 years i went to school. My job helped pay for it as well.

It is my first job after getting my undergrad degree. I got promoted to an SE2 about 2 months ago due to the amount of time ive been working there. Usually SE2 are reserved for people who have about 3 years experience or if not then for people with their masters degree. 

Since i have my masters now and three years experience, is it worth asking my manager what other benefits i could get. Like i said i just got promoted to SE2 so i doubt theyll give me another promotion again. I also have to commit to them for another year since they helped pay for school, so i have even less leverage there as well.

I've been taking CE courses for a bit over a year now with the goal of getting a software engineering certification from the university I'm attending.

Familiar with a bunch of third-party tools that I've never heard of like WireShark or SoapUI.

nb6ndc,Iwasashitperson,I was doxxed and have some questions on if I should pursue a career or give it all up.,"Hello, I come with an unusual question / scenario and was looking to get some advice or information from people who are in the field.

I'm 23 and about to graduate with a CS degree and a 3.2 GPA from a decent university. I really like C# and .NET and have several webapps out there that I designed, built and deployed by myself(Including one that makes me a little $$!). I have a decent resume and would consider myself to be a proficient programmer who has enough full stack projects out there to let a potential employer know I'm a good candidate.

I'll skip the pity stories because no one gives a shit, but I didn't have it easy growing up and often turned to trolling and being a piece of shit online for entertainment when I was a teen, it was the best form of attention I could get at the time. I used to bait people on reddit, twitter, and other social medias and say some dumbass shit, I loved the thrill of seeing just how many angry replies I could get and how angry people would get at me. This all took place when I was ages 15-18. 

I made the foolish mistake of trusting a good IRL friend of mine with this knowledge of my shit past and about 3 years ago we had a falling out and he doxxed me hard on social media. The logs and things that he posted weren't the most obscene things on this earth, but it did paint me as a very shitty, racist, ignorant person, even though I know for a fact that I never truly believed those things and was just memeing and trolling like an idiot.

I could write for hours about all the things I lost because of it, but I don't want to bore everyone. I lost some old friends and my girlfriend had to disassociate herself with me for good, that one stung the most and still does to this moment.

Fast-forward to 3 years later, I've lost a lot of weight, been to therapy and can confidently say that I'm no longer that type of person at all, inside and out. I look back at those years with disgust. The original ""doxxing"" thread is now deleted. The comments on the thread are still there, and when you google my name, one of these comments comes up. It isn't a good look, but it's a lot better than before. I've tried many ways to see if the original doxx thread is archived anywhere but as far as I can tell it isn't (It definitely is somewhere out there, but it looks like it isn't traceable/ easily found)

So, as I begin to look for a start to my career, I wonder if it's even worth it to press forward, knowing that inevitably someone from HR or a team member or recruiter is gonna google my name and see those two comments labeling me as a piece of shit, It's only a comment or two, so there is a ton of plausible deniability with there being no concrete logs linking to my name. I can't have any social media anymore, as it would most likely just get harassed and to be honest I have no desire to maintain a social media presence at all, is this going to be a problem for your average company? Should I just own up to everything if ever asked? 

I'm sorry for writing this cringe, pathetic thread, and I'm sure that many reading this will say that I don't deserve to have a career of any sorts, and I can understand your position if this is the case. This is something that has consumed my life for several years now and has drove me to the brink of suicide and back several times.

I have about 10 YOE in software development during which I have taken team lead roles where I have done both technical leadership and people manager tasks for several years (including recruiting, performance reviews, promoting subordinates and more). 

I believe the primary reason I am not getting interviews is because I specifically lack roles with the title of Manager despite highly relevant experience that fits the job description.

I haven't gotten any internship offers throughout my 4 years in college. I did get coding challenges and a couple interviews, but no offers.

nb0hg2,john_flubber,"Stuck in ""Environment Setup"" for Almost 4 Months","Got a remote government project earlier this year and has me working in this incredibly constrained dev environment. I need to let off some steam because I have no idea how much of this is my fault or what I can really do to solve it, so maybe I can get your help on what to do at this point.

The problems began at the start, when the laptop they gave me made it impossible to run basic executables. The solution for that was to mail the laptop back for a replacement, which they only permitted me to do two months in. Then only when I got it back did I have to go on a business trip for another project for two more weeks, and by that point I forgot so much introductory information I was supposed to have remembered from onboarding. After that, I waited another two weeks for the helpdesk to download Node. I should also mention that I cannot download any software, I need to submit a ticket to the service desk and have them do it for me. This can take anywhere from days to weeks and they need to remote access my laptop to do the installation.

These delays compound with other issues (and my own mistakes) to bring me to today. I'm now four months into this project and still can't run a local instance.

It seems like the longer it goes on the more mistakes I make on my end. I can't concentrate on solving problems and I can't seem to remember anything.

I'm seeking new employment, but worry that the bad habits and work ethic I developed here will carry over to the new company. Wondering if any of you have gone through the same situation and how you dealt with it. No need to call me a shitty developer, I already convinced myself.

I wanted to ask you guys if it would be wise to include that I am attending college while trying to search for a $50k+ full-time web dev job. I feel like I would look too ""junior"", but then again, I am.

A little background on me: I am 22 (started college at 18, left at 20, am now back at 22), currently attending university to obtain a bachelor's in IT, and finishing my second year at the moment. However, I need a full time job (don't we all).

nazf6e,Unclematttt,Do not blindly trust Bootcamps or sites that aggregate Bootcamp reviews/details when it comes to placement rates/student success stories. Stories inside.,"Hello all!

I am a Data Engineer who was able to make the jump from just your ordinary schmuck to someone that gets to write code every day for a decent wage.  I have a bit of a story to tell about my experience, and it might be a little on the long-side, TL;DR will be at the bottom of the post.  I will leave some bullet-points as well so that I can offer advice on what I would do different if I had a time machine and could start from scratch.

Not too long ago, I had to close down my business that I was running, and I had enough cash on-hand to enroll into a Software Development bootcamp.  I will not disclose the bootcamp or my employer, this is purely a post to help out those of you who are at the stage where you are looking at where you may want to study.

When it came to looking for a bootcamp, I really had no idea how to tell who was good and who wasn't.  All of my local options were priced in a similar range, and they all claimed a high (90%+) placement rate, with job-placement staff on-site to help you navigate the wild world of job hunting as a Jr. Dev.

I ended up going with a ""cast a wide net with what you learn"" and ""learn at your own pace"" program.  What I found out was ""cast a wide net"" meant that I only got to learn a little bit of each technology we covered.  We went through HTML/CSS, SQL, Javascript, Python and C#/.NET in that order, with a heavy emphasis on .NET (and a little on .NET Core).  ""Learn at your own pace"" meant that we would be enrolling on online courses from places like Pluralsight and doing some skill checks and short coursework developed by their staff... of Jr Devs that ended up working there after they couldn't find a job in the field of their choice (this is confirmed by them to me, not speculation).

What's that, you say?  You paid over 10 grand to enroll in online courses and take some coursework developed by people who have zero industry experience?  That's correct.  At this point I want to briefly stop and note that not all camps are like this, I think I maybe just picked the worst of the bunch.  Please don't be like me, ask questions before you enroll like ""who developed your coursework?"" and ""What kind of real-world experience does your staff have?"".

Ok, so that kind of sucked, but at least I was going to get help finding a job when this was all over... right?  Not so much.  Our job placement guy was a total disappointment.  While he helped us write our resumes (they all looked the same... more on that later) and did mock interviews, the actual job placement part of his job left a lot to be desired.  He never actually looked for any jobs for me or my peers, instead opting to send us links to meetups around town, which if you have been to them, aren't exactly job fairs (although the networking can be beneficial).

When I actually did get some interviews (on my own, no thanks to my job-placement guy) I quickly learned that most companies do not want to hire folks like me with zero experience in the industry.  It is important to note that I went all-in on .NET, and was trying to get a job as a full-stack developer working with OOP (lol, I didn't even learn what an API was at the time as it was never taught to me or brought up in my coursework).  In one interview that I was able to secure, the interviewer asked me about my resume, specifically where/how it was written.  I let him know that it was written with the help of my camp's job placement guy and he flat-out told me that he had received roughly 25 applications from my peers and our resumes were exactly identical.  No idea why I got an interview and others didn't, maybe he was just curious.  I didn't get the job.

In the post title I also mentioned not to trust sites that promote ""hey go to this bootcamp!"" or ""here is a great story from Unclematttt about his experience with going from zero to hero!"".  This bit is what actually made me want to make this post.

There is a LinkedIn power-user (again, not going to disclose their name) who reached out to me and was chatting me up about his cool site that helped people just like me choose their bootcamp.  ""Hey Unclematttt, I see you went to XYZ Bootcamp- would you mind writing a review for my site and maybe doing a AMA for our users?""  I proceeded to tell him my experience was bad, I am pretty sure the camps lie about placement numbers (at least half of my 'graduating' class never even made it into the tech industry), and the job I ultimately got was more of a support role that was at my wife's work.  I actually had to grind my way up to this position by working double-time and developing helpful scripts and applications in my free time.

The power-user's response?  Silence.  I followed up a couple of days later to ask what their thoughts were, and they never responded.  I guess it didn't really fit the narrative that they were trying to push.

Now that I have shared my experience, I want to note a few things:

* There *are* quality bootcamps out there, I just ended up at one of the shitty ones (do your research)
* The job situation in my city (known as somewhat of a tech-hub in the region) might not be the same as your city
* I could have done more to build out my portfolio before applying to jobs and possibly giving a bad first-impression (don't be like me)

Here are some tips that I can share that I think might be helpful if you are just getting into the idea of picking out a school/bootcamp and want to be successful:

* I sound like a broken record here, but DO YOUR RESEARCH on your bootcamp.  Don't put blind trust into what they are *selling* you.  They churn through students and their goal is to just get your money and get you into their program
* If you are interested in full-stack development, take baby steps and learn everything you can about backend engineering first (what is/how to build an API, how do applications interact with databases, what are the hot SQL and NoSQL technologies in your area to learn, what are containers and how do they work, etc.).  Full-stack devs do not just sprout out of the ground IME, it can take years to become proficient with any given stack
* What stacks are hot right now?  Are there lots of jobs for ELK?  What about MEAN?  Find something that you like and go nuts on it
* Personalize your resume.  Start with what your camp/school helps you build, then do something (anything!) to make it different than your peers
* IME there was more success with Javascript devs from my camp than anyone else.  Consider learning Javascript in detail and some of the more popular frameworks like ~~AngularJS~~ and Vue (I have been informed that Angular isn't hot anymore- I am not a JS dev, so my apologies on that, research what frameworks are popular in your area.  Edit: this is debated below in the comments, so again do research on what Frameworks are popular in your area.)
* You will likely end up using databases in some way shape or form during your career, make sure you understand the ins-and-outs of various database technologies and how it applies to your stack/languages of choice
* Develop a solid portfolio.  If you are doing front-end work, this is a lot easier as people like ""pretty pictures"" (my opinion).  Make daily commits on Github (many employers will ask for your Github profile to check it out before deciding to interview you).  Also have a basic-to-awesome portfolio website, and even though we all hate it, get a LinkedIn account.  Consider buying the premium version if you have the cash for it.
* Try to find a language/stack that you are comfortable with and enjoy and go HARD on it.  Make sure before you make this decision that there are plenty of jobs that want those skills, there is fierce competition for Jr Dev roles, so you will need to apply to many of them (maybe even hundreds) before you land your first gig.
* Make sure you are in a good place mentally before starting on this journey.  It can be soul-crushing at times, but there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel if you persevere

I am a Data Engineer who was able to make the jump from just your ordinary schmuck to someone that gets to write code every day for a decent wage.  I have a bit of a story to tell about my experience, and it might be a little on the long-side, TL;DR will be at the bottom of the post.  I will leave some bullet-points as well so that I can offer advice on what I would do different if I had a time machine and could start from scratch.

Not too long ago, I had to close down my business that I was running, and I had enough cash on-hand to enroll into a Software Development bootcamp.  I will not disclose the bootcamp or my employer, this is purely a post to help out those of you who are at the stage where you are looking at where you may want to study.

When it came to looking for a bootcamp, I really had no idea how to tell who was good and who wasn't.  All of my local options were priced in a similar range, and they all claimed a high (90%+) placement rate, with job-placement staff on-site to help you navigate the wild world of job hunting as a Jr. Dev.

I ended up going with a ""cast a wide net with what you learn"" and ""learn at your own pace"" program.  What I found out was ""cast a wide net"" meant that I only got to learn a little bit of each technology we covered.  We went through HTML/CSS, SQL, Javascript, Python and C#/.NET in that order, with a heavy emphasis on .NET (and a little on .NET Core).  ""Learn at your own pace"" meant that we would be enrolling on online courses from places like Pluralsight and doing some skill checks and short coursework developed by their staff... of Jr Devs that ended up working there after they couldn't find a job in the field of their choice (this is confirmed by them to me, not speculation).

What's that, you say?  You paid over 10 grand to enroll in online courses and take some coursework developed by people who have zero industry experience?  That's correct.  At this point I want to briefly stop and note that not all camps are like this, I think I maybe just picked the worst of the bunch.  Please don't be like me, ask questions before you enroll like ""who developed your coursework?"" and ""What kind of real-world experience does your staff have?"".

Ok, so that kind of sucked, but at least I was going to get help finding a job when this was all over... right?  Not so much.  Our job placement guy was a total disappointment.  While he helped us write our resumes (they all looked the same... more on that later) and did mock interviews, the actual job placement part of his job left a lot to be desired.  He never actually looked for any jobs for me or my peers, instead opting to send us links to meetups around town, which if you have been to them, aren't exactly job fairs (although the networking can be beneficial).

When I actually did get some interviews (on my own, no thanks to my job-placement guy) I quickly learned that most companies do not want to hire folks like me with zero experience in the industry.  It is important to note that I went all-in on .NET, and was trying to get a job as a full-stack developer working with OOP (lol, I didn't even learn what an API was at the time as it was never taught to me or brought up in my coursework).  In one interview that I was able to secure, the interviewer asked me about my resume, specifically where/how it was written.  I let him know that it was written with the help of my camp's job placement guy and he flat-out told me that he had received roughly 25 applications from my peers and our resumes were exactly identical.  No idea why I got an interview and others didn't, maybe he was just curious.  I didn't get the job.

In the post title I also mentioned not to trust sites that promote ""hey go to this bootcamp!"" or ""here is a great story from Unclematttt about his experience with going from zero to hero!"".  This bit is what actually made me want to make this post.

There is a LinkedIn power-user (again, not going to disclose their name) who reached out to me and was chatting me up about his cool site that helped people just like me choose their bootcamp.  ""Hey Unclematttt, I see you went to XYZ Bootcamp- would you mind writing a review for my site and maybe doing a AMA for our users?""  I proceeded to tell him my experience was bad, I am pretty sure the camps lie about placement numbers (at least half of my 'graduating' class never even made it into the tech industry), and the job I ultimately got was more of a support role that was at my wife's work.  I actually had to grind my way up to this position by working double-time and developing helpful scripts and applications in my free time.

The power-user's response?  Silence.  I followed up a couple of days later to ask what their thoughts were, and they never responded.  I guess it didn't really fit the narrative that they were trying to push.

Now that I have shared my experience, I want to note a few things:

* There *are* quality bootcamps out there, I just ended up at one of the shitty ones (do your research)
* The job situation in my city (known as somewhat of a tech-hub in the region) might not be the same as your city
* I could have done more to build out my portfolio before applying to jobs and possibly giving a bad first-impression (don't be like me)

Here are some tips that I can share that I think might be helpful if you are just getting into the idea of picking out a school/bootcamp and want to be successful:

* I sound like a broken record here, but DO YOUR RESEARCH on your bootcamp.  Don't put blind trust into what they are *selling* you.  They churn through students and their goal is to just get your money and get you into their program
* If you are interested in full-stack development, take baby steps and learn everything you can about backend engineering first (what is/how to build an API, how do applications interact with databases, what are the hot SQL and NoSQL technologies in your area to learn, what are containers and how do they work, etc.).  Full-stack devs do not just sprout out of the ground IME, it can take years to become proficient with any given stack
* What stacks are hot right now?  Are there lots of jobs for ELK?  What about MEAN?  Find something that you like and go nuts on it
* Personalize your resume.  Start with what your camp/school helps you build, then do something (anything!) to make it different than your peers
* IME there was more success with Javascript devs from my camp than anyone else.  Consider learning Javascript in detail and some of the more popular frameworks like ~~AngularJS~~ and Vue (I have been informed that Angular isn't hot anymore- I am not a JS dev, so my apologies on that, research what frameworks are popular in your area.  Edit: this is debated below in the comments, so again do research on what Frameworks are popular in your area.)
* You will likely end up using databases in some way shape or form during your career, make sure you understand the ins-and-outs of various database technologies and how it applies to your stack/languages of choice
* Develop a solid portfolio.  If you are doing front-end work, this is a lot easier as people like ""pretty pictures"" (my opinion).  Make daily commits on Github (many employers will ask for your Github profile to check it out before deciding to interview you).  Also have a basic-to-awesome portfolio website, and even though we all hate it, get a LinkedIn account.  Consider buying the premium version if you have the cash for it.
* Try to find a language/stack that you are comfortable with and enjoy and go HARD on it.  Make sure before you make this decision that there are plenty of jobs that want those skills, there is fierce competition for Jr Dev roles, so you will need to apply to many of them (maybe even hundreds) before you land your first gig.
* Make sure you are in a good place mentally before starting on this journey.  It can be soul-crushing at times, but there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel if you persevere

I could write a whole lot more, but I think that this covers most of it.  Sorry for the long post, this is kind of therapeutic to write out.  Believe in yourself, but also take care of your future self by not making some of the mistakes I did along the way.  If I could do it, anyone can with the right amount of drive.

Join Quantitative Trading Team as a long term intern

Deep understanding of Probability Statistics ML

Proficiency in Python

Ability to deal with open ended problems

Working on real projects with experienced traders, researchers, developers

Apply ML techniques to derive novel findings regarding market behaviour from large datasets

My questions

1. So is this a research position or trader position? And what is the difference between a researcher, developer and trader?

2. What is the work life balance in general comparing to software developer positions. More working hours? On call? 

Also how common work from home, I heard it is rare because the company wouldn't want me to access my tech, data from home?

3. If I work in this position for a few years can I get into Software development or Data science if I don't like it. Would those two years be considered as two years experience in Data science, Software development? Since I am close to 30 this is really important for me.

4. Can I use the systems I developed in the team for my personal trades, investments?

5. Is there any short online course, tutorial I can try to be able to understand what this job will be like? And also to gain some knowledge before interview.

6. When I asked this in r/quant my post get removed and the mod messaged me a long post talking about how he quit his quant job and says I will quit too because this area is not beneficial to society and it will die after the big crash of today's financial system.

The terms of any contract of employment and job description will be relevant, however, these (and duties more generally) often evolve in the course of time and it may therefore not be appropriate to rely on them exclusively.

naxox2,IronBunny5,Application Analyst vs IT/ Staff Auditor," 

I have a background in healthcare and medical billing auditing. Just recently I accepted a position as a Staff/ IT Auditor.

Even more recently a recruiter reached out to me regrading an Application Analyst position.

My current position as an auditor can potentially lead to more complex IT auditing over time, but for now it's more reviewing screenshots of servers, reviewing a list of admin with access to said servers, and finding documentation and IT tickets to verify that they were previously approved to have access to these servers. Where as this Application Analyst position will give me IT experience since that is inheritably the job function.

As of now I have no interest in growing to a manger or director. But the idea of cyber security is intriguing as far as job growth in the next 5-10 years.

So my question is, should I stay with the Staff/ IT Auditing position which may eventually lead to more complex IT focused auditing, or change to Application Analyst and try to grow from there?

Any advice is appreciated, it's been difficult to find an IT job where someone is willing to take a chance on me, and now that there seems to be two options I'm trying to figure out which path may be more beneficial to my career growth.",1620849101,t3_naxox2,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/naxox2/application_analyst_vs_it_staff_auditor/,31,190,1,1522766182,1566,0,0,IronBunny5,"

I am a software engineer who is currently around a senior level. I recently got an email from a recruiter (for now I'll keep the recruitment company name hidden) that said they had a specific company with a specific job listing that was sent to me after I asked for more information and it seems like it all lines up... However, this is just where I wanted to see if these are big enough red flags to be wary of. 

&#x200B;

1. emailed me on my work email, had to ask at second email to contact me elsewhere
2. the recruitment company has a legit website and linked in and the website graphically is very clean. It only has a contact portion of it though with the CEO's phone number. It seems to be new and I don't know if this is something that happens with any sort of scam. i.e., sometimes in certain areas people make 'companies' over and over on platforms until their scam is caught but again just repeat that process and present themselves as a 'new' company. 
3. The insistence on that this is for a company that is looking to have the turnaround process of the interview in a very short time. It seems it is like the process feels perfect in regards to minimal interview(s).
4. pay is extremely good. Base is 2x what I make + bonus + shares.

&#x200B;

Things which are literally holding me to not think I am being crazy are:

1. recruiter is legit on linked in it seems.
2. job is for a company within nasdaq (can't find the posting elsewhere online but that is a given.
3. didn't seem like a mass generated email, it was very identifiable that they were talking to me.

So I am low income, first generation about to graduate with a CS BS and the interview market has hit hard. I have a 3.9 GPA from a top 50 CS school and have prepped well but it seems like CS was just a huge waste of time.

I go on LinkedIN and see all of these ""software engineers"" at these top companies and all I see is that they studied at top 10 schools studied a major completely abstract something like Industrial Engineer, Physics, Biology, even seen Art, and I'm assuming that they could not find jobs in their majors so they instead go into the software engineer route. They suddenly go from being a Masters + PhD in biology to a software engineer at FAANG within a year and in a way it frustrates me to know that these wealthy candidates only got into these top companies because they can afford to buy the resources, all the coursera courses they want, pay for a bootcamp, or CS MS, it's truthfully unfair.

I know I shouldn't judge but I truly am passionate about CS and to see wealthy candidates with no passion for CS (otherwise why wouldn't it be their undergrad?) switching to Software Engineering at FAANG companies immediately within a year through different means (e.g. references, family, wealth, buying resources, etc) and get in without having to even study CS is simply unfair.

nas8lt,Kaydee4154,Leaving a regular full-time job for a contract?,"I am currently a regular full-time software engineer for a pretty small company. I’ve been trying to jump the hurdle from SWE to Senior SWE for a while and I’m feeling pretty stuck. Not a lot of feedback from higher ups, peers don’t understand the pushback. In addition, the principal engineer on my team left recently and instead of adjusting timelines and searching for a new one, they’ve kept all of our deadlines and dumped a lot of his work on me. I’m capable of doing it and I find it interesting, but the pressure of the deadline is unreal and I’m annoyed that I can be given that responsibility and not the title. 

I was recently approached by a recruiter for a Senior SWE position that is an 18 month contract. The project is interesting to me and the hourly rate is pretty big (No PTO so factor that in, though the consulting company does provide health benefits and 401k ).

In addition, the principal engineer on my team left recently and instead of adjusting timelines and searching for a new one, they’ve kept all of our deadlines and dumped a lot of his work on me. I’m capable of doing it and I find it interesting, but the pressure of the deadline is unreal and I’m annoyed that I can be given that responsibility and not the title. 

I was recently approached by a recruiter for a Senior SWE position that is an 18 month contract.

naqx2c,amare_plango_vulnera,Returning to work after a long break for personal reasons. Seeking advice/resources to get back in the game.,"Hello everyone! I'm working on getting back into the workforce after a three-year gap. I figure I should lay out all the gory details so I can get the best advice possible.

Three years ago, I was laid off from my last job, where I worked for a little over two years as a data engineer. Prior to that, I worked as a technical consultant for two years at one of the big software giants (name omitted for privacy reasons). Subsequent to my layoff, my then-husband and I moved to my current city so I could begin a master's degree program. We had a nasty divorce as I embarked on my studies, which were going reasonably well until everything went remote. Coupled with my depression (which is being treated), the stress of the divorce and online classes forced me into a leave of absence from my graduate program, to which I may decide not to return in favor of finding a full-time job.

This is where I need some help. It's been a long time since I appeared for a technical interview, though I do have experience conducting such interviews from my last job. I have several books I am using as preparation materials (Algorithms Illuminated by Roughgarden, Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, et al, CTCI, and EPI) and I am also trying my hand at some of the practice interview problems on CodeSignal. I have always struggled with these types of questions despite my four-year degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, and I am finding the preparation process rather overwhelming. Furthermore, I am worried about the large gap in my resume. I suppose my explanation is reasonable, but how can I convince prospective employers to take a chance on me?

I feel very alone in this process, and it feels like the odds are stacked against me. Would I be better off just returning to my graduate program (my leave lasts until January)? How can I overcome this gap in my work history? I would also appreciate suggestions on effective strategies and helpful resources for brushing up on my skills and becoming more confident with technical questions.

nap2w0,KarlChinaski,Take offer as non-software engineer at big five as CS graduate?,"Hello!

**My questions:** 

*  Do you think it having a big five company on my CV will open up a lot of doors, even though it's not as a software engineer?
* Would you accept an offer as a non-software engineer at a big five company or keep trying for a software role at an unknown company?

**Some background:**

I'm graduating with a first class CS degree this month from a top tier UK university with zero internship experience. The only offer for a job I've got is as a data centre technician in Europe for one of the big five with a salary in the range £35-40k. 

The fact that I'm offered this job in the first place was a bit of a surprise as I've only really considered going into software engineering. My goal is to build a career in software engineering, but having lived a broke student life for the past 4 years, I'm very tempted by the idea of having a salary as soon as possible. My alternative is living off savings for the next 3-4 months after graduating and applying for software jobs while practicing interviews and personal projects. Another significant con of the technician role will require me to relocate to a place I don't really want to live.

Offer:

Remote with the occasional trip to HQ (once a month) -- I'm within driving distance so this is not expected to drag me through flights, etc.

Startup

Base pay > current

Currently no 401k match or bonus -- ""it's coming"" FWIW

100% health coverage

Equity

&#x200B;

Existing:

Small Design services team in large org COVID remote but very old school and continued pressure to return to office. By design services I mean other companies come to us to get it done.

Parent Org has recovered from COVID slowdown. Our division is beginning but I've spent \~15 months stringing 10 hour weeks together if that.

Base + Bonus + ESPP + 401k match

&#x200B;

Risk -

Obviously there is inherent risk in a startup. I feel there is a risk of layoff in my currently role, I'm surprised I'm still employed TBH, but I'm 1 of 1 for my discipline, so I think it's more about trying to attract work. It's hard to say, ""We can handle all your FW/HW needs"" when you don't have anyone to do it.

Variable pay -

Currently I have a 20% Bonus target, of which I've never seen more than 2.6%, although I only worked through one Bonus cycle (COVID). I also have ESPP which has a minimum payout and due to COVID had banner returns, all in this could potentially makeup \~$40k but expected to settle around \~$15-20k as the world returns to normal.

Startup has equity, if things go well this could return, but it is a hardware/services company. Historically, aside from Roku, we're not hearing that many Cinderella stories. Maybe see a 2x on the strike.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, I want to work on cool stuff. With young kids, being remote during the pandemic has been a nightmare and a blessing. Being able to reduce daycare bills is a plus, being able to tend to other things at home and not need to fill all my free time away from work with mundane tasks is huge. I don't miss the people in the office, I'm the guy that typically wears noise cancelling all day to work. I compartmentalize well and treat work as work.

I'm curious to hear how others are weighing their options as offices begin to push for return while remote work is simultaneously being flaunted in portions of tech.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

Startup with slightly higher base and full remote vs Public company with historical higher TC and office  demand. How much is full remote really worth?

nak84a,JiraMaster,What are my options for taking a breather to figure out what's happening in my life?,"I work for a tech company that's famous for PIPs and obsessing over metrics. I've been here for 1 year, and I'm actually finding my work very engaging, but there are just some issues I've noticed in this job for the past few months that make me feel like I can't work here anymore.

This discussion is not intended to be offensive, but I don't really know of a ""good"" way to describe my predicament.

Although our site is based in the US, 80% of our employees are on visa from a certain southeast Asian country. Some of my American coworkers who were on track for promotion and exceeding expectations under American-born managment were suddenly let go when management randomly got rearranged recently to be a supermajority of people from said country. They were all terminated  within two weeks of the permutation for ""exceptionally poor performance"", and never were they asked to improve/put on PIP. No one who was from this southeast Asian country was let go, even though I'm aware of a few people who are certainly not pulling their own weight. (for example, there's a girl who's been here two years who's still under the trainee permissions group only)

I'm currently under the last remaining American manager, but I'm receiving hints it's only a matter of time before I get moved to one of the other managers, and it's creating a silent sense of hostility that I'm not welcome here because I'm not ""one of them"". I'm not currently on PIP, but I think I only have about 3-4 months left here. I need some time to decompress, not worry about meeting my metrics, and start applying for new jobs, but I don't know how to do that. If I take PTO for a few days to do so, my metrics will fall. We're told that'll be taken into account in our 1-on-1 meetings if our performance suffers, but I feel like it'll just be turned around on me, saying I should be performing well enough that taking PTO shouldn't cause me to fail to meet my monthly goals.

**Questions**:

I've been here for 1 year, and I'm actually finding my work very engaging, but there are just some issues I've noticed in this job for the past few months that make me feel like I can't work here anymore.

This discussion is not intended to be offensive, but I don't really know of a ""good"" way to describe my predicament.

Although our site is based in the US, 80% of our employees are on visa from a certain southeast Asian country. Some of my American coworkers who were on track for promotion and exceeding expectations under American-born managment were suddenly let go when management randomly got rearranged recently to be a supermajority of people from said country. They were all terminated  within two weeks of the permutation for ""exceptionally poor performance"", and never were they asked to improve/put on PIP. No one who was from this southeast Asian country was let go, even though I'm aware of a few people who are certainly not pulling their own weight. (for example, there's a girl who's been here two years who's still under the trainee permissions group only)

I'm currently under the last remaining American manager, but I'm receiving hints it's only a matter of time before I get moved to one of the other managers, and it's creating a silent sense of hostility that I'm not welcome here because I'm not ""one of them"". I'm not currently on PIP, but I think I only have about 3-4 months left here. I need some time to decompress, not worry about meeting my metrics, and start applying for new jobs, but I don't know how to do that. If I take PTO for a few days to do so, my metrics will fall. We're told that'll be taken into account in our 1-on-1 meetings if our performance suffers, but I feel like it'll just be turned around on me, saying I should be performing well enough that taking PTO shouldn't cause me to fail to meet my monthly goals.

**Questions**:

* Is my only option to just try the PTO route and hope management doesn't try singling me out for it?
* With about one YOE, am I likely to be able to get out of here in 3-4 months, or do I need to take something else temporarily in the meantime, and try again later? Would that hurt my prospects to quit ***this*** job, go do something irrelevant for a few months, and apply to relevant jobs again afterwards?",1620810131

I'm still skeptical though since it has a rating of 3.3 on Blind and all the good reviews I found online are from 2016...

nacopg,renoreaper,Struggling to switch from tech consulting to software dev,"Hi All,

First post here, apologies if anything isn't in order.

I wanted to get some input/opinions on my situation from all the good folks here, as I've been trying to make this switch for a while now. Here's my situation:


- background/backstory (feel free to skip)
I'm in my early thirties, have worked almost a decade in tech consulting (implementing/configuring SQL-based tools for things like sales management and accounting). In that time I worked mostly as an individual contributor, with a few years as lead consultant for some bigger projects (switched back to single contributor after a mini-burn out and deciding that being in meetings/writing email all day wasn't for me).

I studied computer science in college back in Europe (about a decade ago) and am currently living and working in Toronto, Canada in consulting for a large organization (I actually quite like the company, I started here about 2 years ago, they have decent benefits/pay, though lately things have been changing slightly for the worse I find).

- challenge/goal:
I would want to switch to software development, my degree focused on this moreso, but due to circumstances and emigrating I kind of ended up in consulting. I'm finding it particularly challenging to find time/motivation to do side projects and coding after a full day at work (and I probably have some covid fatigue I think, measures downtown toronto have long been quite strict). In terms of prior coding experience: I got a Java certification a few years back and I have played around with  variety of language (Python, Java, C#, Cobol, Javascript etc.), but I find I'm lacking in recent and real world experience (as well as some of the supporting tools and technologies, things like Kubernetes or getting fully up to speed with AWS/Azure and microservice architecture).

I've spent the last few years thinking about making the switch, but have always come up lacking on the execution and I REALLY want to change that. However, I also know that doing this as a side project after work every day is quite likely to fail. For this reason I was thinking of enrolling in one of the coding bootcamps available here, they're quite pricey but I think it might be the fastest/surest way for me to get into a dev role sooner rather than later, which will ultimately help with me develop the required skills further (I like/enjoy studying and learning as part of a job and think I'm quite good at it). My question is what would you do in my situation? Any specific suggestions/ideas or any glaring oversights/flaws that you see with my approach? Also: any experience (attending or hiring from) any of the specific coding bootcamps in Toronto is also most welcome!

Thanks all,

I can't tell if it's this damn pandemic, burnout, or work life balance that's the issue, but at the end of the day I'm so tired, I barely have anything left to give to my family.
This might sound like complaining, but it's not.
I want to believe that there's something in the wide world of IT I can find that truely excites me. I've held many roles in my 20+ years in IT. I feel like all I've done is dabble, and I'm just a jack of all trades and master of none. It bothers me that I haven't found the thing that gets me excited and wakes me up with excitement to begin my day.  The thing I do better than most. I'm just ""meh"" about the work. Am I just being unrealistic?
I'm lucky to have a career in cybersecurity and I want to remain in this field. I believe there's something out there I can find that gets me excited.

I can't tell if it's this damn pandemic, burnout, or work life balance that's the issue, but at the end of the day I'm so tired, I barely have anything left to give to my family.
This might sound like complaining, but it's not.
I want to believe that there's something in the wide world of IT I can find that truely excites me. I've held many roles in my 20+ years in IT. I feel like all I've done is dabble, and I'm just a jack of all trades and master of none. It bothers me that I haven't found the thing that gets me excited and wakes me up with excitement to begin my day.  The thing I do better than most. I'm just ""meh"" about the work. Am I just being unrealistic?
I'm lucky to have a career in cybersecurity and I want to remain in this field. I believe there's something out there I can find that gets me excited.

na9mvx,yonatan777,Which Language/Framework do people think there is the highest demand for and has the least saturated market?," 

I've been a .Net developer for many years and love the technology, but really dont like the majority of jobs I see for .Net. It seems like the market is quite saturated . Also , I'd say a majority of the .Net jobs these days are 50/50 .Net/Angular/React and Azure based DevOps .. There are a lot of demands for low pay and many employers tell me how saturated they are with qualified applicants for these low pay/high demand jobs. I know .Net is considered romantically appealing and so many want to learn it. It is what drove me to learn it in 2002. Although I was a VB6/ MFC programmer prior to it so got into .Net before it became as well known as today. However, I am starting to think this may not a good trait about .Net.. It has this romantic appeal and corporations that use it have unrealistic views about the framework and expectations of those who use it.

Despite Java, for example, being an even larger framework, I have found many jobs in Java are much more focused on specific development needs and realistic demands. Rarely do I see a Java Spring job description that wants you also to be senior DevOps dev, like I do with many .Net jobs. Good luck ever finding a purely back-end .Net developer job, they are basically non-existent.

I am interested in a framework/language that would be more lightweight, allow for more back-end focused development where I could become more specialized in one area of development.  E.g. I hear a lot of DevOps people will do back-end dev with Golang and/or Python which is focused on helping to build and manage microservices.  Having to spend a lot of time with React on top of that is pretty rough, but that is what I am seeing in many .Net jobs.  I feel if i am stuck working a full-stack type of job, I might as well just migrate towards Node and have a full-stack JS framework, rather than having to deal with complexities of two large frameworks.. Also, the demand for Azure DevOps is tough , since my background is mostly AWS and I would prefer a role that is more focus on one discipline (web dev vs DevOps) than having to be full-stack web dev/DevOps dev.",1620772216,t3_na9mvx,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/na9mvx/which_languageframework_do_people_think_there_is/,775,138,2,1483177796,1643,0,0,yonatan777,"

na95ur,RelentlessPeasant,"Struggling with giving myself a ""title""","Hey, so I've been self-studying web development, and programming in general for a year and a half now. I haven't applied for jobs yet, because I'm currently doing my one year of mandatory army service, which is not the point, but I wanted to get that clear. However, I've had 2 employers contact me on LinkedIn to go for an interview, one as a Node.js developer and the other was as a Back-end developer. And this was probably a very needed confidence booster, although I've had to turn them down because of my army service.

My problem is, I have not focused on one tool. Throughout my studying process, I've only focused on getting the fundamentals right along with learning how to build things, no matter what the platform is, nor the tools used to build them.

I've avoided using Angular, React.js, or any other specific framework or library, and stuck with working on all my web projects using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I even avoided using Bootstrap. I have also studied fundamental CS and programming subjects (such as the fundamentals in topics like OS's, Networking, Game Development, Hardware Design, etc.), learned the basics of other languages (C, C#, and Python), and built small things using them, for example, I worked on Linux for more than a year, tackled building a small game in C and did it, worked on small desktop apps using C# and .NET to be familiar with an actual OOP language and a different platform, got introduced to XML, and it gave me a solid ground to work with SVG in a web app I have been working on lately, I also worked on a small Flask project with a friend and helped them debug it and get it live. Note that I've tried to tinker around with all of this just because I want to be a programmer before being a Web developer, which is very important to me.

Back to the Web, I've only been building personal projects, using Node.js for their back ends, along with vanilla JS on the front end. Although I see myself more fit to be a back-end developer, I don't think I know enough to title myself as a specialized ""back-end developer"" yet. I also haven't worked with any specific framework or tool on the front end and I'm not a designer, so I am not sure of that as well. However, I can implement complete designs using HTML and CSS. I have practiced this trying to remake templates I find on the internet by myself and finishing most of them, but I can't actually come up with design ideas myself.

I know I'm ready and capable to get a job once I'm done with this year of service, but the problem is, I don't know what I can call myself or where I specialize in the Web. I'm sure I can build things, I can tackle any problems in a web app, learn the specific tools needed to solve them. I've been through these steps several times and I've completed the apps, but I don't know if this is enough for employers.

na6nko,farts_too_much,Got sent a non anonymous survey to fill out from HR about my first months on the job. What should I put?,"3 months or so ago I joined a mid sized tech company in a developer role. To be honest, my first few months here haven't been that great at all, but I'm burnt out on the job hunting thing and I want to get at least a year under my belt before I leave so it looks OK on the resume. For added context, the company has had a massive amount of voluntary turnover and the company basically has no culture at all. It's very much a ""show up, work, don't socialize, leave"" sterile environment and I believe that has caused a lot of folks to find work elsewhere.

So I got an email from HR where I have to fill out a survey for my job satisfaction. They ask questions about if I like the company culture, how satisfied I am with my job, did the job meet the expectations etc. Then I'm told HR will go over these results with me in a 1 on 1. For even more context, this is the same company that had HR reach out to me directly and asked me to write a good Glassdoor review for them, these people have no shame (I did not leave any review for the record).

So my question is, how do I answer that? If I answer honestly (the company is pretty shit) I'll likely have a target on my back and I'll have to start job hunting again. If I say everything is amazing nothing will change and it will continue being shit until I decide to leave. Sigh.

na6i52,Stoichk0v,Sudden change in work/life balance after probation period validated,"Hello,

Just some context information first : I am sales engineer employed in tech industry. 38 yo, around ten years in the industry, multiple experiences.

I joined a new company some time ago, and at first it felt great : I was given time to onboard, pleased by the solution and everything.

I had a 4 month probation period. After 2 months, it was validated. I was a bit surprised because I had no chance to do actual work, mostly onboarding and training. This is very unusual here. 

Then that's when everything went havoc. Some days after I started to be micromanaged and thrown in endless remote meetings, I am talking 8AM to 9PM, with no break for lunch, grinding poorly led business meetings.

The last weeks I have been working nights & weekend to deliver, and today this was too much when they asked me if I could do some work during a validated day off. 

Problem is : my manager seems to accept that for him also. He is a workaholic, like I have rarely seen. Even more, I cannot change a title on a slide without having remarks, despite me being a senior employee. Everything I do is subject to review and when I take initiatives I am explained I should not do it like that, even if I follow every process in this company. 

I wonder how to handle that. Anyone been in that kind of situation ?",1620764046,t3_na6i52,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/na6i52/sudden_change_in_worklife_balance_after_probation/,719,1199,4,1606737377,1656,0,0,Stoichk0v,"Hello,

na68pc,cfarsoudi,Friend is struggling to figure out what to do with her CS degree,"I have this friend that I met in college who has been struggling to find a job after graduating. She was dealing with some health issues earlier on, so she didn't graduate until her late 20s. By the time she graduated, her GPA was barely eligible for graduation, had no internships or work experience, and she had almost nothing to show on her resume. I worked with her to get some small projects on there to fill it out, but they're nothing impressive. I've been trying to encourage her to work on more in depth projects so she could have more stuff to put on her resume and actually gain some coding/ debugging experience as well, but that doesn't really seem to be an option for her. She seems to expect a company to hire her based on the fact that she has a degree and willingness to learn.

It's been almost been a year and a half since graduation, and she still has no leads. It feels like she has forgotten a lot of fundamentals from not practicing. I think her stuborness to practice programming and work on projects shows that she has little passion in programming, which is totally ok, but she gets really mad whenever I bring that up, understandably so. 

Obviously my friend has to make some adjustments to her attitude and expectations, but what do you guys recommend for someone who has a CS degree and little passion for programming.

na49jg,applyingcompsci,Some EU --> US Relocation Process Questions,"Hi,

&#x200B;

I'm a HS student and EU national that will be attending an EU university next year to study CSE. I've been checking out career paths and such

and I've seen that the easiest way to end up working in the US is to find a company in the EU that has offices in the US and ask for relocation.

The thing is, I can't seem to find much information regarding the actual process, namely:

&#x200B;

1. How hard/competitive it is to get relocated,

2. What type of companies are the best to ask for relocation(I'm assuming FAANG, but I'm wondering if it's equally doable with others)

3. What types of profiles get relocated(i.e years of experience, ability)

4. Does having an MS degree in an American uni help convince companies to start the process,

5. How long does it take to get relocated.

6. How common is it for people to ask for relocations.

na2lph,monkeyshitter,Choosing First Job,"I'm kind of in a weird situation right now and am looking for some input.

I'm a senior CS student and was lucky enough to land my first paid software engineering internship this summer (I've done 2 others but one was unpaid and one was cyber security). The company I'm working at is a large and has offices all over the U.S. but is headquartered local to me. The pay is relatively low ($15/hr) and the company is a not a tech company. I'm not quite sure what fulltime employees make but I believe it's in the range from $50-65k starting.

My issue is that my boss has repeatedly told me that he is hoping to extend my internship and potentially hire me full time after I graduate next fall (technically I'm graduating a semester early) if things go well. While I'm super excited and appreciate this, I can't help but wonder if I should be exploring other options.

I'm worried that starting at a local non-tech company might hurt me down the road when I want to move on. I also know that FANNG-like companies are more open to new-grads than other demographics. I'm concerned that it might be a mistake to just take the first job offered to me (if it is even offered).

The thing is that I have a decent GPA (3.6) but go to a virtually unknown liberal arts college in upstate NY. It might be hard to get my foot in the door coming from a non-target school and one with such low name recognition. However, I have some solid internships and projects on my resume and have made connections with multiple people working at big N tech companies. Also this internship will help me get even more practical experience.

I know it's early to ask this question but it has been on my mind a lot recently and I'm wondering how valid my concerns are. Would I be stupid not to take this job if it is offered? Would I be selling myself short if I did take it?

na0sl3,Gibbo3771,"My employer just told us we would be returning to the office for one day a week and I told them I can't afford to put my 4.5 month old puppy into day care 4x a month, and the response I got has sunk all the compassion and love I ever had for this company and its products","I've been working for this company for 2 years now. I was originally employed  to work remotely as they were a startup with a grand total of 1 other developer.

As the team grew, they got an office in a shared space (hated it, 1 hour commute there, 1 hour back) and I went there every day for about 3 months(?). Then Covid happened and back to remote I go.

They announced the return to office, a different office this time though. This one is closer (40 minutes by foot/bus). We are up to 8 employees now (not including the CEO/CFO), two of them work in **England**. Literally hundreds of miles away.

I honestly can't fathom why they are saying I need to be in the office. I told him straight up (I have always been up front and honest, if not a bit blunt) that I can not afford the £120 in doggy day care per month.

The response was ""That's not my problem, these are the things you have to think about before getting pets"". I did think of them, I've been working and delivering projects on time remotely for 2/3rds of my employment here, why the fuck do I need to be in an office?!

This is a company that I've been putting in 100% into for the past 2 years, working extra hours, going the extra mile. My dog won't be a puppy forever (how the hell can people even afford to have kids?!), but with the tone I doubt a compromise will even be considered.

I've even been rejected a pay rise this year, I am currently sitting on £30k per year, about £4k less than competing jobs and my peers of similar experience.

Our office is in an industrial block. In the winter it's cold as shit, in the summer it's hot as shit, the bathrooms are awful, there is no where to really eat because the breakroom is tiny  and there is a fucking gym next door that blares awful 100bpm dance music all day and slams weights. It also costs me £5 to get here. So in total, this move back to the office is going to cost me £140 more per month.

I am fucking pissed and now have to go through the hassle of dealing with this confrontation next week and I honestly can't be arsed.

I've always read here that ""*don't be loyal and give them everything, because they will take it al*l"" but felt it was different here, but it's not. It's the same.

I'll never work outside of my hours again and I won't touch a single thing outside of my department.

Not my problem

&#x200B;

Yes it's a rant, I need to get it out.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I know this got an overall negative response, but I thought an update would be in order anyway.

First off, thanks to the person(s) who recommended I read over my contract. It actually states that I am indeed fully remote with the possibility of going into the office *one per month* for a company meeting.

I would also like to point out, like another Redditor here has. I am in the UK, we have rights and contracts when it comes to work. They can't just *change their mind* whenever they like. So I have a right to be upset, I put in the time and thought into getting a breed of dog that fits around my working hours and got him as a puppy **because** working remote was what was agreed at my time of employment.

Also to all the people that say ""dog doesn't need daycare"" or ""just leave them at home and get someone to pop in to take them for a walk"". Yeah guys, it's a puppy. They can't just be left alone for 7 hours a day with zero stimulation. There is a perfectly good reason why shelters have a ton of dogs aged between 1 and 2 years old.

na0kzm,Niloc_M,Our director of technology is stepping out of his role and they want me to take over his responsibilities,"Hey,

I have been working at this small software company for about 2.5 years now as a full stack developer (first job after graduating with a CS degree). The company only has four employees and only two of us are developers (the current director of technology and me). It is still a young company so we are still very actively developing the product, which is a web application used by large businesses in their day to day operations.

Yesterday we had a meeting and it was announced that our director of technology is stepping away from his full time position to a more part time/consulting role where he'll only be putting in 10-20 hours a week. Later I was told by our main boss that he and the director of technology talked about how to go about this and the director of technology was adamant that I was capable of filling the role. He mentioned that he needs a few days to put together the numbers but then we'll talk about an increase in compensation since I'll be taking on more responsibilities. I'm not sure if my title would change or not.

I am confident that I can do the job, but I am a little concerned that the compensation increase may not adequately reflect the responsibilities that I'm being given. I am currently being paid below market for the area especially considering I already had a ton of responsibilities, so I'm worried that the new compensation will only really get me up to where I probably should have been in the first place. I have also been in the process of interviewing with a different company in the last few weeks to try to get a better gauge on my market value but I'm still in that process so I haven't received an official offer from them yet to compare against, but from the looks of it I would be paid considerably more at that company.

How do I go about negotiating this if the salary my boss pitches to me is below my expectations? I only have 2.5 years of experience but at the same time they're asking me to fill a role of someone with 20+ years of experience. What is reasonable for me to ask for? Should it be more than a mid level developers salary?

Some more info about the business:

Even though its a young company that could still be considered a startup, I know that we're very stable financially and the last few months have been especially good to us. To my knowledge there are no immediate plans of hiring another person. So in theory with the director of technology taking a step back there should be plenty of funds to add to my compensation...

Only 2 years out of school but web development and coding seems like a cool/rewarding career.

I understand that this will take 8-12 months with a full time job before I can reasonably make a pivot into web development. I’ve started learning through FreeCodeCamp. 

I have a few questions:

Will I be prepared for an entry level job in the industry after completing the courses through this program? 

Do I need a portfolio of side projects I’ve done over these 12 months? 

What is a reasonable starting salary for entry level web development in NYC? (I know I’ll probably be taking a decent pay cut here)

How long is a typical tenure at an entry level position before moving on if internal advancement isn’t attainable?

Originally studied physics at Uni, even went on and did a phd because I was passionate about the topic. Left academia and has been working as a developer in the whole ""Data""-business for the past 6 years. I don't like buzz words but titles have come and gone so much, but just to give an idea of I am doing I have been called things such as data engineer,data scientist, big data develeper and even machine learning engineer etc.... The past 4 years I have been working as an independent contractor (zzp), as I enjoy my freedom.

Unless a fellow colleague in the Netherlands corrects me, the tech industry scene is not great there. So I have mostly worked in Brick and Mortar companies (telco, finance, retail, logitistics, fashion etc..). While covid19 obviously meant externals getting laid off, and I was no exception there, it became also a blessing for my career as a lot of companies are seeking contractors in other countries. This is were I got a taste of working at a tech company, tbh still surprised they were hiring contractors. There is a clear noticeable difference in mentality between tech and brick&mortar people. It was an amazing experience to have such talented and motivated colleagues. More on that later.

Sadly, things are never easy, I was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer a couple of months ago. Unsurprisingly, I had to let go of my current contracts to prioritize my treatment. 

I am about three quarter into the treatment process now. It has been not easy of course. You think you will be the exception, and that you will overcome the side effects, but they hit you like a truck.

Somehow by miracle, I was able to negociate a contract with another tech to start towards the end of my treatment. In the period of my treatment, I was approached as well by two FANG companies for remote permanent. Out of curiosity, I followed the process with one of them and was even invited for online onsite interviews. As the side effects were intensifying, and I stopped the process.

Work has always played a very central role to me. I am very passionate. Being able to improve and push myself to master my craft is very important to me. Cancer, however, is making me question a bit where I want to go with my career.

As I mentionned at the beginning, I worked mostly at Brick and Mortar. While I respect the people I have worked with, I do think B&M are the worst and most depressing places to work at as a developer. I often like to compare IT departments with Coat Hangers. Nice to have in the house, looks fancy and it's fun to display your coats (developers), but of course you rarely wear most of them (i.e. you can easily get away doing nothing for months and nobody will notice nor care). Everybody is different and , yes, some do enjoy the peaceful life of low pressure calm work. In my case, I have always needed action. I spend quite a lot of time initiating a lot of projects while working at these companies. It always felt I was a mule dragging a cart while 3-4 other people would pull in other directions. As you may guess already, I definitely was not the greatest friend with my managers. I do, however, take pride that I worked on some of the most innovative projects. I count myself lucky, despite the fights, that my managers's managers always saw me in high regard and always provided me with great recommendations which allowed me to keep moving forward.

Since the cancer, however, and not being in my twenties anymore, I fear I will not have the energy anymore to fight similar battles. The though of working as contractor again at brick & mortar makes me almost as nauseous as my chemotherapy. I don't think I will always be able to work as an independent contractor with tech companies. Possibly, renouncing my freedom and  taking the opportunity to work as an employee at FANG (Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google) could be interesting, but looking at glassdoor it looks like I would be making less than I am making now (at least if I have a decent year with 10-11 month billeability).  My problem as well is that I am not really interested in working as a manager. I love working as an individual contributor. Bossing people around does not interest me. I want to refine my craft, keep innovating and building exciting stuff. This is one of the main reason I am   less interested in working as a employee. Being an employee feels like you are stuck in some cage where the only way to grow is climbing the ladder. I hate all the politics and petty backstabbing for silly meaningless titles. I take pride in what I create, not whatever non-sensical imaginary title or how many people are sucking up to me.

n9r3ef,Initial_Upstairs_944,Should I take this paycut to convert to FTE?,"I am a W2 contractor (employment taxes paid for by staffing co) who has received a conversion offer that is still a ~20% paycut (ratio of contract to full-time pay is 1.2:1) even after factoring in all major benefits — PTO, insurance, 401k match, and bonus.

So I'm pretty happy with myself and my progress through the  years mainly because I was programming for only 4 years now (since I  started my first studies which I eventually left for my Bachelor of  Informatics degree). Now I'm ending my Bachelor Degree in month or two.  I'm thinking about applying for Master degree in Germany or in some  other country in EU (Netherlands are on my list too :D). I'm from Poland  BTW so it is somewhat a big deal for me while I have really no love for  my country right now and always wanted to see how it is to live in some  foreign country for longer time. But it came to my mind: Did I really  need this masters degree? My studies right now aren't so appealing to  me, I learn much more in my job etc. I have possibility to work remote,  so I could probably just travel and work. What would you do on my  position?

* I have until June 1st (next month) to accept the MS offer

Should I do the MS program or just forget about it and start job hunting ASAP? The reason I didn't start earlier was because I actually *was* taking a legitimate gap year as I fully intended on doing the MS, but now I'm having second thoughts due to cost.

n9pddw,robsticles,Considering leaving a great job for a 10-20% salary increase,"Hi folks

I've gone through a good chunk of r/personalfinance and r/cscareerquestions for insight and the answer to the post title definitely varies. I was hoping I could get some perspectives while I weigh the pros and cons of potentially leaving my current job which I am very comfortable in. 

I'm in the late stages of an interview process for a Solutions Engineering-type position at a large, high-profile tech company. While I do not like to count my eggs before they hatch, I've done this before and put off the planning/consideration until the offer finally came and ended up rushing on the negotiation piece. I've received great feedback throughout the interview process which makes me think that it's definitely appropriate to begin this kind of decision making

Timeline:

2019 - Got laid off from a job that paid 85k 

2019 - Found a job that paid 90k 

2019 - That job ended up not being a great fit at all, found a different job that paid 115k 

2020/2021 - Got a 5k raise to 120k

2021 - Entertaining an opportunity that COULD pay 145-150k if I play my cards right per the feedback I've gotten from the interview process so far. Offer will more than likely start at around 135k per [h1binfo.info](https://h1binfo.info) (roughly a 12% increase)

Current Job:

Pros: Great flexibility with time off and sick days, 30-minute max commute one way, absolutely wonderful coworkers, caring and empathetic management, great team culture, opportunity to learn a little about a whole lot of things (jack of all trades master of none), you are pushed to get 3rd party certifications, literally no micromanaging, respect work/life balance and do not expect work off-hours, and they do not fire people

Cons: Current role does not translate into a career unless you want to go into management for the department, locked into my current role within the company for two years (I'm about a year and a half in), you are pushed to get 3rd party certifications, little flexibility with working hours (day always has to end at 5 no matter how early I start), 50-70% customer-facing which I want to get away from, standing customer engagements which I also want to get away from, generally most of the expected tasks have become tedious/boring 

This job that I'm at is probably tied for the best I've ever had and I've never had this kind of support from a Manager before - I had something of a nervous breakdown while dealing with some substance abuse issues a few months into quarantine. Without any hesitation, he gave me a whole week off and checked in on me to make sure that I was doing well. 

With all of that said it is definitely a difficult choice for me to even consider leaving the company. However...

What I know/been told about the new position:

I will be part of a new department within the company so there is an opportunity to be at the start of something from the ground up (fast-paced start-up style type of growth), flexible working hours, will be about 20% customer work (no scheduled, standing customer meetings only working on tickets), 45-60 minute commute one way, could potentially offer a shuttle to the office (still WFH until further notice, probably until August)

I'm at a point in my life where it would behoove me to make as much money as I can until the next big thing, which is moving out of the country and marrying my fiance. I'm going to a place where 50k USD translates to 200k locally which you can live on very comfortably for about 3-4 years so it would be great to max out the USD earnings. This company that I am applying to also has offices in that country as well. While there might be a possibility for a transfer, there are roles there that I would be qualified for if I had to reapply

With all that said if the current job I was at wasn't almost perfect, this wouldn't be a difficult decision. I've always followed the money throughout my career in tech and it's worked out well so far which is why I'm feeling like I should do the same here. I'm also considering having that big name on my resume as well. But this time is definitely different and I for sure am heavily considering how great management has treated me up to this point.

Looking at TN visa the job listed is ""Conputer Systems Analyst"". Doing some research you basically need to sell yourself and convince that your education and experience is fit for the job. You also need to convince them youre moving back to your home country when your visa expires. 

I will be a new grad with a BSc in Software Development, from a fully online american university.

My goal is to get a software dev/engineering job in NYC, its the closest large city to home with a major tech hub presence.

n9ou0p,PrepRally124,Landed my first paid internship!!,"I’m soo glad that I finally got a job in tech that is paid and it is an internship. I have lurking this subreddit since 2018 and I cant believe my time has come!

My background is that I am graduate from a small college in Canada majoring in CS. I always believed that you needed coop to land internships but I was clearly wrong. I sent over 2000+ applications and went on approximately 50 interviews. In the end I ended up volunteering for a company as a software developer. My CTO saw that I was hard working and putting in 110% of my work and decided to offer a paid position in the company for the summer.  I will be working Software Engineer Intern( though ill be mostly doing QA work hehehe)

My advice, don’t give up. Keep trying because when you give up you’ve admitted defeat. Also if you can’t get an internship or a FT job, work as a volunteer part time, you will make alot of connections and you gain alot of experience. If not you’re into that then work on side projects, they helped alot in making my application look more appealing.

My plan for the future is to get into my masters hopefully , grind Leetcode and DS and Algo and hopefully get another internship or a FT role.

Good luck everyone, you will definitely succeed.

n9nhvl,57GREGG,Advice on Upcoming meeting?,"I have an initial phone screening with a company tomorrow, just want to grab some advice on what to do before the interview?

My main steps i take (which should be changed after 6 interviews and nothing), are for :

Overall ( keep the damn conversation as human as possible and don't try to sound smart like your the next Steve Jobs )

Introduce myself

""My name is BLANK and i'm currently seeking a remote software engineering position. Although that has not always been the case as i have a non-traditional background and decided to make a change back when covid hit and push myself as an individual.""Then go into a little more detail on my background and college. I normally end the conversation with what i enjoy about development ""I really enjoy being able to create, test, and eval production application's""

I really want to refactor it and make it better to wow the interviewer. Any advice on some structure for the ""introduce yourself""?

I normally tend to get past the recruiters but worried that its taken into account when i meet with the engineer and my lack of experience is bad so want to make myself sound better without being too extra.

About the company :

I've researched about the company (they are a restaurant ordering platform that allows the company to view real time feedback on service and more) and i've worked in the hospitality industry so clearly understand the need for real time feedback , quick ordering, and focusing on the user's experience vs getting the order wrong and spoiling their experience.

Any advice on anything i should do before this interviewer? BTW: The position is a Jr Software Engineer. Interview is tomorrow 11:30am Tuesday May 11th. So if you are viewing after then i have had the interview.

TLDR: Interview tomorrow and need some advice on what to look up to WOW the interviewer. Also some advice on how to structure the ""tell me about yourself"".

n9mnr1,Tress__Stress,Is it common to go 6-8 months into your first job without getting any 'ownership' of any features?,"Edit: I started off this post with the intention of asking one thing but it changed somewhere along the way into the entire situation Im in.

I'm a 2020 grad who started his first job in September. My company made all the new grads undergo a couple of months of basic training of things like Python, SQL, AWS etc. I finally joined my team in mid-December and after a couple of weeks of getting permissions, setting stuff up etc, I started getting assigned work from Jan.

&#x200B;

Its been five months now and I have not really done much - the majority of tasks assigned to me are of one of these types:

1. Bugs which have been resolved in other versions of the product, where I basically have to replicate the changes made. A lot of these are assigned to me with the idea that I will be exposed to diff parts of the codebase and get more functional knowledge of the product
2. Minor UI changes
3. Writing of some selenium tests which are pretty basic and generally follow the same format
4. Automation related tasks - run an automation suite, analyze whether all tests passed. If not, raise issues for the ones which failed

To be very honest, I have gone into auto pilot mode the last couple of months. With the pademic still going on and the monotony of wfh, my motivation was completely gone. Back in 2020, I was interning at a 'better' company but due to multiple reasons, one of them being covid, I did not get a full time offer. Recently I had seen folks with < 1 YOE applying to and getting into some top companies which I had deemed unlikely as I thought companies would not be willing to hire someone who is between the 0-1 year mark in experience. But on seeing this, I started leetcoding and stopped putting any effort into my actual job. I had started basically copying the code changes which I needed to replicate without even trying to analyze them, procrastinate on the other work as well.   


I ended up giving a few OAs (Linkedin and a few good local product companies) and did not get through them. On getting some advice from some more experienced people, I am considering staying put until around July -August when I can pass off as a 1 YOE guy and then applying again, and continuing to improve at LC in that time. But now its starting to hit me that it will soon be close to a year without me having done any actual coding and Im not sure what I will say when asked in interviews about my experience. I wanted to get this sub's opinion on this situation:

&#x200B;

Has anyone been in this sort of situation where they were not getting any major work as a new grad and their coding skills suffered as a result?

I am considering applying to other places and am doing leetcode prep on the side. One thing which worries me is what I would say when asked about my contributions at my first company. All I can really say is that I completed my tasks(without being proactive tbh) and delivered requirements on time. Would this be accepted? I see so many people who put on their resumes about what they designed or built etc etc

How do I bring this up with my manager?

n9m03u,BasicCarl,How to ask employer about vacation?,"So today I got a phone call with a verbal offer for the company I recently interviewed with. I was (am) very excited and l told them I accepted. I also mentioned I will be out of town the 13th through the 17th of this month. They said this was no problem since paperwork and a background check will likely take longer. I will be starting the 24th of this month.

My issue is that I forgot to mention that I have a two week vacation scheduled for July 20th - August 3rd. This has been planned since before I even interviewed and I haven't brought it up yet. I want to know if it's a good idea to email the recruiter about this? and how to best word it?

This job offer is more important than this vacation but I have spent some money I won't be able to get back most likely. So obviously I would cancel the vacation it if it's a problem. But is even asking about it going to get my offer revoked? Should I even risk asking? I will also be working remote for the time being I could maybe ask if I can do my work from my vacation destination? Any advice welcomed.

I graduated in 2019 with a degree in CS from a Kansas state school. I began to work at the same company I did my internship with (a very very large private corporation). Ive been there for about two years now and am leading a lot of development and architecture in my group as the lead has moved to a different team so the amount of work I have is substantially more than a year ago. I’m in south central Kansas so cost of living is pretty low. 

I have been getting a lot of recruiters messaging me so I decided to see what was out there in the market. 

After a few interviews, I got an offer from a large consulting company (considered big 4 on the business side). 

Now I want to lay down my situation and see if anyone has any wise words. I don’t have anyone in my personal life that I could speak to and could relate to my situation so I thought I’d ask here. 

Current Compensation: 77k (possible 5k raise by end of this month). 401k matching, full benefits. Full time, salary, rarely work more than 40 hours. I’ve really enjoyed my time here and enjoy the people I work with, although I would like to get out and experience more of the world since I was raised here in Kansas. There is also a strict business casual dress code and working remote or from home is very limited. 

New offer: 95K, full remote, option to work in DC or Austin, TX if I prefer to have an office. Similar benefits although the 401k matching is a bit weaker ($0.25 per dollar up to 6% vs 100%% up to 6%). This gives me the chance to own my life a bit more and flexibility to move to a new city in the future without having to find a new job. 

I am feeling very stressed about this decision and not telling my current employer about the situation. I’m worried that I could do poorly at the new job or be falling behind when at my current company I’m doing extremely well. I am nervous about having the conversation of leaving etc. 

I’ve never made a move like this in my professional career and I would really appreciate advice on whether I should take this offer or any advice anyone else can provide.

Lots of times I’m just learning things on my own or taking courses during work hours and when work does come in, it’s so unfulfilling and uninteresting I want to blow my brains out.

n9ffn2,jordan2422,PIP given to me on 7th month at work without metric explanation or warning. Look for another office or not?,"I'm now on my 7th month with my 2nd team at my current job as a software developer. I moved to this office with the aim to learn more.

PIP - is Performance Improvement Plan. I know that it's given to an employee if he fails to meet the target for a period. 

Today, I was invited to a meeting with no subject which I attended. To my surprise, it wasn't about regularization, instead it was about PIP that I never was warned before.

Our office is a contractor and has clients abroad. During the meeting, my manager simply showed a PIP form and explained that it's being issued to me because I didn't meet the metrics and expectation of client. That's when I started to get confused. ""No specific metrics were discussed to me since I joined"" I thought that I jist need to work on the task assigned to me per sprint.

Some of the metrics/target I saw on the PIP are about ensuring at least >=10 lines of code merged per sprint, ensuring that you avoid getting task carried over to next sprint etc. All of which were never discussed to me since I joined the company. And now, there I was in the meeting being issued a PIP right on my face when I wasn't even oriented about the goals. No warning, no monitoring, just straight PiP that they said I need to acknowledge.

I expressed my confusion and feelings about it to my manager(contractor side) and he told me that they will help and that I just need to get through it. In other words, just accept it. And that they didn't know about those specific metrics of client, which I find a miss on their part. They just told me that my feedback will be communicated and feedback is appreciated.
I got so pissed because I think it is so unjust and unfair to just issue a PIP to an employee when on the other hand it's them who failed to communicate to me what my metrics are. And I'm on my 7th month, not even a year. How the hell would I know those specific targets if they don't identify and ask those from client. There are sprints where there are only UX tasks. (I do backend btw)

Their miss, my record/reputation's expense.

Sorry, I'm a little getting carried away.
Now, I've been thinking that I wouldn't want to stay in an office with that kind of system and management. I'm only on my7th month. In my previous offices, shortest stay was 2.5years.

n9ev5n,Nice_Asaz1380,"Career Changer here, looking for constructive criticism of my plan.","I've spent 10yrs as a cook straight out of high school. Not the life I want. I have accrued a solid amount of savings and want to completely dump it into my plan for school. So here it is...

Step 1: take approximately a year off and basically redo my whole grade 12 curriculum to bring myself up to 90+ average. (The #1 goal is Comp Sci at Waterloo University but am willing to accept an alternative.)

Step 2: Purchase a condo with my girlfriend and float my half of the mortgage with my savings. The reason I want to do this is because I really want to spend 100% of myself to really push myself and discover my limits. I find that work easily derails my progress so I want to just shut it off for a bit and focus purely on the goal at hand. 

Step 3: Get accepted into University and give 100% for the following 4 years while spending purely out of my savings. Maybe accept summer jobs for supplemental income.

I feel the Condo is a very important part of this puzzle because I will know that even if I fail I will still have a sense of progress since it will (In theory) be gaining equity rather than dumping into rent. 

My living expenses I've capped at about 1700/month = 20k/yr = 80k/4yrs. Lets say 100k for 4yrs of living expenses and then approx 50k for schooling fees.

n9dsjc,myth-ran-dire,"Got an offer to join a small, recently seeded startup. How do I negotiate a competitive paycheck with little to no context?","The work will be in video analytics from live video streaming, and the startup seems to have recently been given seed funding. Headcount is +/-10 persons, likely fewer. 

The interview was an exploration of my technical background and research work in ML and CV as a grad student. I was given a take home assignment trying to demo an open source piece of software which I managed to complete, and was then given an offer to come aboard. 

I get to pick my title, which will likely be along the lines of Applied ML or Computer Vision Enginner. I have no idea how to negotiate a competitive paycheck in this situation since I only have a faint idea of how much their initial funding is, and only a guesstimate of the headcount.

The interview was an exploration of my technical background and research work in ML and CV as a grad student. I was given a take home assignment trying to demo an open source piece of software which I managed to complete, and was then given an offer to come aboard. 

I get to pick my title, which will likely be along the lines of Applied ML or Computer Vision Enginner. I have no idea how to negotiate a competitive paycheck in this situation since I only have a faint idea of how much their initial funding is, and only a guesstimate of the headcount.

n9dibo,periashu,What CS specialization should one learn to earn some extra money by freelancing?,"I have been thinking to learn some CS specialization.

\- Pay per hour should be good and there should be a steep increment as I become more skilled

\- Should be interesting so that I look forward to learning that skill and do not back out in between, that's subjective but feel free to include your biases

n9adg9,paper_squirell,A Rant And Could Really Use Some Advice - At A Crossroads In My Career,"TL;DR - Coming from IT and working in first DevOps role and it's a nightmare. I'm absolutely lost on where to go from here.

To start, I'm in Canada so I don't know what it's like to be able to apply to hundreds of jobs a week. I don't really have that opportunity where I live.

I'm a little over 3 years in the industry at this point. I worked at an MSP to start. Worked up from the help desk to a project based role and landed a DevOps position 8 months ago. It took time to land this role. I dedicated a lot of personal time to studying, getting certified (Azure Administrator), and working on personal projects.

Things started out ok. I've worked a lot with AWS, Terraform, GitLab for pipelines, a ton of bash scripting, collaborating with devs. I've honestly learned a lot and have done some really cool things with Terraform that I'm proud of but it's really turned out to be a nightmare overall.

This company is about 50 employees total, been around for about 10 years, and I'm the sole DevOps person there. This is my first DevOps position and I was brutally upfront about my skills and experience but showed a willingness to learn which helped me land this role. Here's some issues I'm having:

* First and foremost, the CEO is a bit nuts. He singles people out in chat and asks things like ""Why did you do this?"" ""Why didn't this person catch this?"" anytime something goes wrong. He flips out anytime there is any issues whatsoever, dropping F bombs in chat when something happens. He micromanages everyone. He'll directly message me repeatedly all throughout the day asking me to look into whatever so happened to cross his periphery at that time which he's now deemed critical. I don't get clear instructions on requirements from him at all.
* I spoke with my manager about the CEO micromanaging me and he has backed off a little bit recently, but it's still there, and there are so many other problems with this person that just make it really hard to work with him.
* The CEO ""doesn't do"" tickets, any message received from him in chat is good enough and I should drop everything I'm doing to look into whatever he's asking and most of the time it's way above me. I can't communicate with him through tickets either, I need to chase him down in chat anytime I need clarification on something because he never answers.
* We have project managers that are absolutely useless. Everything is critical, everything needs to be done by end of day, no clear instructions from them ever.
* Developers never stop working. This especially includes the CEO. I receive messages from him at 3 AM asking for my thoughts on things, or asking me to fix a deployment he messed up, because despite the fact I've done multiple personal calls with him to walk him through the deployment process, and written detailed documentation complete with screenshots, he still circumvents it, looks for shortcuts, messes things up, then flips out when everything breaks in the middle of the night because he decided to deploy to production.
* My role isn't clearly defined to anyone else. Everyone thinks I'm the administrator of every single system we have and service we use. Anytime there's the slightest issue with anything I need to drop what I'm doing and fix it. It wouldn't be so much of a problem, but we have like 50+ random EC2 instances that were set up before my time and there is no documentation for any of it. I would love to clean this up, reduce systems, find better ways to run them that's more inline with best practices but I'm honestly just firefighting all day with developers and random other things that get assigned to me.
* I have no time to really dive into some other things I would like to help grow as a DevOps Engineer. There are so many tools and processes I would love to research and attempt to look into but honestly with the way it's been with the CEO who doesn't listen, doesn't bother using processes I've set up, flips out when there's problems, I've just lost all motivation and desire to even try implementing anything else or improving anything.
* I've been volunteered as the head of all security policies and runbooks, despite the fact I'm not actually writing anything at all it's being done behind the scenes without my involvement yet they put my name on documents.
* No documentation for anything except for what I've wrote for the processes / pipelines I've developed. I'm coming from IT and have a solid background in documentation, it's something I've always placed a great deal of importance with.
* No monitoring aside from some pretty useless CloudWatch alerts / dashboards we have set up. I would love to really dive into this area, and load testing as well, but see my point above regarding the CEO. I've honestly just lost all motivation to start on anything like this because of him.
* No leads. No code reviews. Everything is under the birds eye view of the CEO. There are people who direct deployments, but they're not developers. There are so many issues with deployments I don't even know where to start.
* Devs connect to production databases for development.
* Things are way too fast. I'm talking deployments to production causing issues, anything I ever work on needs to be done ASAP as well. I'm not part of any discussions or meetings outside of the daily standups which are a joke.
* Daily standups are absolutely useless.

I'm absolutely lost on where to go from here.

To start, I'm in Canada so I don't know what it's like to be able to apply to hundreds of jobs a week. I don't really have that opportunity where I live.

I'm a little over 3 years in the industry at this point. I worked at an MSP to start. Worked up from the help desk to a project based role and landed a DevOps position 8 months ago. It took time to land this role. I dedicated a lot of personal time to studying, getting certified (Azure Administrator), and working on personal projects.

Things started out ok. I've worked a lot with AWS, Terraform, GitLab for pipelines, a ton of bash scripting, collaborating with devs. I've honestly learned a lot and have done some really cool things with Terraform that I'm proud of but it's really turned out to be a nightmare overall.

This company is about 50 employees total, been around for about 10 years, and I'm the sole DevOps person there. This is my first DevOps position and I was brutally upfront about my skills and experience but showed a willingness to learn which helped me land this role. Here's some issues I'm having:

* First and foremost, the CEO is a bit nuts. He singles people out in chat and asks things like ""Why did you do this?"" ""Why didn't this person catch this?"" anytime something goes wrong. He flips out anytime there is any issues whatsoever, dropping F bombs in chat when something happens. He micromanages everyone. He'll directly message me repeatedly all throughout the day asking me to look into whatever so happened to cross his periphery at that time which he's now deemed critical. I don't get clear instructions on requirements from him at all.
* I spoke with my manager about the CEO micromanaging me and he has backed off a little bit recently, but it's still there, and there are so many other problems with this person that just make it really hard to work with him.
* The CEO ""doesn't do"" tickets, any message received from him in chat is good enough and I should drop everything I'm doing to look into whatever he's asking and most of the time it's way above me. I can't communicate with him through tickets either, I need to chase him down in chat anytime I need clarification on something because he never answers.
* We have project managers that are absolutely useless. Everything is critical, everything needs to be done by end of day, no clear instructions from them ever.
* Developers never stop working. This especially includes the CEO. I receive messages from him at 3 AM asking for my thoughts on things, or asking me to fix a deployment he messed up, because despite the fact I've done multiple personal calls with him to walk him through the deployment process, and written detailed documentation complete with screenshots, he still circumvents it, looks for shortcuts, messes things up, then flips out when everything breaks in the middle of the night because he decided to deploy to production.
* My role isn't clearly defined to anyone else. Everyone thinks I'm the administrator of every single system we have and service we use. Anytime there's the slightest issue with anything I need to drop what I'm doing and fix it. It wouldn't be so much of a problem, but we have like 50+ random EC2 instances that were set up before my time and there is no documentation for any of it. I would love to clean this up, reduce systems, find better ways to run them that's more inline with best practices but I'm honestly just firefighting all day with developers and random other things that get assigned to me.
* I have no time to really dive into some other things I would like to help grow as a DevOps Engineer. There are so many tools and processes I would love to research and attempt to look into but honestly with the way it's been with the CEO who doesn't listen, doesn't bother using processes I've set up, flips out when there's problems, I've just lost all motivation and desire to even try implementing anything else or improving anything.
* I've been volunteered as the head of all security policies and runbooks, despite the fact I'm not actually writing anything at all it's being done behind the scenes without my involvement yet they put my name on documents.
* No documentation for anything except for what I've wrote for the processes / pipelines I've developed. I'm coming from IT and have a solid background in documentation, it's something I've always placed a great deal of importance with.
* No monitoring aside from some pretty useless CloudWatch alerts / dashboards we have set up. I would love to really dive into this area, and load testing as well, but see my point above regarding the CEO. I've honestly just lost all motivation to start on anything like this because of him.
* No leads. No code reviews. Everything is under the birds eye view of the CEO. There are people who direct deployments, but they're not developers. There are so many issues with deployments I don't even know where to start.
* Devs connect to production databases for development.
* Things are way too fast. I'm talking deployments to production causing issues, anything I ever work on needs to be done ASAP as well. I'm not part of any discussions or meetings outside of the daily standups which are a joke.
* Daily standups are absolutely useless. The project managers just talk about what's being deployed for 5 mins, while everyone else sits in silence in the call, but then I get singled out and asked what I'm working on and when it will be done. No one has any idea of what I'm talking about and it just feels so awkward.

n99c59,SageTG,Non-CS Grad Seeking Guidance for Career Path,"I am looking to enter the Software Development scene. I have my BBA in Marketing, but originally wanted to get a degree in CS however this never happened due to my lack of knowledge of how college really worked (First Gen Graduate). I got my general undergrad coursework done at a local community college and then transferred to a state college, during this process I found out that if I wanted to get a degree in CS, that I would basically have to retake much of my general coursework as it was going to require that I get much of the foundational coursework done despite already having my associate degree. So essentially I was looking at going to school for another 3-4 years to get a CS degree vs continuing with a business degree in 2 years. Due to financial/time constraints, I went the BBA route (and highly regret this decision).

Two years ago I graduated with my BBA and have been unable to find anything professionally in the field. I am about to turn 25 years old and am feeling like if I want to make a career/field change, now is the time to do it. It doesn't help I'm not really interested in Marketing, but I am interested in software dev as I feel that it would be much more in my spectrum of interests and fit me as a person better. I have a little self-taught knowledge of python/html/css/js, but nothing significant enough to gain employment. My hope would be to utilize something of my Marketing degree, potentially the UX/UI knowledge that I gained during my studies.

Just some background info: I am married and my wife and I both have income, I would be able to work part-time and attend school/camp if the opportunity arose. She makes enough income to support us both if necessary for a period of time. I live in Arkansas, while there are not a vast amount of employment opportunities in my city, we live pretty close to Little Rock which has some SE jobs posted pretty regularly, though we would be willing to move if necessary. 

My question is this, what would be the best route in my case to reach employment in the SE field?

1.) I have been accepted to my local community college for pursuing a second bachelor in CS, my situation is similar to when I was in college the first go around, I will require all of the foundational classes and since this would be my second bachelor, I would be paying out of pocket/getting loans to pay. Either way, I assume it would be helpful to take some of the intro to CS classes there.

2.) Should I seek a masters degree in CS? There is a college here that offers a ""Master of Computer and Information Science"" degree online and though it prefers students who have a CS background, it does allow for non-cs majors to apply after taking a couple of pre-req courses. This option seems like a good choice, but I get unsure when I consider the fact that I most likely will be lacking a lot of the core foundational knowledge of CS.

3.) I've also considered attending a coding camp though I am a little weary of them. I've looked into Hack Reactor/App Academy/Coding Dojo. I like the idea of getting instant industry applicable skills, but I've also heard/seen some sort of shady stuff with some of the Bootcamps. I also wouldn't be able to lump sum pay for something like this so would need to consider the different financing options.

n95osk,TradeLow2729,Should I tell my manager about my two withdrawn/incomplete master’s degrees?,"
Hello all. I recently got a great job, but am getting anxious about one thing. I never told any of the interviewers about two graduate degrees that I withdrew from. One was due to lack of interest (which I realized later) and another one was due to classes going online. The resume I applied with only lists my bachelor’s degree and I was offered this job based on the submitted resume. We never spoke about graduate school, and I didn’t bring it up myself.

Hello all. I recently got a great job, but am getting anxious about one thing. I never told any of the interviewers about two graduate degrees that I withdrew from. One was due to lack of interest (which I realized later) and another one was due to classes going online. The resume I applied with only lists my bachelor’s degree and I was offered this job based on the submitted resume. We never spoke about graduate school, and I didn’t bring it up myself. They have also successfully completed my background check.

n952ld,rookinn,Non-academic CS jobs post-PhD (UK),"Hey everyone. I'm a PhD student coming to the end of my PhD at a good University in the UK. When I chose the PhD, I was set on academia as a career, but like many people, I've realised I absolutely hate it. I'll finish the PhD, but then I want to jump ship. I wish I did sooner. 

My issue is that I just don't know *what* opportunities there are. Specifically, what **non-academic** jobs do people do after their PhD? 

My PhD was in HCI and Data Science; specifically applying unsupervised learning to an accessibility problem. I'm very comfortable with the accessibility side of things, but I don't think I know enough maths for a true Data Science job. 

I've had past internship experience as a software developer, but I've missed out on three years on paid software development work. That said, I have coded quite a lot for the PhD. Would I still be looking at a junior position if I went this route? 

Ideally, I was hoping to find a non-academic job where I could still utilise the skills and experience of my PhD. Any ideas?

n94apz,Angebracht,Director of Eng gave me surprisingly poor feedback. Should I escalate to VP?,"I'm a Senior Engineer. My team's manager got moved to another team and my lead got promoted to manager. The lead put in his 2-weeks notice, so our team is basically manager-less. This is why our Director of Engineering is managing us right now.

I've been working at this company for 8 months and had my first performance review comprised of nothing but great feedback. 

I had my first two 1-1s with the director, the first of which was very casual, but the next was a shocker. I was called out on:

1. Having too many PRs open, closed, and in draft
2. Having too many commits
3. Too many comments from others in my PRs
4. Pushing commented code & code with git artifacts in it

In my defense:

1. Since the start of the quarter, my team has reprioritized a lot of work, and there hasn't been a discussion about what to do with the work that we all started. Also, I open a draft PR the moment I make my first commit on a branch. I do this for visibility, and in case someone needs to take over the work.

2. I also commit a lot. Commits are my safety net. I use `git reset` tremendously throughout the day to go back to different states in the code I'm working on.

3. The director mentioned that he expects senior engineers to have very little chatter on their PRs. They should be ready to merge with very little discussion. What he failed to recognize that were almost all of the comments on my PRs are from Hound, our linter. Rather than linting before pushing, I actually enjoy waiting for Hound's comments and fixing them afterward.

4. Here I made a mistake. I've been forced to comment out code recently in some of our microservices as a temporary fix while working locally. I forgot to uncomment the code before pushing to GitHub. The director went through my commits and saw some commit messages like ""uncomment code"", ""remove commented block"", and reprimanded me for that.

I've been an engineer for more than 10 years and no one has called me out on any of this. This is how I like to work. I don't see a real problem here. 

I can squash my commits, lint locally, and stay blocked when services aren't working on my machine. But I'm mostly concerned about why this director is calling out this bullsh*t.

I spoke to my former manager, and he said it'd just be easier to appease him. But it feels like the director is looking for a reason to let me go by finding incompetencies in my performance. I do not want to work in fear or with paranoia.

Should I have a chat with the director's manager to ask about the feedback and what he suggests I do about it?

&nbsp;

**BONUS**

Another reason I think this feedback may be in bad taste is because of this:

We've recently been given one of those typical sexual harassment training assignments which were to be complete in a month (due, say, May 15). On my day off last week, I got an email from the director saying, ""I know you're OOO, but we need you to finish the sexual harassment training **today**."" After checking my email, it was still due May 15th, not May 8th. I completed it, of course (to shut him up), but that still leaves me with one question: Why would this guy message me on my day off with such urgency to complete something that was not even due?

n92alk,usr3nmev3,This field scares me,"I'm a CS/math sophomore at a decent (top 100) state school and between how hellish this internship application season was, and all of the posts on this sub, I'm super worried about sitting job-less for ages now.

Is this field just impossible to get a job now as a new grad? I got lucky this spring/summer with an alum of a scholarship program I'm a part of and thankfully have an internship at a startup, but I'm 99% sure I'm not going to be given a return offer as the offer seemed a bit like ""here's something for your resume as a favor but we only need crazy good ppl right now so don't count on a re-hire"" and the other engineers at the startup are all ex-Big N with loads of experience. All of my contributions are to an open-source product, which is nice, and I have a good bioinformatics research portfolio with a few publications, but I honestly don't like school/classwork very much and don't know if I want to do grad school. Can you even get hired with a BS nowadays?

My GPA is a 3.6 at the moment (almost exclusively from starting projects way too late (one class had assignments due at 8am, and I don't think I started a single one before 4am); the only reason I didn't fail classes was due to exams being worth like half the grade) and I have some Cs from this past year (though A's outside of Zoom classes).

My GPA is a 3.6 at the moment (almost exclusively from starting projects way too late (one class had assignments due at 8am, and I don't think I started a single one before 4am); the only reason I didn't fail classes was due to exams being worth like half the grade) and I have some Cs from this past year (though A's outside of Zoom classes).

n90rqu,Ashyia,Need Guidance to Pick between two Support IT roles," Hey Everyone,

I was recently (mid April) Laid off my L1 position where I was contractually working as an L1 Technical Support with a Cloud Project/Process Integration for one of biggest companies in the workspace for a period of one year. I was very much bothered by lack of interest from the management to promote from within despite people working crazy hours or outworking every other colleague. Also for note, this is my only IT experience.

I followed this subreddits as well as [r/ITCareerQuestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) guidance on Resumes, interviews, salaries, career progressions and other.

Because of that I found myself with two offers in two differing companies. I was not able to decide which one to follow with since.

**Company A.) Graduate Technical Support Specialist**  
27.500 Euro a year \~ 25 days off \~ no other benefits.

The Company provides software akin to Mobility Management and other things. The type of work as L1 support will allow me to tackle any issues as L1's take full ticket ownership, so if there is a very difficult ticket I can work on it to try and solve if its not over my head.

This will make me be able to do a work that I enjoy in stable office hours and work with corporate clients who know what they're doing to some degree. I can also work outside of working hours to work on my specific ticket. There's no HelpDesk or anything of the sort so they do not handhold you and wave numbers and quotas above your head.

Because of nature of the company I think the progress within it will be slow, but they use different interesting technologies and focus on networking a lot which I could apply in day-to-day basis.

If not for benefits + School which I will explain below I would chose this one.

**Company B.)** **Customer Support Specialist**  
32.000 Euro a year +5% p/a bonus \~ 25 days off full dental + health cover for me&fam + other benefits

This Corporation deals with GRC and in the last year they have opened a new customer support hub that will be the only support hub globally. They use random shifts with new employee logging in on every hour to ensure constant coverage and the job is being done via HelpDesk where the clients call to the customer support representatives.

They have again and again highlighted that they want technically gifted people to be selected from L1 candidates within about half a year so they can fill up tens of new positions as once again they opened this support hub semi recently so those positions are being made/waiting to be filled.

They will be looking at numbers and I need to be by my station 24/7 as it often happens with HelpDesk types of scenarios. Also they look at metrics and it scares me a lot because I would love to help people to the best of my ability instead of pushing them out asap.

Also, those strange working hours would more easily allow me to finish my Software Dev Undergrad where I miss only three classes that need to be taken during the day AND I need to get my dental work done.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I have about 25k saved so I'm not in the worst place monetarily but I'm not sure if I want to take the jump into a work I could potentially hate for half a year where I will know what's what or start looking elsewhere.

The first Job is more interesting but has lower salary and benefits, as well as possibly much slower progress, but I would enjoy it more and it would be more of technical challenge. The second I will be stressing over metrics over months and hoping they pull me over for something more technical than learning product from 'the kitchen', while simultaneously they provide better benefits/pay and perhaps a career opportunity.

Sorry if I'm rambling, I have gotten zero sleep at night over this and thank you everyone for weeks of supporting people here which helped me in turn as well.

n8yvrf,changexd,Where should I go now as a backend Developer?,"Hello guys, I am a self-taught web developer, I started learning front-end at the end of last year, I've landed two jobs as a front-end dev with REACT, both of the jobs were really bad(on the company policy part, one of them was against my rights), after those two jobs, I soon realized I am more interested in the backend development, so after quitting, I studied a month of basic backend knowledge and then landed an internship as a backend engineer in a start-up.

During the internship, though my position was called ""backend engineer"", but my duty was actually using AWS CDK to do IAC for our service, I had a great time learning cloud services and knowledge about internet, and the crew was really nice to me. But because of the company's lack of budget, they had to let go all the devs including me. After this short but awesome experience, I was almost certain that I want to be a backend Dev in the future, so I started to develop my own side project.  I am an admin in an English study group and we hold events every week, I decided to created a web app to optimize the registration process so I started develop it with something I haven't tried out yet. 

Right now the first version of my app is done on the backend, but because of my friend (she's in charge of UI designing), my side project is not ready to be deployed yet, so I thought maybe I could demonstrate my backend code and get into the job market.

If I should learn something else, where should I go? should I keep optimizing my backend service, or just keep learning new things?

I've been considering maybe getting a AWS certificate, but I really don't know if it helps since $150 is quite expensive for me at the moment..

n8yp7e,theeburneruc,Fresh CS Grad that does not know which doors I have opened for myself,"As someone who has just recently graduated from a CS bachelors program, I have no idea what benefit I have over someone who graduated from, say, only a bootcamp (all else being equal), and I have been having a hard time finding the answer to this question. The closest answer I have gotten is that 'bootcamp grads usually can't apply to embedded entry level jobs.' (No hate to bootcamp grads though. All respect for anyone trying to hustle to make something of themselves in this world.)

I have heard so much rhetoric about the different types of jobs available to SENG and CS grads, and how those grads don't make 'software stacks'(MERN, MEAN, etc.) their main selling point as a bootcamp grad might. I have heard that once you start defining youself by these stacks, then that usually means you are a web developer. I don't want to become a web developer at the end of the day, but I don't know what to look for in an entry level job description that will keep me off that path.

What I am trying to point out, is that there seems to clearly be some distinction about the doors that a CS degree can open, but looking at the market and job ads in Canada, I can't seem to see that distinction in entry level positions. Either the job ads are asking you to be familiar in some software stack and the job is web-dev related, or the experience and tech required is so absurd that I find it hard to believe that any fresh grad would have that experience. I have only checked linkedin job ads though. 

What kind of entry jobs should I be looking for as a fresh CS grad (and as such, are available to me as a fresh grad), where I would generally not be competing with bootcamp grads? By this I mean, what search filters should I be using to find such positions, or what should I look for in job descriptions to keep me away from jobs heavily applied to by bootcamp grads?

n8wnvb,BigMeachSlinger,Can I get an entry level job with no internship?,"Hi all,

I am currently a CS major and a senior in standing. I switched from biology to software engineering the end of my sophomore year, so I was very behind and in order to graduate on time and to save me thousands of dollars (from taking extra semesters) I took about 3 summer classes each summer on top of the usual 4-5 classes during a normal semester. I am about to graduate soon, but since I have been rushing and catching up with the large amounts of classes I needed to take in a quick time, I've had no time for internships or any real world situations.

I am currently a CS major and a senior in standing. I switched from biology to software engineering the end of my sophomore year, so I was very behind and in order to graduate on time and to save me thousands of dollars (from taking extra semesters) I took about 3 summer classes each summer on top of the usual 4-5 classes during a normal semester. I am about to graduate soon, but since I have been rushing and catching up with the large amounts of classes I needed to take in a quick time, I've had no time for internships or any real world situations.

n8vsdp,HandoCho222,Apply For SDE role after one or two yr of exp,"Hi,

I recently got offered to work in a not very reputable insurance company as a SDE. Due to COVID and lack of experience concern as well as I am not ready for leetcode or tech interview ect. Could I just work in the company for a year and start applying for SDE I role in bigger companies like FAANG or maybe other companies?  The major concern I have is that companies will just not considered me as they see I already have a year of exp under my belt and ask me to apply for SDE II role, which I deemed to be harder to pass the interview.

The reason I want to apply for SDE is because of the lower-expectation in the interview, and I then can work my way up

n8vcii,subatomiccrepe,In shameless need of pep talk,"Hello fine people of reddit. This is going to be an explanation of my situation with a friendly request of pep talk/advice at the end. 

Bit of background: I graduated 4 years ago with a CS-lite degree. 
It's focus being on networking and security with a side of information management. It taught me the fundamentals of how to troubleshoot effectively, think critically, and most importantly self teach. Now due to my youthful foolish college ways I graduated with a not so attractive GPA (2.7 but whose counting). As such I pounced on the first job offered which ended up being entirely SQL based. Though I had exposure to SQL it wasn't something I had known in depth. Despite this the requirements for the job were low as was the pay. (I'm not trying to sound ungrateful, it remains one of the biggest pride points for me though now being slightly seasoned I am aware what the standards for the industry are.)


Fast forward a couple years, I am still in the same city I moved to for the job. I have established friends and a girlfriend I'm very happy with, things are nice. (Enter life and uncertainty) The small software company I work for gets bought out and recent restructurings have made me want to look elsewhere.


My personal problem is that I've been on a SQL only diet for about 4 years now and getting mixed messages from the internet as to the viability of that skillset long-term. My preferences for work I have found are being back of house interfacing with customers as little as required though I can do it when necessary and get complimented on my people skills. What I want to do isn't being a BA or manager-type however it's to be a dev/software engineer. I know I need a real scripting/programming language to move into that but it's all so daunting. I've been saying for a year now I'm gonna learn C# (my shop is .NET) but have not nearly but in enough hours to even grasp the fundamentals.


In all honesty half the reason I'm even looking towards other jobs and at my career is I don't want to be stuck with the legacy doom projects all my colleagues are leaving me with. I have a general sense of what I want and now have urgency but I simply lack the skills to make it happen. Do I do leetcode? Do I get back to school to get a CS degree? Bootcamp? There's so many options and it's overwhelming me into a mode where I do nothing and simply try not to think about it.

n8ujcc,progmr_inneed,Feeling baited and switched. Looking for opinions on new job.,"Hello. So just like a lot of other people I was on the look for a new position for a while (pandemic kind of hit me hard). I lost my job found contract work and I was out of work for a little while at the beginning of the year. Two weeks ago I started a new position after two technical conversation interviews. I was offered a new position and my gut feeling was to hold out and keep applying. I did not follow my gut feeling and ended up accepting it. Here is the part where I feel a bit baited.
     During my initial conversation I was told this position would be on site and that the team was currently commuting to the location of the client (kind of far from the main office). I was told that there were other developers working on the project actively. On the day that I start I am told no one has started on that assignment and it may not even happen. My current assignment is getting up to speed with a technology (AWS) I have not worked with for the potential opportunity to work with a client. I've done a little background on their past teams conversations and it seems like a lot of people left last year due to no new projects. I feel like I am being benched already, I've talked with managers about how better I can spend my time day to day. The conversations have not really gone anywhere. I'm currently trying to look for other positions to keep myself ready in case of the worst case, but I wanted another opinion.

n8s5x6,Regular-SFW,Project/Program Manager to software development,"I'm currently in Program Management (I am currently the PMO Manager) and am tired of the project management world. I ended up here by unfortunately chasing money and authority. I was chasing the dream of executive management, but now that I am working daily with VPs and C-level people I realize it is nothing but massive problem after problem, politics, and long hours (evenings and weekend). I also realize my job has too much responsibility, too much stress, and is too people oriented. I think about my work 24/7 - I wake up in the night thinking about it.  That said there are tons of perks with my job, I have complete freedom over what I do each day (it is 100% up to me what I do - sometimes this drives me nuts) and no one is watching me work (I'm supposed to be watching others work). Every now and then I get into incredibly interesting initiatives and see first hand how the business is run from the top level. But I just can't see myself doing this for another 20 years.

When I look back on my university scores I realized that my best grades were in programming. I loved programming, and was good at it, but I was always afraid it would be flooded with cheap labour and it wouldn't continue to pay well. Now that I am in a management position I can clearly see that will never happen - the quality from offshore firms is dumpster-tier and we only leave the most basic menial programming jobs to offshore. (sorry to my offshore friends- every now and then I meet one of you that is rockstar-tier).

All this said - has anyone else been in my position? Did you make the jump and how did it go? I'm afraid I'm going to miss the massive freedom I have in my position, the direct access to upper management for mentorship, the high pay ($125K+ base in a non- tech hub). That said I would love love love to have someone just tell me what to do and I can pop in some earbuds and sit down and code away in peace. I am not a social person, but I'm also not a recluse - I enjoy talking with people and making friends (something that went up in smoke once I got my first management post). But for the most part I am happier to be working solo.

My degree was a mix business/information technology, so I already have a base of programming, database, systems analysis -  I'm not starting from zero. Plus I've been around the IT world for 15 years. I've done hundreds of interviews and I can interview really well. I am thinking of going Python + Javascript + SQL route to build a baseline full stack skillset. I know html/CSS already. My biggest concern is getting a position that I can learn in.

Two weeks ago, I started working on my portfolio since I recently graduated. Let's just say that I didn't take the traditional approach.

My portfolio starts off as being a CLI where users can enter certain commands. This is just a front, and entering a command will prompt them to switch to GUI mode because of some obscure error. Then the actual portfolio appears. Everything can be seen without scrolling as I have used a lot of GSAP to animate elements into/out of view.

\- Give a broad overview of the project.  
\- Talk about the most noteworthy stuff during the development period (I get rather technical here)  
\- Show some illustrations  
\- Rinse and repeat

n8p8r4,Sophia7X,Transitioning from non CS PhD to software engineering?,"Hi, I have a Bachelor's in chemistry from an Ivy League institution, and will be receiving my PhD in chemistry from another Ivy League institution next year. However, I doubt those degrees will mean much in computer fields 😄. I am primarily working in health sciences-related chemistry (ie therapeutics) so it's not like my math is exceptionally strong— though I have taken multivar calc and linear algebra in college. After spending so many years in the lab, I realized that I don't really want to be a chemist for the rest of my life, and I'm not at all interested in staying in labwork. I also strongly dislike academic culture. And I much prefer to work at a computer.


Right now I'm working through The Odin Project, which gears you up for webdev. I'm not that entirely interested in webdev as a career, but from what I read, it is easier to get a job in as self-taught. As a chemist, I enjoy brainstorming solutions and thinking about troubleshooting issues but I don't actually enjoy the physical labor of chemistry (I'm not interested in working with statistics so thats why I have ruled out cheminformatics and data science related to health sciences).


So,  I think I would be into software engineering but the barriers of entry seem much higher. And I have been in school so long, IDK if I want to go back just for a CS degree lol. I don't mind self learning at my own pace though. Or  online Master's are even worth it?  My plan is to finish The Odin Project (Ruby on Rails pathway), do some projects, then learn C/C++ and read a couple computer science books (like on DSA) but then what?  How to translate webdev projects into software engineering skills and demonstrate competence to land a job in software engineering?

n8gsa5,itsyaboii7,How to tell your boss ML isn’t magic?,"I started working for this company in October and was hired as a new grad.  After 4 months our company decided to make a ML team (which was being work on by contractors for the last 2 years). 

The team was my self and Jack (fake name). I was a passionate new grad who worked in some ML before (mostly game related), jack was a phd candidate who specialized in the particular thing we were doing.

After 1 month Jack put in his two weeks (but they let know go that day) because he got an offer at a bigger company. In my opinion he quit because there was way to many expectations from him for how much little time he had. I just felt that my boss didn’t understand how ML development works.

After 1 month Jack put in his two weeks (but they let know go that day) because he got an offer at a bigger company. In my opinion he quit because there was way to many expectations from him for how much little time he had. I just felt that my boss didn’t understand how ML development works.

n8bais,boxthrow101,Moving away from traditional engineering into tech.,"Hi everyone.

I've just graduated from uni with a mech eng. degree and have just started my grad role at one of the top construction companies here in Australia.

After the past 4 months or so I've come to realise that the work here is definitely not aligned to my skills, interests and passions. The work is more project management based and hasn't really allowed me to delve into technical/analysis work which has led to me looking into software/tech as a potential career change. That being said my salary is above average for a graduate engineer, given the workload will become more intense as I progress.

After enrolling and making progress on a beginner Python course from Udemy (which I've been really enjoying) I've been heavily considering my options on how to make this potential transition.

I've dm'd a few individuals within this community regarding this, and have gotten excellent advice, but I would like to hear a more general consensus (if possible) regarding my situation.

At the moment I'm trying to spend my free-time both at work and at home to learn programming and any relevant skills.

The biggest concern I have is how and when I can make the transition into working within the tech space, with software dev more specifically.

My current plan is to do whatever I can on the side, and look out for any potential opportunities whilst continuing with this 2 year program for ATLEAST the next year.

Some questions I have to the wider community more specifically:

Will the next year be enough to learn programming, upskill and complete projects to a level enough for entry-level roles in the space?
Would it be more important to go back to Uni and get a relevant comp sci degree (would be about 2 years given my free electives and such are eaten by my mech eng. courses) to help in my learning and garnering a formal qualification
I've considered doing an online masters degree in something like data science or cyber security (which I can complete whilst working) but I'm not sure how relevant these could be for programming as a whole + it would require some prior knowledge I'd assume
I do know that my current role will become more intense as I progress through the project lifecycle and become more involved with longer days/hours leaving less free-time for study which is why I'm considering a second degree.

Apart from that, any advice on potential next steps and how to move forward would really help solidifying my plan for the future.

I'm currently working at small startup, so I have no issues with money, and can afford to spend some time for self education.

The dilemma is, do I grind leet-like problems, to try and get to good internship, or do I spend more time improving my basic skills and finding myself? I'm afraid, that I wouldn't be able to get a good internship, year after I finish my university. I know, that I can get a crappy one, I'm talking about ""good"" internships.",1620553346
n89znr,pimemento,How does ESOPs work?,"I have recently joined a startup (< 20 employees) as an engineer in Berlin, Germany with 3 years of experience in the specific area the company works on (ML/ fintech).

Because of this, I can only find the energy to do about 2-3 hours of programming a day.

I have BS in Chemical Engineering and been working as an engineer in oil and gas field for 4 years since graduating. I’ve realized that this field is very unstable since we have multiple layoffs in a couple years I’ve been there. Especially with Covid, things got worse. We had layoffs almost every week when it first started last year. Also there’s very little chance to move up. I’ve been working from home for almost a year now and really enjoy the flexibility and productivity it gives. I have to go back to the office in 2 weeks and will be sitting in a room with 4 other people. It’s so hard for me to just think about that...

I started looking into remote jobs available for engineers and 99% are software/ full stack dev jobs. I then started to look into it and saw some people successfully got full time job after learning coding and going through code camp. I just started a HTML and CSS course and feel excited about this path.

My question is do you think this is a right path? Do I need to go back to school and get a BS in Computer science since I really don’t want to. What is the best way/program to learn and  be ready for the job? How much time should I devote for this journey?

n7xedb,techindie,Need Career Guidance. Have 2 years of work Experience at a dead end job.,"Hello.

I know this probably gets asked a lot, but I need some advice on my career progression.

The thing is, I have been working as a database engineer for almost 2 years but most of the work is not very challenging. It is very repetitive and you don't require much cs knowledge to do it. As a result, I did not manage to gain any actual experience as I was doing the same thing day in and day out.

In these 2 years, for almost 1 year I was free. I did not had any work to do and no calls to attend. So i started doing leetcode. Its been around 5 months of leetcode now and I think Iam OK at it now.

 I know how to solve problems and I want to shift companies. The problem now is, I don't have any Skill or actual work experience to share with my future employer. All I know is how to leetcode and some basic select queries and creating stored procedures in database.

I have been applying to many companies in this pandemic but none have reached out to me. I think the culprit is my lack lustre resume as I have nothing to to showcase as my actual work.

Its just 2 years of bogus experience.

So what do I do? I can't apply for a Backend engineer role since I haven't worked on it. I can apply for database roles but i only know the basics. 

Shall i start leetcoding sql queries?


Is there any role where I can utilise my leetcode skills and basic db skills to get a good job? 

What should be my next step in order for me to get selected in any other company with a decent hike? 

Iam at my wits end.

**TLDR:**
 Worked for 2 years. Most of the time, was free. Hence no actual work experience. Did leetcode practise in free time. Now i dont get any interview calls because I couldn't showcase my work in my resume and I have basic skills only.

The research position is one that I started last year. It’s a big position that I’ve published a paper for at a well known laboratory. It’s the largest selling point in my resume as I’ve been at this position for a year now and its a full time 40 hr/week job. I want to continue in this same field after I graduate, but I want to do industry and not research. 

The internship is one that I just got at a startup company. It’s not well known but it’s a decent position that’s exactly on track with what I want to do after I graduate. It's a part time 15-20 hr/week job.

Which one goes on top on my resume? I’m working on both positions at the same time for this summer. The internship is more recent but the research work is more important. I'm anticipating that the internship is only for the summer, but the research is for the next year as well. 

The dates will look like this after summer is over:

n7vzc1,BrenoFaria,What is a good area to pursue to get a job as fast as possible?,"Hey! I'll elaborate here, if you don't wanna read, it's basically the title.

I'm 16, currently on my last year of high school (Brazil), and I'm moving to Canada next year. My high school will be over in December 2021, and hopefully my classes in Canada (University) will start in September 2022 (I can't go before because I couldn't afford so). So, I'll basically have almost a year ""free"", and wanted to do some course online or something that could get me a job in Canada (that would REALLY help me to afford my studies, since my family income is in reals, which isn't worth a lot).

n7v0if,devSlashBug,Need help in finding out the next steps of my career,"Hi all, I'm in really need for advice, so I hope it's OK to post this here.

I'm a back-end developer with 7 years in exp. I worked in several companies, mostly doing APIs and dealing with dbs. I have a bachelors in Software Engineering + business, so it's like a weird combination and it lacks some areas of a ""traditional"" CS degree. I have also experience with working with front-end, although my skills are not at the same level of back-end, but I can pretty much find my ways of doing stuff in Typescript/Angular. I also deal with ""Ops"" stuff, like CI builds, Docker/K8s/Helm, but again, not an expert. I can prepare images and all the like but I'm not a infrastructure/network/security expert.

Anyway I'm currently in a job which the tech stack is modern and it's the only reason why I wake up everyday and go to work. The team is awful. Management is awful. It's this culture of blaming when things go wrong, no support and I'd even go and say a bit of 'tech bros' culture. Another thing that is bothering me is I get these huge tasks, not even a high level specification, just a ""wish"" of what they want. I try to make meetings, to find out what is it that they want, most of the time the meeting gets hijacked by one of them (the tech bros) arguing about something that we'll not need in 10 years. Then  I have to work my ass off to do things, then when I present my ideas or what I came up with they say oh but that's not it, or let's change this.. so the task that should be 2 weeks becomes months, just bcs I have no way to know what they want. Make no mistake, I don't work 2 weeks without talking about it, I post on our chats, i create documentation, diagram. But nobody seem to care and they only care later on. Frustrates the hell out of me.

So this has been going for over 2 years now. Recently I decided to start looking around for jobs and I found out this one which looks very interesting but it's completely out of my comfort zone. The tech stack is different from the ones I work with, and not only that, it's a different domain, I'll be developing let's say tools for other devs.  I already had an interview with them and will be having a second one, so I guess they liked me. It was very technical, about the tech stack I work now, and there was some other general questions. I liked the interviewer, it was fair and felt more like a good conversation.

So, now I'm wondering what should I do. I'm kinda getting scared of jumping and then finding out it was too much to handle. I stalked some ppl there and they all seem super smart and working with like 3, 4 different languages, doing all sort of different things and I'm here like: Why they are even considering me? I only know 1 language ""well"" + front-end but not that deep.

I kinda understand that if they decide to offer me the job, it's because they believe in my skills and my past track tells that given challenges and new things I have always overcome them. I'm excited about it and I think it will be great for me as a professional to broaden my skills but the imposter in me is telling me that this is TO much and I'm panicking a bit :).

So I guess what I'm after with this post is: What you think about moving to a job where you don't have much exp with the tech stack? What things could I ask during the interview to assess if they are really aware of the fact that I lack knowledge and also if I will be given the time/support to ramp up and become a productive member of the team? I'm aware of my fears and the shitty imposter syndrome holding me, but I'm afraid of jumping in, then been given tasks where I have no idea what to do and then not get support, specially now with Covid and prob not meeting the team IRL for some months. In the other hand it's not like it's raining cool jobs, so I'm also worried of moving then being fired or not liking it, and have lost what I have today. I have my savings and would be ok without a job for months but I would prefer not to be in that situation.

n7ufp5,internally,Any other interns making more than their parents or come from a low income family and it feels extremely weird?,"It feels really weird to me. My dad is a security guard who works night shifts, morning shifts, noon shifts.. he is working whenever he's not sleeping it feels. I'm expecting an offer this Monday after getting an email entailing ""great news"" and a phone call from the company I interviewed with for two months, where I'll be making $28/hr for really cool tech stuff. My dad makes six dollars less than me with fifteen years of experience (we live in NYC so that is really not enough to live off alone haha). So I dunno man. T_T 

Granted, I worked extremely hard to make it to this position too. This will be my fourth technical internship on top of other extracurriculars and hardships I faced (my grandfather died from COVID. also, poor grades lol), so I'm very happy, but do feel a twinge of ""something.""

I think I just want to give back to my family honestly. They're not bad people (well, my mom treats my dad as a ranting bag thoe). Only thing is that my dad is extremely tired and overworked for what he's paid, and both my parents don't clean up after themselves. Security guard work isn't necessarily hard but during the pandemic, my dad would say things like, ""If we die, we die,"" which implies that he doesn't think much of his life. Not sure what to really think or if I can even help him change that.

Point is, coming from a low income family to having pretty decent wages is like, mind blowing. I have such a hard time spending money because I'm used to not having much haha.

n7tyks,SheldonPlankerton,Entry level jobs in NYC,"Hello,

Currently I’m still in high school, but in a couple of months I’ll be in college majoring in CS. I currently live in Georgia, and I’m going to a pretty average college in the Atlanta area.

My family is telling me to stay here after college, but I’d really like to move back up to the NYC area. I’m not looking to explicitly work in the city (although that would be nice), I’d at least like to live in the nyc metro area. I wanted to know what steps I should take now to better my chances of getting a job up there.

I feel like I’m sounding pretty vague, but is it possible that in 4 years there’ll still be entry jobs up there? From what I hear most people talk about there being less and less job opportunities up there than compared to atlanta or the west coast.

I honestly don’t care who I work for, as long as I make enough money to afford a living space, food, and having enough to put away in savings. I don’t expect to be making 100k right off the bat, but I don’t want to be making so little I can barely get by but I think that’s everyone’s way of thinking.

n7tcl4,howsitgoingfine,Big tech execs seem useless or at best inconsequential,"I have a question about executive roles in big tech companies.

As long as I have worked for them and followed them they always seem like they lack creative juices.

These execs are always in such a position of privilege and rarely do they ever seem to improve the products they govern. I'm not arguing that engineers would be better at coming up with product ideas and the general direction, but I do think that some people are naturally good at ideas and strategies.

Which is weird because these types of personalities are generally the engineers at a company. And the execs tend to be more like salesmen or managers grandfathered into their high status role.

Ideas people should be execs. Not managerial people. These are two very different types of people. One type is good at managing others, details, facts, schedules. The other is good at big picture, creative, potentially a bit disorganized, and abstract thinkers.

Yet every exec I talked to so far is just a glorified manager. And their ideas are (no offense) usually pretty bad. I've seen great products get shafted by terrible ideas piled on top of it by people who have no understanding of what a good idea or bad idea looks like. And you can see this in almost every big tech company.

Want a great example? Activision Blizzard. It's clear the higher ups are not interested in making good games or they don't understand game systems. They are so out of touch with the product that it just seems like the perfect example of this. It happens on a smaller scale at every tech company. And it makes me wonder why these people even need to exist. These execs remind me of DeeDee from Dexter's lab.

n7rnh1,mynameisanominus,Which jobs do you think I should go for? (Some experience),"Hi everyone,

Here is my current situation:  

* I work on a business intelligence team (title is business analyst) where I build solutions to minimize engineering overhead required for other business analysts to do their work. For example: Python wrappers around APIs/databases and machine learning tools.
* I am able to work in and understand a ""cloud environment"": K8s on AWS, Artifactory, Docker, Spark
* Good background in machine learning (math major, 2 medals in Kaggle competitions).
* I would say ""good"" understanding of computer science fundamentals: data structures & algorithms and using these correctly in Python.
* Some Java understanding (3 courses from college).

My goals are pretty basic and probably common:

* Land a job in Seattle.
* Work with many other engineers in order to build a strong professional network.
* Work as part of a larger system/software-base (basically have my work intertwined with other SD's work. Most of the stuff I build now is stand-alone).

So now I'm wondering what sort of positions I should be applying for. I think I would be a good fit as a SD on a ML-engineering team, but these positions are scarce and seem to want people with more experience. That said, I'm definitely not set on staying in data analytics -- I think it would be great to learn new technologies as I can see myself working on a research/start-up team in the future.
  
  
Anyways, what do you all think? What sort of positions should I be applying for? Can you recommend any services that will help me land a job?

n7r1wl,pjwoo3,MLE/NLP Engineer positions at big tech,"Hi,

I'm currently a rising senior majoring in CS at a top 10 university in the US. I'm debating between graduating just with bachelor's or pursuing a master's in NLP/Human Language Technology (would only take me extra two semesters). I'm **mainly interested in NLP, Text Mining and recommendation systems** (haven't taken speech processing yet). My school is huge (top 3-5) in the NLP realm, and this is important not because of the rankings but because of the support and opportunities I'll have access to during my masters. If I graduate just with a bachelor's, then I'm considering an SWE role at big techs. If I end up doing a master's, then an applied ML position (MLE, NLP engineer, etc) at big techs.

I have taken some courses related to NLP/DL; I enjoyed them, but at the moment I'm not sure if I liked it enough to do a master's in it and potentially commit my career path to it. Job prospects and competitiveness of getting such positions at big techs would factor a lot in my decision.

I'm wondering **how competitive** it is to get an MLE/NLP engineer positions at big tech firms like FAANg, Linkedin, etc. What would the **expectations/requirements** be for MLE/NLP positions (ML- and NLP-related knowledge, research/internship experience, personal projects, publication, Leetcode, etc)?

n7p8b5,Ok-Yoghurt-7195,Web Development vs Machine Learning Course in the summer,"A bit of background: First year CS undergrad studying in the U.S., and I have a SWE internship lined up for the summer at a startup.

Hi, so I was considering also doing a course in web development or machine learning on the side during my internship. I won't have time to do both, so I have to choose one. ML is something that I have wanted to get into for a while now since it really excites me. But I feel that getting a job related to web dev would be a lot easier and also higher-paying. For example, the work one would do at a big/moderate sized tech company in a SWE job would be related to web dev right? I feel that jobs in ML are harder to come by, and especially for the bigger names, you need a masters or phD to really work in ML.

&#x200B;

What do you guys think I should do? Would learning web development help me secure a better internship next summer? Or should I focus on ML (something I want to do more) and risk a not-so-great internship next summer.

n7p1vk,planetoftheinsects,"What are examples of domain knowledge in programming, and could you recommend books for it?","I see lot's of books about programming languages, data structures, algorithms, design patterns, programming principles etc., books that don't give me ideas as to what kind of problems I want to work on or learn about.

I understand most of the time programmers probably learn about specific domains on the job.

Am I right, that programming is probably hard enough on its own, so we would work with experts from other fields to solve problems?

But I think it must be valuable to be an expert in something other than programming.

I feel like I am able to communicate with the computer, but I have no idea what to talk about, apart from trivial stuff, stuff that has already been solved. It is pretty boring.

I am not sure what I am interested in either. I have vague ideas about what open source projects I like. For example, I think ""vim is cool"".

So what? Should I learn C, dig into the codebase, and try to contribute?

I mean, that would be a lot of work for me, which is fine, but at least I want to know what alternatives I have, because I am probably not that passionate about text editors after all.

I know it is often recommended to find a problem in life, and try to solve it. But I have looked, and didn't find any problems I would want to solve with programming, in fact, I want to depend on apps and smart devices as little as possible.

I believe most programs solve problems we don't have, until the media and marketing convinces us otherwise.

But I don't want to give up, since I like programming, and it still seems like a better career option for me than anything else.

n7mq9p,drawx_x,Failing to find work-life balance yet another time - what am I doing wrong?,"So I'm just at the start of my journey, a few years out of college, but I'm finding myself failing to find any resemblence of a work-life balance at yet another job. I've worked as a programmer thrice so far and every single time, I'm facing the same problem - I cannot wrap my head around how to structure my days to still have a life. I've tried going corporate, I've tried smaller companies but the overarching problem remains the same.

In order to get to office at 9AM-ish, I wake up around 7:40 as my commute takes up around 40 mins in the morning and anything in the realm of 40min-70min in the evening depending on the traffic and accidents on the way back. So after I get out at 5PM, I'm home around 6PM, eat dinner and start my life around 6:40PM or so. In order to be able to live the next day, I have to go to bed around midnight, having prepared myself and sandwiches for breakfast and for work beforehand. 

This realistically leaves me with 4 hours between 7PM and 11PM which does not sound _that terrible_ on paper but in reality, after work I'm so exhausted that these hours couldn't be further from any ""quality"" me-time. I feel like my brain is fried - both from having to _pretend_ to work for a large part of the past 8 hours (which I'm sure many people working corporate can relate to - though now working at a smaller company, I feel like the problem remains largely the same), and from the lack of fresh air and/or human interaction during that time (I'm an outgoing person and I crave human interactions but at my previous jobs, the interaction was literally three sentences exchanged at the watercooler a day; now at this new job, it's the same thing - the guys I'm seated with in the room literally don't say _a word_ apart from ""Hi"" and ""Bye"" the whole 8 hours - and believe me I've tried to have them talking but having felt like I was conducting an interview again and again, I just stopped pushing). Also, I'm so appalled by any digital media after sitting 8hrs in front of a screen that the things I would normally do to unwind (watch YouTube, watch a movie, play games) are completely off the table as my eyes are dead and I can't even focus on those things. I feel both physically and mentally done and it takes me a good two hours to be able to do any focused, quality activity for the remaining two. 

In my previous jobs, this escalated so much that I'd gained like 15kgs over my year of working there, neglected basically all my hobbies and hated every hour of my life both on the week days (because of having no quality time outside of work) and on the weekends (because I wanted to cram so many things that I wasn't able to do during the week over those 48hrs that I was constantly stressed and frustrated that I could not). I did learn some lessons from that job and applied them now (like preparing meals in advance, forcing myself to sleep right etc) but honestly, the effect of those seems pretty negligible in the big picture.

So now I feel like I'm starting to fall into the same cycle again and I don't want to allow it to spiral as much as the last time. How do people still have a life while working full time? Having hobbies, friends and relationships, running freaking marathons? I do have all those things but am never able to sustain them when working full time. Even now I can see that my running schedule starts to fall apart again, I'm playing instruments 1 day a week instead of the usual 6 and so on. Despite rigorously sleeping 7h+ nights now, still the thing I'd love to do the most is just go and have a nap (which I'm forcing myself not to as it disregulates night sleep afterwards when done that late in the day). Is it the nature of working in CS and if you're not temperamentally compatible with being silent and alone for 95% of the day then you're not going to fit in? What am I doing wrong?

In order to get to office at 9AM-ish, I wake up around 7:40 as my commute takes up around 40 mins in the morning and anything in the realm of 40min-70min in the evening depending on the traffic and accidents on the way back. So after I get out at 5PM, I'm home around 6PM, eat dinner and start my life around 6:40PM or so. In order to be able to live the next day, I have to go to bed around midnight, having prepared myself and sandwiches for breakfast and for work beforehand. 

This realistically leaves me with 4 hours between 7PM and 11PM which does not sound _that terrible_ on paper but in reality, after work I'm so exhausted that these hours couldn't be further from any ""quality"" me-time. I feel like my brain is fried - both from having to _pretend_ to work for a large part of the past 8 hours (which I'm sure many people working corporate can relate to - though now working at a smaller company, I feel like the problem remains largely the same), and from the lack of fresh air and/or human interaction during that time (I'm an outgoing person and I crave human interactions but at my previous jobs, the interaction was literally three sentences exchanged at the watercooler a day; now at this new job, it's the same thing - the guys I'm seated with in the room literally don't say _a word_ apart from ""Hi"" and ""Bye"" the whole 8 hours - and believe me I've tried to have them talking but having felt like I was conducting an interview again and again, I just stopped pushing). Also, I'm so appalled by any digital media after sitting 8hrs in front of a screen that the things I would normally do to unwind (watch YouTube, watch a movie, play games) are completely off the table as my eyes are dead and I can't even focus on those things. I feel both physically and mentally done and it takes me a good two hours to be able to do any focused, quality activity for the remaining two. 

In my previous jobs, this escalated so much that I'd gained like 15kgs over my year of working there, neglected basically all my hobbies and hated every hour of my life both on the week days (because of having no quality time outside of work) and on the weekends (because I wanted to cram so many things that I wasn't able to do during the week over those 48hrs that I was constantly stressed and frustrated that I could not). I did learn some lessons from that job and applied them now (like preparing meals in advance, forcing myself to sleep right etc) but honestly, the effect of those seems pretty negligible in the big picture.

So now I feel like I'm starting to fall into the same cycle again and I don't want to allow it to spiral as much as the last time. How do people still have a life while working full time? Having hobbies, friends and relationships, running freaking marathons? I do have all those things but am never able to sustain them when working full time. Even now I can see that my running schedule starts to fall apart again, I'm playing instruments 1 day a week instead of the usual 6 and so on. Despite rigorously sleeping 7h+ nights now, still the thing I'd love to do the most is just go and have a nap (which I'm forcing myself not to as it disregulates night sleep afterwards when done that late in the day). Is it the nature of working in CS and if you're not temperamentally compatible with being silent and alone for 95% of the day then you're not going to fit in? What am I doing wrong? Do you have any tips, personal accounts?",1620471126

I wonder if I can name myself as a full-stack though, I think I know parts of the full-stack knowledge but just not enough to be handling all of the things without my seniors.",1620447574
n7gkcs,LeManateeMan,Need Advice For My Significant Other Finding a Front-end Web Developer Job,"Hi everybody!

My 26yr old S.O has a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from a school in Thailand and she has been having great trouble finding a full-time job in the USA since she moved here to live with me (\~2 years ago). The best she could find was an unpaid internship as a web developer at a crypto startup, but she isn't happy with that job since it doesn't pay anything, so she currently works part time as a licensed massage therapist. I am also in fact a computer engineer, currently working as a video game programmer at a indie gaming company.

My S.O applies to about 10 jobs a week and has applied for over 300 places now, I think. She has gotten like 3 interviews in 2 years of searching. I have worked with her to revise her resume at least 4 times to no avail. She has setup accounts all over Monster, Indeed, Angelist, etc.

Possible reasons why she has trouble finding interviews

1. Resume is probably not written well.
2. Her college is unknown to pretty much everybody in the U.S.
3. She doesn't have any full time work experience in the U.S. as a programmer at a well known company.
4. She is here on a long-term green card (she sometimes puts this on her resume).
5. COVID impacting hiring.

Is there anything she can do to improve her odds of finding a full-time web development job in the U.S?

My only advice:

1. Get her resume professionally written.
2. Get a masters in computer science from a well known U.S. university.

I would love to hear experiences from other immigrants who might be in her shoes and if/how they have overcome it.

Thank you.",1620445597,t3_n7gkcs,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n7gkcs/need_advice_for_my_significant_other_finding_a/,12,11,1,1594764845,1954,0,0,LeManateeMan,"Hi everybody!

Company B is fully remote, pays well, and the product is pretty cool.

n7fdre,nicholasKOKO,Are my expectations as a future software engineer too much?,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently a first year college student attending a pretty good Jesuit University in the north east of the US and I'm majoring in Computer Science. I intend on doing an accelerated program where I get my bachelors degree in computer science and masters degree in software engineering within 5 years. My bachelors tuition is practically completely covered with a full tuition scholarship, I am a commuter so I do not pay room and board, and my masters will hopefully be covered with a graduate assistantship of some sort. Therefore, I will likely be debt free by the end of my education.

That puts me in a great position of not being in any debt out of college with a bachelors and masters, as I also have fully financed a car that will hopefully last me the next 8-10 years. Therefore, the next step would be to move out of my parents' home and find somewhere to live. For years, my dream has actually been to live ""up in the sky"" in a highrise in a beautiful city, and many of the top tech cities in the country are ludicrously expensive to the point that software engineers may not be able to afford to live in them. Something that has been heavily weighing on my mind is the fact that I ultimately hope to move to Miami, Florida, in a high-rise condo (not apartment) ranging from $2000-$3000 per month, but from my research, it appears as if Miami is not a big tech city and the engineers/developers do not get paid as much as engineers in, say, the west coast. I'm at a loss because living in the west coast in a highrise in a city is nearly double or triple the cost of doing the same on the east coast, but the salaries are much higher over there. I'm unsure if this dream is unrealistic in my 20's, but I want to do anything I can to set myself up to make it happen. I've lived in a crammed house my entire life, and the idea of living in a cozy condo with beautiful views is peaceful to me. Additionally, I am in a relatively long-term relationship, and my girlfriend is on-board with the plan and going to school for registered nursing, however I am unsure if it would be wise to finance the condo together rather than pay for it myself.

How to handle this ?","I'm a Senior Software Engineer (just got the promotion) at a startup (2 years 8 months exp). We're a development team (6 members and expanding now) in Asia working on a Swedish project. I joined the company on August last year.  
My salary was ok but I got an offer from another company and I let know my CEO. Then he offered me more (almost twice as which I was getting at the company) and promoted me to Senior. Even before that both CEO and Team-Lead have mentioned to me that I'm exceeding their expectations and they're very happy about my performance. But I thought it was just something to keep me happy and keep tied to the company without any pay raise. But apparently, it wasn't.  
After the promotion Team Lead contacted me and mentioned that I'm performing well and I can be his right-hand man hereafter and said that he'll assign some advanced stuff to me which he was working on but now he doesn't have much time to work on since the team is expanding. I was surprised since there's already another Senior (at least 2 years more exp than me) who has joined the company way before I joined. But anyway I felt so good he choose me over other seniors.   
What worries me is the company is very flexible. We just have to complete 40 hours per week and for more hours we're getting OT.

n7e1ad,SquidwardTennispoles,Using a Military Deployment to Switch to CS from Physical Therapy?,"Hi all,

So I am in a strange situation. I got accepted to go to PT school about a month ago and was supposed to start in the fall of this year. However, my national guard unit got surprised with a deployment that's going to be from Oct 2021 to around September of 2022. This means I won't be able to start PT school until Jan of 2023.  I will be honest and say it does have me down in the dumps since I applied specifically after being told this deployment wouldn't happen but now it is. 

Now since I will be spending a year in Kuwait doing basically nothing (and will have internet access most likely) I have been looking at what I can do to not make that year a waste of time. Looking at CS vs PT I noticed how much more upward mobility and flexibility there is in the CS career field compared to PT. Also not to mention not having to go to PT school for 3 years which means no income at all and maybe some debt even with the military paying for schooling. 

I have always liked computers and have built many systems, but I have zero experience with code. If I applied myself over the course of a year would I be able to become proficient enough in the an area of CS to possibly switch career fields and work my way up from an entry level position in the future? If so what path should I take to go from learning to applying what I learned to looking for a job? And of course is it even a good idea to think about changing careers when I have an acceptance letter in hand to PT?
