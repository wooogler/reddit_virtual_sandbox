    "body":"I have the GI Bill but only about 20 or 24 months remaining. I stupidly failed a bunch of CC classes during COVID so college may not be my best option. I\u2019m not really in a hurry since I\u2019ll have a cost of living stipend so I don\u2019t really want a 3 month program but I\u2019d prefer to work sooner than 4 years from now. I don\u2019t do well in self-study without a solid foundation. Basing that off of how I learned musical instruments and human languages. Besides my awful CC experience, I\u2019ve always excelled academically and I have some experience with boot camp-type academic programs where I did very well. So I\u2019m looking for a program over the course of a year or two that, coupled with self-motivation, will help build a highly marketable skill set\/portfolio. I greatly prefer in-person to online, a program for absolute beginners who can barely do excel formulas, and to start ASAP. Located in Los Angeles. Thank you.",

    "title":"I\u2019m not sure if I should leave my full time job for a 6 month internship! I\u2019m getting super overwhelmed by this scenario \ud83d\ude2d",
    "body":"I currently work for a very large global company that offers good benefits and a 50k annual salary, but I just got offered an internship with the Disney College Program which lasts about 6 months. I graduated a year ago in May 2020 and getting to for a famous entertainment\/tech company seems like a dream come true. This internship pays me 1\/3rd less than what I\u2019m being paid right now. Here are some thoughts I had about this scenario: \n\nIf I leave my current company and go for Disney, I\u2019m going for something... \n\n1. I have a chance for something that seems like a lifetime! It\u2019s like you rather go for something and say you did it rather than regretting later that you should have done it \ud83d\ude2d \n2. My dream company is Disney \n3. It might open opportunities for me because I work for Disney at a certain period \n4. And I\u2019m looking for a job now anyway trying to get out of my current job! \n5. It\u2019s 6 months and the job isn\u2019t secure \n\nIf I decline the offer from Disney,\n\n1. I don\u2019t like my job that I\u2019m currently at and I\u2019ll keep thinking about declining that offer I had from my dream company that I had a chance to! \n2. I have a full time job now vs 6 months at Disney.\n3. My associates I work with now are amazing which I can make new friends at Disney so I\u2019m not too worried about that. \n4. The pay is way more here than in Disney \n5. Can work and still make money while looking for a new job rather than a deadline if I were at Disney \n\nI am so excited about this opportunity but the thought of leaving my current full time job for \u201cjust a 6 month internship\u201d, which makes me so overwhelmed! \n\nI started this job last December 2020, and my internship begins in August 2021! I had an internship with Disney back in August 2020 but it got canceled due to COVID - 19.  I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m risking for something that isn\u2019t secure when I have something already secured. And I know my parents wouldn\u2019t be too happy with that as well. I want to ask for time off but 6 months seems like a lot of time. \n\nI\u2019m 23 and I live with my parents. I\u2019m saving a lot of money now but my current job requires a lot of relocation in the future for higher positions. The situation at home is getting unbearable which is why I\u2019m always out all the time until I have to come home.\n\nSo it really feels like I\u2019d be wasting this opportunity if I I don\u2019t take it. And this internship is a big change for me where I feel like I can\u2019t say no. But I feel like if I leave my full time position for something that\u2019s temporary - I would feel very uptight about it. \n\nI\u2019m afraid I may be making a huge mistake for my future and feel so indecisive as to the pathway I should take. If someone has some good advice, I would love to hear it and would greatly appreciate your input!",

    "body":"I've nearly 3 years of experience. Previously, I was working on NLP API creation for certain use cases, for almost 2 years. Due to a bad manager and certain inflexibilities in the company culture and family situation, I switched jobs just at the beginning of covid pandemic. Opportunities were slim so I picked the first decent offer at a tech company (FAANG level). However, the role here was sde. There are a lot of operational activities and I feel that I don't spend enough time coding. There's a lot of stress due to production issues and the team is in a bad state due to extended attrition. And I'm tired and drained out and exhausted. And I'm not sure I want to continue working in this profile. I like my co-workers but the work culture requires regular extended hours and I am barely able to make out an hour of time to just do things that I want to do (such as workout or read). Not counting the time for necessary things like meals.\nWhat I would like to know is suggestions for alternate technical career choices where my experience so far would be useful. I know I'm asking for too much.\n\nKindly don't invalidate my feelings as I'm in a low place at the moment.",
