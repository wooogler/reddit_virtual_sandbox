38,n720b1,iamironman1995,Requesting time off for vacation,"Sorry for the long message but I need some advice on how to handle this. I‚Äôve been at my company for two years. I‚Äôve only ever taken long weekends off - mostly because COVID hit after being there for only a year.

I had plans for 2 trips in 2020. First one was a personal week long vacation at a resort in Asia and then I found out a close friend was getting married...in Europe. My boss OK‚Äôd this in 2019 - mostly because we didn‚Äôt have much going on. Which I was super grateful for!

Then COVID hit, everything was pushed out to the following year (2021). My friends wedding date was up in the air due to travel restrictions and the resort we booked cancelled our trip.

And now - places are opening up in the US and my company is super busy. We‚Äôre a very small manufacturing company and I do a lot here to keep things moving. We went from having no jobs going on for a few months to having numerous projects. My boss made a joke a couple months ago about how happy he was about the resort cancelling the trip and all I did was laugh because at the time no one knew where things would be. I didn‚Äôt say anything.

Just last week, my friend announced the wedding is officially back on for this fall. And even though my personal vacation is still cancelled due to the resort - my friends decided to choose a different location since were all vaccinated now. And I want to go...

We‚Äôre understaffed and since I‚Äôm doing multiple jobs, no one can really do my part. And no one at this company ever takes vacation time. 

My friends and family say it‚Äôs not my fault they can‚Äôt find 3 new hires to relieve the extra duties I‚Äôm doing and keep piling more work - just ask off.

I just want other peoples perspective",1620403555,t3_n720b1,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n720b1/requesting_time_off_for_vacation/,2,22,1,1570653184,0,1,iamironman1995
80,n6ok2g,Papayaaaa28,Should I quit my first engineering job?,"TLDR: first engineering job is toxic and I feel isolated and depressed. Got stuck doing shitty work and not learning. Working with senior dev who drives good engineers away and management has no intention to address it. Should I quit and focus on my mental health and interviewing? Or will that hurt my second job hunt a lot ü§î 

Hi all. I‚Äôve been in my first engineering job for about 10 months and I‚Äôve been seriously contemplating quitting for about a month. It started off as a good experience because I had a great senior engineer mentor on my team but once she left I realized that she shielded me from working with the senior developer who everyone dislikes. She left during a reorg where both my supportive manager and coworkers that I like got moved to a different team and I was left working with people who are all doing their own things. The senior developer is the only one I get to work with and his code is bad, the whole team depends on him, and I got stuck doing shit work for months (moving an app to production) so I basically just spend all day trying to get his code to run on my computer and he‚Äôs constantly changing it so I have to constantly meet with him. All of the code stuff I‚Äôm doing is shitty configuration stuff and it‚Äôs never ending. I‚Äôm not learning or building and everyday I have to say ‚Äústill working on the same thing‚Äù in scrum. The senior dev is not friendly, very condescending, mansplained the terminal to me, and basically just does what he wants since he‚Äôs been here forever. Adding on to all of that, I started my first job during the pandemic and throughout everything that‚Äôs been going on with BLM, Stop asian hate, etc. no one on my team talks about what‚Äôs going on. Add on to that that I‚Äôm the only woman of color on a team of 20 men and I‚Äôve started hating and resenting my job to the point where I have crying breakdowns everyday. I‚Äôve also expressed my frustrations to my manager months ago and asked to get put on a different project but nothing has happened. I hate the company culture and a bunch of people have left my team as well. I‚Äôve given up on pushing for change here and I‚Äôve started job hunting. I‚Äôm trying to hold out longer but part of me is wondering if I should just quit and focus on my mental health and interviewing. I have about 3-4 months of savings saved up as well. I‚Äôm mostly concerned about losing negotiating power or having to job hunt/explain my situation in interviews. I‚Äôm also concerned about not having my first job tenure be a whole year & the idea of potentially not finding a job for months. Any thoughts? I‚Äôm trying to hold out but my mental health is worse than it‚Äôs ever been. 

Advice would be much appreciated especially from people who have found a second eng job during Covid!",1620355700,t3_n6ok2g,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n6ok2g/should_i_quit_my_first_engineering_job/,309,66,1,1597886844,0,1,Papayaaaa28

138,n6ajk4,ThrowawaySEStudent,Feeling hopeless to find internship in 2021,"I was asked to post this in this subreddit. 

I'm a 21F Software Engineering  junior student in Lithuania.

Currently college requires an internship to graduate but I've been applying since February and still no luck.

I've been applying to unpaid internships so I could at least get experience and learn more but so far it's gets overfilled fast. I've been trying to get internship in sophomore year but during Covid a lot of companies canceled the internships so there wasn't any luck.

College wasn't exactly helpful because they had to deal with more than half students who didn't manage to find an internship. 

Managed to get accepted to the internship but the found out that it's isn't suitable for college requirements. 

I'm mostly good at Java and React Native. So there weren't a lot of positions suited for me.
I've been applying to internships that was available to me. I get passed at CV screening and even do good at the interviews but sometimes I get really anxious at technical questions that I almost forget everything only after the interview I realize  that I could have done so much better answering those questions since then I've been studying questions about algorithms more. 

I also get take home assigments but sometimes it's either clashes the college assignment deadline or I have to learn new language and framework to do the assigments. Once I have given assigment to the algorithm that didn't exist (at least when I tried to find mathematical formula of it in scholar.google.com). Other time I managed to complete the assigment and build a Springboot backend but the company replied that I didn't do the requirements that wasn't listed in their task. 

Perhaps I wasn't exactly dedicated to the programming as my peers were, since I was also busy with my second hobby? 

Previous semester I've had to take 7 classes (In Lithuania you can't select how many classes per semester you should take) so I didn't have time to built my portfolio though I have college assignments in github but I don't think that's enough. 

Currently I just feel hopelessness and tired. Though I will be applying to more companies before I would have to take an academic leave perhaps then I would have time to make portfolio.

So far I applied in LinkedIn, Glassdoor and other lithuanian websites that dedicated for internships. 

I would like to hear suggestions on where else I could apply to and what else I could work on.

I'd be happy to get an internship that will be accepted by college even the internship will be unpaid and have to learn new language.",1620316603,t3_n6ajk4,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n6ajk4/feeling_hopeless_to_find_internship_in_2021/,3,1,1,1620304402,0,1,ThrowawaySEStudent
149,n687d7,AmericanWonton,Is this what burnout feels like?,"Been feeling a little stressed lately, so I thought I'd ask this. Just a general disclaimer first, I'm not discouraging anyone from getting into this field. I'm a young sprout with small experience in this field just venting his frustrations, that's all.

I've been in an IT/Production Support role for two years. It's been a slog,(long hours, only made worse by the pandemic), coupled with repetitive work. I took night classes and courses to be able to land a job in what I THOUGHT I wanted to do, Software Development.  


Well now I left my old IT job and landed this Cloud Development job...and it's more of the same frustrations I had previously. Tight deadlines, long work hours, no one is invested in your career development, hours spent learning a company's business logic to apply numbers to...in other words, another grind. I LIKE working on my personal projects like web apps and games, but I go into work and that love just shuts off completely.   


IDK how I should be feeling about this; just wanted to see if anyone has felt anything similar, or if it got better? Maybe it's just the companies/positions I'm working in? Admittedly, Covid HAS made work culture worse in the companies I work for. I don't have a problem asking for help, but that gets difficult when everyone's busy and I don't have a human being to sit next to. Kind of wanted to hear anyone's thoughts, if it isn't a bother.

I'm juggling the thought of taking a lesser-paying, less stressful job elsewhere, then work on personal projects on my off time. At this point, money isn't an objective for me, sanity is. I just didn't know what kind of reputation it would leave if I just 'took off' from CS jobs for a while.",1620310402,t3_n687d7,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n687d7/is_this_what_burnout_feels_like/,40,428,23,1427205477,0,1,AmericanWonton

Opportunities were slim so I picked the first decent offer at a tech company (FAANG level). However, the role here was sde.

I like my co-workers but the work culture requires regular extended hours and I am barely able to make out an hour of time to just do things that I want to do (such as workout or read). Not counting the time for necessary things like meals.

163,n63oos,ChiknaMoulvi,Job Search Difficulties - 2020 Grad,"Hey guys,

I hope everyone is having a splendid day. I come to you all in need of some feedback and advice in regards to what you believe I may have been doing wrong in my job search process. I graduated last year in August, and have been looking for jobs since September.

Fortunately, I was able to secure a few interviews in which I felt that I did well as an Entry Level candidate however, after a few days of each of them, I would wake up to rejection emails suggesting that I did not have enough work experience or, an email directly from the interviewer suggesting that they found a candidate who had at least 1-2 years of experience more than me. 

I did two internships during the summer after my sophomore and junior year (2nd went on for 6 months until Covid hit and I got laid off - FML) however, they had a hiring freeze throughout 2020 and I received a rejection that went along the lines of the context I mentioned in the previous paragraph.

Throughout the past few months, I've just been depressed after receiving countless rejections, however, I did prepare myself for it, as the times are very difficult due to covid, but the impact of rejections was inevitable as it took a toll on my mental health. 

This past week, I gathered myself and have been putting in the maximum effort towards job search in hopes of success. I have been working in a startup part-time to maintain my visa status as I am an international student which I feel has provided me some valuable experience that I can now bring into my resume. 

Yesterday, I was considering exploring different paths/fields with my Computer Science knowledge and experience such as Salesforce Development and Data Analysis but I am a little misguided in regards to them and would appreciate any guidance that anyone may have.

I would also be grateful if you had any feedback or recommendations in regards to how I should up my game in job search and practicing interview questions on leetcode. I am a small Liberal Arts College grad who's looking for any sort of opportunity. Harsh feedback is welcome as well. Thank you for your time!

212,n5sbeo,imsoreallyscared,Likely to not graduate... job starts in June,"As an introduction, I'm a senior at a top 50 school double majoring cs + economics (biggest regret tbh). I was a junior last year doing well having had done 10+ APs for some credit, national merit finalist in hs etc so generally good student and was doing well but then covid struck and we all got kicked out of housing (avoiding personal info) I went without access to internet and was forced to move into an environment I avoided for years. I became incredibly depressed and basically couldn't be bothered to finish my classes even though I basically just had to open and take the final ( I was so miserable and shameful of myself I thought I deserved to fail even if I could pass). I failed 3 classes just from avoidance and got withdrawn from the university and on top of that I went through a breakup and that was the cherry on top.

I appealed late in the summer when I felt a bit better and I thought I couldn't tell anyone that that happened and they luckily let me back in. I miraculously went back and my financial aid was miraculously given back as well at the sympathy of a counselor. I started to feel better around the fall, and somehow luckily I got a job around December at a very reputable company for xx engineering with a great program. The thing is the mental health issues left me barely scraping by as I wasn't properly able to be productive and got basically all D's in all my classes which was fine for graduating I suppose, but I'm nearing the end of spring semester and the classes I have exams for I could cram and take, but my very very last cs class in circuitry was asynchronous and I basically didn't even look at it doing half the assignments, missed all quizzes and lab attendance grade, and the final is in a week. I'm confident in my ability to do well on the final tbh, but even then it looks like I won't be able to pass the class.

My job is set to start in mid June, and I don't think I'll ever be lucky enough to receive an offer as amazing as this job in the current job climate and in general. It's basically 100k salary w amazing benefits and opportunities at a top 50 company. I can't take this class in the summer as it's not offered either. I emailed the professor recently and he said he's a little sympathetic but unless I get a doctor's note for some assignments, he is being strict with all his deadlines and giving 0's a minute late grading policy. I really don't know what to do and I've heard of people taking jobs and not saying anything which tbh seems possible in this case, but I also am afraid of the risks of that backfiring and sorta disappointed having done the work for 2 majors and not getting a degree. I really haven't told anyone about this as my peers are so happy for me, but graduation is in a few weeks (luckily optional so I don't have to tell family) and it's eating at me inside. Only in the last few weeks I've started to get my shit together from the support of a few incredible supportive people to recover my other classes but this one class seems unsalvageable.

What should I even do? My friends family and relatives are all expecting me to graduate with this job. Should I just start the job and not look back? Or do I tell my company, lose the opportunity, and take another semester in the fall to graduate (if my university even lets me attend again after failing so many classes). It's so stupid that I did this to myself especially when looking back all I had to do was the bare minimum, but I also can't forget how debilitating the shame and depression that I went through lead me here. If I start my job too, I think I'm really confident that I will do really well.

286,n57on7,Dotaproffessional,Tentatively Offered a Job. Next Comes Vetting. Some questions,"Here's the short version of where I am in a hiring process. Skip to the tldr for the relevant question in bold:

Applied for a job I wasn't qualified for (by accident), surprisingly, they still wanted to interview me. 

I did well in the first interview, was asked to do a second one with the team I'd be working with. That also went well. 

Had a 15 minute zoom call with the hiring manager (from the first interview), he wants to hire me, but (as described above) I'm not qualified for the position I applied for, but he wants to hire me for a position that's being created currently (already submitted to hr, they're doing approval before its posted). Told me it SHOULD take 1-2 weeks, but knowing hr, make that a month. 

He told me I might consider doing a temp position in the mean time, but only if Hr could guarantee a smooth transition to the full time position. After about a week, hr could not give him the assurances he wanted, so he took the temp thing off the table and said we'd wait for the full time position.

Got an update friday, they're negotiating the salary with hr now. Got another update this morning: position passed the first step of the approval process, he expects the job to (hopefully) ""post"" this week. He'll then move my application to that newly created position where he'll then tell hr he wants to hire me for that position. 

**I then asked what step comes next. He said hr will do their vetting of me, then they'll formally extend me the offer. He said the vetting will be normal stuff like checking references and my education. I have the bachelor's degree in computer science that is required for this entry level position, but I'm worried about my gpa. While i didn't see anything about gpa requirements, my college gpa was pretty shit (under a 3.0) because I switched majors yata yata yata. I've heard from a friend who's a software engineer at an insurance company, that she's had people get hired by the hiring manager, and then upon hr reviewing their application, denied the hire because of their gpa. I don't know how typical that is though. Couple questions then. First, how common is it for people to check your gpa (rather than just verify that you do in fact possess the required degree). Of the 4-5 places i've gotten interviews with the last year (fuck covid man, so many places are in a hiring freeze, if not outright laying people off), only one has requested my transcripts. Obviously I didn't get that job. And my second question, how common is it for places to then reject you if your gpa isn't above a certain threshold? I mean its not like its beneath a 2.0 or anything. its just not above 3.0. If i were to just give them my gpa for the last 2.5 years (5 semester) when i formally switched majors to computer science, my gpa is a 3.06. I think that's a lot more relevant to my skills than to look at my long gpa history when I was in a completely unrelated major.**

don't sugar coat it for me. This is the first time since i graduated last may that a company was actually interested in hiring me. Its a large university hiring for biomedical research they do. I'd hate to finally have a tentative offer only to have hr give the thumbs down. If my hiring manager (whom i've built a rapport with) is emphatic enough, could he sway them?

314,n4y0bd,femSEGrad2021,New 2021 graduate looking for advice on my offers,"(Sorry I'm not super familiar with Reddit)

For some context on who I am, I'm going to graduate May 2021 and that is basically guaranteed at that point from a college in the Midwest. I didn't get an internship because of COVID. Moving onto the situation at hand, I'm having a bit of a hard time determining which option is better. For extra context, I would have to relocate for either of these jobs, and I am looking to relocate out of the midwest.

Right now, I have an offer from Cognizant, now I've looked through this reddit and heard a lot of mixed things about the company as a whole, but from what I'm able to see the offer looks good. Now then, this offer expires in a few days, so I would have to make the choice pretty fast.

The issue is I recently got in contact with someone at General Motors, who I have heard a lot less negative things about on this reddit. My interviews with them would start past the date of accepting the offer from Cognizant, and I'm not guaranteed to get a job with them after I go through these interviews. But again, I have heard less negative things about them compared to Cognizant.

Both of their start dates are in June, and are fairly close in what times they will reopen and I will have to relocate to where they want me to work at. I'm looking for any advice or opinions on either of these companies, or what I should do regarding if I take the offer I have now or try to go for the offer I could get from General Motors.",1620161735,t3_n4y0bd,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n4y0bd/new_2021_graduate_looking_for_advice_on_my_offers/,1,0,2,1620161183,0,1,femSEGrad2021
343,n4r9hi,cscarta2019,Salary Negotiation Update!,"Before covid (Summer 2019?) I had posted this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dflwh8/salary_negotiation_question/

So after I posted this I was pretty persistent about my promotion with my manager.  Because I was designing the system rewrite from the ground up, I believed I satisfied the SWE III requirements.

My manager didn't really agree, which was really disappointing, and he seemed to be ambivalent about the whole situation.  He didn't understand that my promotion had to be put in before a certain date and missed it.  This was January 2020.

At that point I escalated it two levels up and had a one on one with the manager of all software engineering for my company.  He was definitely more receptive but was also trying to make the point that I was ""silo'ed"" and needed to do more stuff to get my work noticed.

Coincidentally a month later we had a huge project come in with an incredibly aggressive timeline.  I was able to shift gears quickly and help complete the project, being a fundamental part of it.  This brought us up into March of 2020. 

Then COVID hit and I was told that I was SOL and come back in 3-6 months.  That sucked a lot especially since I had busted my ass for a huge company win.  I basically went on cruise control for the next several months, and kept inquiring about my promotion once the 3 month mark had passed.  I started looking for new employment during the summer, just passively and when I had time.  I had probably a dozen interviews over the past year to varying levels of success, some I got really close to closing.

My manager kept checking and the answer was always no.  As fall and winter rolled around I started nagging more about it.  It was pretty rough, on one end you have corporate saying ""there is no hiring freeze"" but then your manager saying ""all adjustments are on hold.""  

I had to sit through multiple town halls where they paraded marquees of all the people who did get promotions.  It felt like everyone was getting a promotion BUT ME.  At this point my manager had done a complete 180 and was pretty angry I had been neglected.  During my 2020 performance review I got the highest possible rating.

Despite all this, the corp still tried to say no to my promotion.  This brings us to March 2021.  Upon hearing their refusal again I got more aggressive with my job search.  There were some murmurings that my promotion was going through but it was still taking forever and I was given no ETA.

After taking a hackerrank from a company and probably getting what I would consider a C- to D+ on it (finished 4/5 of the problems, most without all test cases fulfilled) I was able to secure an offer of 85k.  I told my employer I was going to leave if they weren't able to get my promotion and more than the offer by Friday.

I was contacted the next day by the manager of software engineering and asked for my range, which I said was 90-100.  He offered me my promotion and 80 on the spot which I turned down, and was confused by.  Pretty much said give me 90-100 or I'm walking.

24 hours later I had secured the promotion to level 3 and a new salary of 90k a year.  It's amazing how fast these things can turn around when you threaten to walk.  I'm pretty happy now, and I didn't want to leave the company I work for because it has great perks and an awesome work life balance.

367,n4emv4,Bromoblue,Is anyone even hiring junior devs?,"Only a junior in my college so not having to apply for a job yet, but as I've been going around for several months applying for internships I've noticed a trend that almost no companies seem to have listings for junior devs. An overwhelming amount of listings are for senior positions. 

How in the hell are you supposed to get a junior developer job when it seems like 99% of companies only want someone with a minimum of 7 years of experince.

Or is the job market for junior devs just shit at the moment cause covid and the economy?",1620097722,t3_n4emv4,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n4emv4/is_anyone_even_hiring_junior_devs/,592,2065,93,1492779847,0,1,Bromoblue
370,n4e5z3,Nicholaslau95,I‚Äôm not sure if I should leave my full time job for a 6 month internship! I‚Äôm getting super overwhelmed by this scenario üò≠,"I currently work for a very large global company that offers good benefits and a 50k annual salary, but I just got offered an internship with the Disney College Program which lasts about 6 months. I graduated a year ago in May 2020 and getting to for a famous entertainment/tech company seems like a dream come true. This internship pays me 1/3rd less than what I‚Äôm being paid right now. Here are some thoughts I had about this scenario: 

If I leave my current company and go for Disney, I‚Äôm going for something... 

1. I have a chance for something that seems like a lifetime! It‚Äôs like you rather go for something and say you did it rather than regretting later that you should have done it üò≠ 
2. My dream company is Disney 
3. It might open opportunities for me because I work for Disney at a certain period 
4. And I‚Äôm looking for a job now anyway trying to get out of my current job! 
5. It‚Äôs 6 months and the job isn‚Äôt secure 

If I decline the offer from Disney,

1. I don‚Äôt like my job that I‚Äôm currently at and I‚Äôll keep thinking about declining that offer I had from my dream company that I had a chance to! 
2. I have a full time job now vs 6 months at Disney.
3. My associates I work with now are amazing which I can make new friends at Disney so I‚Äôm not too worried about that. 
4. The pay is way more here than in Disney 
5. Can work and still make money while looking for a new job rather than a deadline if I were at Disney 

I am so excited about this opportunity but the thought of leaving my current full time job for ‚Äújust a 6 month internship‚Äù, which makes me so overwhelmed! 

I started this job last December 2020, and my internship begins in August 2021! I had an internship with Disney back in August 2020 but it got canceled due to COVID - 19.  I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm risking for something that isn‚Äôt secure when I have something already secured. And I know my parents wouldn‚Äôt be too happy with that as well. I want to ask for time off but 6 months seems like a lot of time. 

I‚Äôm 23 and I live with my parents. I‚Äôm saving a lot of money now but my current job requires a lot of relocation in the future for higher positions. The situation at home is getting unbearable which is why I‚Äôm always out all the time until I have to come home.

So it really feels like I‚Äôd be wasting this opportunity if I I don‚Äôt take it. And this internship is a big change for me where I feel like I can‚Äôt say no. But I feel like if I leave my full time position for something that‚Äôs temporary - I would feel very uptight about it. 

I‚Äôm afraid I may be making a huge mistake for my future and feel so indecisive as to the pathway I should take. If someone has some good advice, I would love to hear it and would greatly appreciate your input!",1620096106,t3_n4e5z3,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n4e5z3/im_not_sure_if_i_should_leave_my_full_time_job/,218,0,1,1617586941,0,1,Nicholaslau95
392,n45m4c,tomathoe,Help me decide between two offers?,"Offer One: 

* 93k total comp 

* C#, angular, js, html, css.

* glassdoor reviews are trash. many talk about about the CEO being a douche, people randomly getting fired, unsafe covid practices, etc.

Offer Two:

* 100k total comp 

* java, springboot, jsp.

* glassdoor reviews are positive when it comes to the CEO and WLB. 

I am leaning towards offer #2 because the comp is higher and WLB seems better. However, I am nervous about taking offer #2 specifically because they use JSP. I'm not familiar with JSP but a quick google search tells me that it's outdated and bad. However, they also use spring which isn't outdated so maybe things will be fine? What do you guys think?",1620071681,t3_n45m4c,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n45m4c/help_me_decide_between_two_offers/,10405,4491,1,1450571643,0,1,tomathoe
456,n3lxcz,blinggo198,6 months into new job my employer is asking me to relocate. I can't bring myself to do it.,"I live on the West coast but after graduating into a COVID recession the only job I was able to secure was for a medium sized company based out in the midwest. When I was hired I was told I would eventually have to relocate. Originally I was okay with that, but over the past few months I've been having conversations with my coworkers and my boss, and long story short they've all make it pretty clear that  the company location is kind of a crappy place to live and they're worried I might not like it out there. I haven't heard a single good thing they've said about the location. Despite the fact that remote working for this company has been working really well, they're still insistent on having me relocate next month.

On top of that, my mom was recently diagnosed with some health issues and I'm can't get myself to move across the country and leave her without support for someplace I'm going to hate living in. My company wants me to relocate next month and I've been applying to other jobs but haven't had much luck yet. By this point I only have 4 months of experience. Would it be a really bad idea to quit this job without having something else lined up? Would it be better if I moved out there for a month just to show my employer I gave it a fair shot, and then quit?",1620009109,t3_n3lxcz,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n3lxcz/6_months_into_new_job_my_employer_is_asking_me_to/,7,3,7,1615591824,0,1,blinggo198
545,n2orm7,PM_ME_UR_LEGS_GAL,What do people at classical SDE roles do?,"I‚Äôve been working on an automated testing role for almost 2 years straight out of college at a fortune 100 company. I mainly work on junit for my testing. I don‚Äôt really enjoy my job but haven‚Äôt looked for other opportunities due to Covid crisis abs because my pay is pretty high. But now I think it‚Äôs very important for my career to move to a development role so as to not be pigeonholed as a QA guy(absolutely no offense to QA engineers). 

But the bummer is, I really don‚Äôt know what people with SDE titles do to even look for those kinds of jobs. I‚Äôve been working on my problem solving skills through leetcode and I‚Äôm confident that I can get the grasp of it because it‚Äôs mostly logical. But I have no idea what other skills I need to learn for development related questions or what kind of projects I should start working on. The product that I work on is a cloud application with microservices that uses java and follows CI/CD practices and I find its concept pretty interesting 

Can anyone please outline what kinds of stacks/frameworks classical SDEs at big companies use or work on so I can get familiar with them. Please excuse me if my post seems dumb. I‚Äôm really worried about my next step so I‚Äôd be extremely grateful if someone suggests me a direction.",1619895304,t3_n2orm7,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n2orm7/what_do_people_at_classical_sde_roles_do/,13,29,0,1550519186,0,1,PM_ME_UR_LEGS_GAL
