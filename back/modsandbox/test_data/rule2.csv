11,n782na,Wdr93,Platforms to apply to software engineering jobs for non Americans,"Hello

I’m a non American software engineer and want to get a job in the United States as an Embedded software engineer with 4 years experience.

What are the best platforms to use to maximize my chances and getting hired?

Is there any specific states or cities should I target more than others?

I’ve been using LinkedIn for some weeks but no positive replies until now. It may be related to the pandemic situation but still want to apply on other platforms.

Any help?",1620419147,t3_n782na,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n782na/platforms_to_apply_to_software_engineering_jobs/,2275,412,0,1533866005,0,1,Wdr93
12,n77uxg,Outragedfatty,Career change from sales into development?,"Hi all,

I'm a CS major that graduated college about 10 years ago, but since third semester been involved and in love with networking, working on it for the past 13 years between internships and full time jobs. About six years ago I was hired on a sales program for a fortune 100 company and have been here since.

Now, after the pandemic, I'm starting to get a little anxious about work (have taken a lot of time off in the past 2 months and am seriously considering a career change.

I wanted to get into a dev career path but I don't know how to go about it. My programming experience is what I needed to pass my college courses with good grades but have never messed with it ever since. I did my assignments on python, C/C++ or Java, depending on the professor requirements, but that's all.

I'm looking to study it again and actually get more knowledge and experience so I can get started in this career.

I'm 32 and make good money now so it's tough if I have to downgrade my career too much. I'm married and sole breadwinner due to our current visa situation.

As I have talked with a few friends from school and others, my current plan is:

-get some programming related certifications that will be relevant for my current job (I know they'll likely help very little on my new career but it's a start and will be backed by my management)
-learn python and go (python because it could be helpful on my current job and I heard go is the cloud language) 
-start contributing to open software to get ""real world"" developing experience

I'm curious to hear your thoughts, experiences, tips and whatever else that could help me (: if you have any idea of what kind of salaries I could expect in the NYC area that would be helpful as well!

25,n75y7k,Dry_Web_6008,"Started a new job after leaving an extremely toxic one, how do I let go of the bad vibes from before?","I worked at my last company for 5 years or so. It was one of those Kool-Aid drinking places where everyone is ""family"" and all that nonsense. During that time I had a bunch of managers, but my last one hated me from the get-go for some reason and my life a living hell. Right before the pandemic he called me all sorts of names, I went to his skip level, huge mess. I was ready to get out, and then the pandemic hit and suddenly jobs were hard to come by.

Then with the pandemic the company laid off 1/2 of their staff and it ruined what was left of the culture. Nobody trusted each other, everyone talked shit behind everyone's back, micromanagement, people constantly getting yelled at, coworkers that were friends turning on each other. It basically got to the point where I opened my laptop and wondered ""how am I going to get yelled at today?""

Long story short, I left that nightmare and started a new remote job. People from my old job are stalking my LinkedIn. I even had someone who still works there who I once considered a friend email me, tell me my boss talked shit on me for over 2 years in 1 on 1's (and still does), and that I was replaced by my boss's friend. I don't need old gossip in my life (and not sure what the point is to even rub my nose in this shit), so needless to say we don't speak anymore.

So long story short, after years of emotional abuse in the workplace I am having a bit of a hard time trusting my new coworkers. I keep waiting for my new boss to jump down my throat, or my coworkers to gossip about me, even though there's no inclination that either will happen. After years of passive aggressive code reviews, I'm trying not to project that tone on new people, but I can't help it. 

Other than good old therapy, do you have any work-place related tips on how to mentally ""start fresh"" with a new group of people?

38,n720b1,iamironman1995,Requesting time off for vacation,"Sorry for the long message but I need some advice on how to handle this. I’ve been at my company for two years. I’ve only ever taken long weekends off - mostly because COVID hit after being there for only a year.

I had plans for 2 trips in 2020. First one was a personal week long vacation at a resort in Asia and then I found out a close friend was getting married...in Europe. My boss OK’d this in 2019 - mostly because we didn’t have much going on. Which I was super grateful for!

Then COVID hit, everything was pushed out to the following year (2021). My friends wedding date was up in the air due to travel restrictions and the resort we booked cancelled our trip.

And now - places are opening up in the US and my company is super busy. We’re a very small manufacturing company and I do a lot here to keep things moving. We went from having no jobs going on for a few months to having numerous projects. My boss made a joke a couple months ago about how happy he was about the resort cancelling the trip and all I did was laugh because at the time no one knew where things would be. I didn’t say anything.

Just last week, my friend announced the wedding is officially back on for this fall. And even though my personal vacation is still cancelled due to the resort - my friends decided to choose a different location since were all vaccinated now. And I want to go...

We’re understaffed and since I’m doing multiple jobs, no one can really do my part. And no one at this company ever takes vacation time. 

My friends and family say it’s not my fault they can’t find 3 new hires to relieve the extra duties I’m doing and keep piling more work - just ask off.

Working with senior dev who drives good engineers away and management has no intention to address it. Should I quit and focus on my mental health and interviewing? Or will that hurt my second job hunt a lot 🤔 

Hi all. I’ve been in my first engineering job for about 10 months and I’ve been seriously contemplating quitting for about a month. It started off as a good experience because I had a great senior engineer mentor on my team but once she left I realized that she shielded me from working with the senior developer who everyone dislikes. She left during a reorg where both my supportive manager and coworkers that I like got moved to a different team and I was left working with people who are all doing their own things. The senior developer is the only one I get to work with and his code is bad, the whole team depends on him, and I got stuck doing shit work for months (moving an app to production) so I basically just spend all day trying to get his code to run on my computer and he’s constantly changing it so I have to constantly meet with him. All of the code stuff I’m doing is shitty configuration stuff and it’s never ending. I’m not learning or building and everyday I have to say “still working on the same thing” in scrum. The senior dev is not friendly, very condescending, mansplained the terminal to me, and basically just does what he wants since he’s been here forever. Adding on to all of that, I started my first job during the pandemic and throughout everything that’s been going on with BLM, Stop asian hate, etc. no one on my team talks about what’s going on. Add on to that that I’m the only woman of color on a team of 20 men and I’ve started hating and resenting my job to the point where I have crying breakdowns everyday. I’ve also expressed my frustrations to my manager months ago and asked to get put on a different project but nothing has happened. I hate the company culture and a bunch of people have left my team as well. I’ve given up on pushing for change here and I’ve started job hunting. I’m trying to hold out longer but part of me is wondering if I should just quit and focus on my mental health and interviewing. I have about 3-4 months of savings saved up as well. I’m mostly concerned about losing negotiating power or having to job hunt/explain my situation in interviews. I’m also concerned about not having my first job tenure be a whole year & the idea of potentially not finding a job for months. Any thoughts? I’m trying to hold out but my mental health is worse than it’s ever been.

I don't think I'll ever enjoy managing people just to manage, but I do enjoy being a team leader and staying technical. Over the past 2 years I've been shadowing local dentists (9 month gap during pandemic) and really enjoyed it. I'm thinking of using my savings to fund my way through dental school, as the older dentists I shadowed had extreme work life balance, high salary, and job stability. They all typical work 32 hours over 4 days, no call, rare emergency overtime, and seem to get more desirable with age.

The cs folks I work with over 40 tend to take 2 paths. The lucky successful ones (10% of people or less) get m7 mbas and move into the upper echelons, making great money with terrible hours. The remaining 90% of people on my path tend to settle into middle management, face lay offs, lack autonomy, face wage stagnation, and generally seem unhappy.

I applied to a competitive pre dental program with over 90% acceptance rate to dental schools but I'm getting cold feet as everyone I know is telling me it's not worth it (5 years long, 300k tuition plus lost wage). I'm also worried in the future dentistry will go cities l corporate and I'll be a slave to production.

97,n6lagt,cis-hetro_tyrant,Career hopping,"Hello Everyone!

Ok, I'll cut to the chase here, I'm a senior year fashion design student starting to get curious about software engineering. 

My primary reasons for career hopping, 

1. I like money.

2. Fashion isn't exciting and there's no room for meaningful innovation. Besides which consumers are simply not interested in fashion, like yeah sure everyone wants a Louis Vuitton or whatever but there's no value for craftsmanship or design, only 'hype'. The pandemic has forced the industry into an existential crisis and it seems like a sinking ship to me.

3. I want to be part of a meaningful community that doesn't have its head up it's a\*\*, tech/coding/UX/UI seems like a nice bunch of people... but I don't know that yet.

5. I don't want to live in NY/Cali.

I know people keep saying it's a trendy field and everyone is career-hopping into it but nonetheless, I have a few questions:


1. Is it worth it? Will it stay relevant? Is the money good? Is the work culture good (or at least not as toxic as fashion)?

2. Do I need another degree? I would rather not get another degree or Bootcamp. I'd rather be self-taught or a certificate. Is that a legitimate route to go or will I be wasting my time?

3. Are there any transferable skills between Fashion Design and software? I can make tech packs and spec sheets, 3D model a dress, draft patterns and textile prints, cut and sew a garment and photograph to sell.. but how do these skills transfer to something like software development? 

4. What does it take to get a well-paying job? The people I know in software keep boasting about 110k straight out of college, now that's rare obliviously, what kind of starting salary is reasonable and how does it scale with experience?",1620345072,t3_n6lagt,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n6lagt/career_hopping/,1188,880,0,1618523920,1,1,cis-hetro_tyrant

I’m not really in a hurry since I’ll have a cost of living stipend so I don’t really want a 3 month program but I’d prefer to work sooner than 4 years from now. I don’t do well in self-study without a solid foundation. Basing that off of how I learned musical instruments and human languages. Besides my awful CC experience, I’ve always excelled academically and I have some experience with boot camp-type academic programs where I did very well. So I’m looking for a program over the course of a year or two that, coupled with self-motivation, will help build a highly marketable skill set/portfolio.

118,n6efnz,Worldly_Pineapple_80,"Unknowingly took a job that will stagnate my skills, but it's low stress and the pay is amazing. Stick it out for a year?","Hey everyone. I'm a (formerly) lead developer based in the Rust Belt. Have about 12 years experience, skill wise I have had my hands all over the place. My last company went belly up due to the pandemic and earlier this year I started interviewing.

With remote jobs popping off, a whole new world was opened up for me with job opportunities. I got 5 offers since January. Some gave me close or near my low Rust Belt salary, or the benefits weren't great so I turned them down. Then I got an offer from a mid sized West Coast company (remote).

The job was for a mid level developer role and their salary was amazing for me, so I took it. But then I took the job and found out that the job itself is way beneath me skills wise.... and I haven't even wrote a single line of code in the 2 months I've been there. So here are my pros and cons:

Cons:

- Haven't wrote any code, worried I will stagnate skills wise over time.

- They mislead me, so not exactly hyped about that

- Company is going through a transitionary period, a good number of people have left and been backfilled

Pros:

- Pay is WAY more than I can get locally. For reference my friend works in my city as a senior dev and gets $40k less than I do for a tough dev job, while I tweak XML files and other easy stuff. Pay is also more than I got with other remote offers

- Great benefits (unlimited PTO with 20 days minimum encouraged, employee perks, don't have to commute)

- I like my coworkers and they like me

- Low stress. No micromanagement, no one cares what schedule you work, job is a breeze, no panic attacks come deadline time. And best of all, NO DAILY STANDUPS OR SCRUM SHIT!!!

So I am thinking about just sticking it out for a year. After all the mental stress put on by the pandemic, I feel like I could use a year to work a low stress job and remove myself from the rat race, at least for awhile. However, I am worried that I will stagnate and not interview well in a year. I have no problem getting offers now, and I figure that down the line I can work on my Github and stuff again and get back up to speed.

What do you think? Is it worth the risk this far into my career?",1620326736,t3_n6efnz,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n6efnz/unknowingly_took_a_job_that_will_stagnate_my/,84,44,59,1613154863,0,1,Worldly_Pineapple_80

I'm a 21F Software Engineering  junior student in Lithuania.

Currently college requires an internship to graduate but I've been applying since February and still no luck.

I've been applying to unpaid internships so I could at least get experience and learn more but so far it's gets overfilled fast. I've been trying to get internship in sophomore year but during Covid a lot of companies canceled the internships so there wasn't any luck.

College wasn't exactly helpful because they had to deal with more than half students who didn't manage to find an internship. 

Managed to get accepted to the internship but the found out that it's isn't suitable for college requirements. 

I'm mostly good at Java and React Native. So there weren't a lot of positions suited for me.
I've been applying to internships that was available to me. I get passed at CV screening and even do good at the interviews but sometimes I get really anxious at technical questions that I almost forget everything only after the interview I realize  that I could have done so much better answering those questions since then I've been studying questions about algorithms more. 

I also get take home assigments but sometimes it's either clashes the college assignment deadline or I have to learn new language and framework to do the assigments. Once I have given assigment to the algorithm that didn't exist (at least when I tried to find mathematical formula of it in scholar.google.com). Other time I managed to complete the assigment and build a Springboot backend but the company replied that I didn't do the requirements that wasn't listed in their task. 

Perhaps I wasn't exactly dedicated to the programming as my peers were, since I was also busy with my second hobby? 

Previous semester I've had to take 7 classes (In Lithuania you can't select how many classes per semester you should take) so I didn't have time to built my portfolio though I have college assignments in github but I don't think that's enough. 

Currently I just feel hopelessness and tired. Though I will be applying to more companies before I would have to take an academic leave perhaps then I would have time to make portfolio.

So far I applied in LinkedIn, Glassdoor and other lithuanian websites that dedicated for internships. 

I would like to hear suggestions on where else I could apply to and what else I could work on.

I'd be happy to get an internship that will be accepted by college even the internship will be unpaid and have to learn new language.",1620316603,t3_n6ajk4,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n6ajk4/feeling_hopeless_to_find_internship_in_2021/,3,1,1,1620304402,0,1,ThrowawaySEStudent

Well now I left my old IT job and landed this Cloud Development job...and it's more of the same frustrations I had previously. Tight deadlines, long work hours, no one is invested in your career development, hours spent learning a company's business logic to apply numbers to...in other words, another grind.

I hope everyone is having a splendid day. I come to you all in need of some feedback and advice in regards to what you believe I may have been doing wrong in my job search process. I graduated last year in August, and have been looking for jobs since September.

Fortunately, I was able to secure a few interviews in which I felt that I did well as an Entry Level candidate however, after a few days of each of them, I would wake up to rejection emails suggesting that I did not have enough work experience or, an email directly from the interviewer suggesting that they found a candidate who had at least 1-2 years of experience more than me. 

I did two internships during the summer after my sophomore and junior year (2nd went on for 6 months until Covid hit and I got laid off - FML) however, they had a hiring freeze throughout 2020 and I received a rejection that went along the lines of the context I mentioned in the previous paragraph.

Throughout the past few months, I've just been depressed after receiving countless rejections, however, I did prepare myself for it, as the times are very difficult due to covid, but the impact of rejections was inevitable as it took a toll on my mental health. 

This past week, I gathered myself and have been putting in the maximum effort towards job search in hopes of success. I have been working in a startup part-time to maintain my visa status as I am an international student which I feel has provided me some valuable experience that I can now bring into my resume. 

Yesterday, I was considering exploring different paths/fields with my Computer Science knowledge and experience such as Salesforce Development and Data Analysis but I am a little misguided in regards to them and would appreciate any guidance that anyone may have.

I would also be grateful if you had any feedback or recommendations in regards to how I should up my game in job search and practicing interview questions on leetcode. I am a small Liberal Arts College grad who's looking for any sort of opportunity. Harsh feedback is welcome as well. Thank you for your time!

It mentioned. “I found your details when looking for students who might be a good match for our Summer 2022 Software Engineering Internship!” (I had given my details earlier)

But, when I got the second email. I thought, I could do something about it, instead of letting it slide off. It mentioned, ““I sent you an email a few days ago and wanted to see if you were interested in Google's Software Engineering internship.”

I know I will very likely be rejected, but I want to atleast attempt my way to present myself for this internship opportunity. I don’t want to be turned down because of my grades, that would exacerbate my impostor syndrome. 

My GPA is around 2.3, but my interest in tech, is often much outside the classroom and grades. I would say I have a fair knowledge about tech, from the YouTube videos I watch. I know it is unlikely but should I contact the representative and talk or not do and skip it. Emailing the representative would help me better represent myself then my terrible GPA and transcript. I had re-done couple of classes, because I have failed them. And the pandemic put a major hit to my GPA. I want to capitalize on the very slim chance of trying for an internship. I wouldn’t want my GPA to be the sole reason decision of my rejection

208,n5u10s,Dense_Grapefruit1459,Counter Offer Advice,"Hello,

First Reddit post in a long time!

Story time: I am an engineering student, I have an associates in manufacturing engineering. Currently going for my bachelors. I have been a machinist for 5 years, minus 6 months where I was a tooling engineer before being demoted due to the pandemic. Shortly after I followed a coworker to a different company as it was made clear that my engineering position was being eliminated even after business picked up.

I recently was reached out to by a friend who's small shop was looking for another manufacturing engineer. The place offered me the position with no raise (I am paid very well for a machinist, I produce excellent results), and the benefits are not as good seeing as it is a much smaller shop then the one I work at. However, the way I see it is that engineering experience will help my engineering career in the long run compared to more machining experience. (It's not really a field that can be peaked, but I feel like anything else I learn would only be useful if I stayed being a machinist).

So with that job offer in hand, I gave my notice at my current job. Immediately upon doing so I was told to talk to the plant manager and explain the situation. I did so, while explaining that the company had treated me excellently, and that I was not leaving due to an increase in pay but rather more suitable work experience.

I was made a counter offer which will be given to me in writing on monday that states something to the following effect: I will become an associate manufacturing engineer, the company will reimburse the next 2 years of my tuition and upon completion I will be promoted to manufacturing engineer. However the duties of associate manufacturing engineer will not start for a few months while they free someone up to operate my machines.

In the machining/manufacturing world, it's completely normal for things to take a bit because skilled labor is hard to come by (especially now, given the current job market). I also did not find any reason to doubt the legitimacy of his want for me to fill this position. There is a lifetime employee/engineer retiring in a year or 2, and the other engineers have purchased tooling that has made me want to bang my head into a wall, causing real issues in the shop. I was a tooling engineer at one point, so there have been times I have told them things weren't going to work before even producing parts. (so far, I've won that argument every time after they try it anyways.)

&#x200B;

So my question with that all out of the way is: should I consider the counter offer? I have always heard they are bad to accept. However I do enjoy my current company, I just want to start my engineering career and start to leave my machining one behind. If I were to accept the counter offer, what sorts of things should I look for in the written offer to be safe?",1620258267,t3_n5u10s,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n5u10s/counter_offer_advice/,1,0,2,1602359428,0,1,Dense_Grapefruit1459
212,n5sbeo,imsoreallyscared,Likely to not graduate... job starts in June,"As an introduction, I'm a senior at a top 50 school double majoring cs + economics (biggest regret tbh). I was a junior last year doing well having had done 10+ APs for some credit, national merit finalist in hs etc so generally good student and was doing well but then covid struck and we all got kicked out of housing (avoiding personal info) I went without access to internet and was forced to move into an environment I avoided for years. I became incredibly depressed and basically couldn't be bothered to finish my classes even though I basically just had to open and take the final ( I was so miserable and shameful of myself I thought I deserved to fail even if I could pass). I failed 3 classes just from avoidance and got withdrawn from the university and on top of that I went through a breakup and that was the cherry on top.

I appealed late in the summer when I felt a bit better and I thought I couldn't tell anyone that that happened and they luckily let me back in. I miraculously went back and my financial aid was miraculously given back as well at the sympathy of a counselor. I started to feel better around the fall, and somehow luckily I got a job around December at a very reputable company for xx engineering with a great program. The thing is the mental health issues left me barely scraping by as I wasn't properly able to be productive and got basically all D's in all my classes which was fine for graduating I suppose, but I'm nearing the end of spring semester and the classes I have exams for I could cram and take, but my very very last cs class in circuitry was asynchronous and I basically didn't even look at it doing half the assignments, missed all quizzes and lab attendance grade, and the final is in a week. I'm confident in my ability to do well on the final tbh, but even then it looks like I won't be able to pass the class.

My job is set to start in mid June, and I don't think I'll ever be lucky enough to receive an offer as amazing as this job in the current job climate and in general. It's basically 100k salary w amazing benefits and opportunities at a top 50 company. I can't take this class in the summer as it's not offered either. I emailed the professor recently and he said he's a little sympathetic but unless I get a doctor's note for some assignments, he is being strict with all his deadlines and giving 0's a minute late grading policy. I really don't know what to do and I've heard of people taking jobs and not saying anything which tbh seems possible in this case, but I also am afraid of the risks of that backfiring and sorta disappointed having done the work for 2 majors and not getting a degree. I really haven't told anyone about this as my peers are so happy for me, but graduation is in a few weeks (luckily optional so I don't have to tell family) and it's eating at me inside. Only in the last few weeks I've started to get my shit together from the support of a few incredible supportive people to recover my other classes but this one class seems unsalvageable.

What should I even do? My friends family and relatives are all expecting me to graduate with this job. Should I just start the job and not look back? Or do I tell my company, lose the opportunity, and take another semester in the fall to graduate (if my university even lets me attend again after failing so many classes). It's so stupid that I did this to myself especially when looking back all I had to do was the bare minimum, but I also can't forget how debilitating the shame and depression that I went through lead me here. If I start my job too, I think I'm really confident that I will do really well. I have no idea what to do I just need to hear opinions.",1620253380,t3_n5sbeo,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n5sbeo/likely_to_not_graduate_job_starts_in_june/,1,1,0,1620251733,0,1,imsoreallyscared

264,n5euj6,123111223,How do I handle the feeling that I'm not learning much at my current position?,"I work at a large firm, and the pay is decent, though about just over half of what my friends make. This is my first job, gonna complete an year next month, right out of university - I did my internship here too. I'm working in a split model, where I offer technical support, and handle tickets for the better part of three days, and then I develop tools to support this team in the remaining two. Most of my active development deals with AngularJS and Java 8/Spring.

I wasn't interested in the support part at all, but I decided to continue with the job because I was afraid of the job market during the pandemic. I have continued to dislike it, but I have learnt how to better manage my time due to it. I also decided to think of it as the ""[eating my own dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)"".

Lately, I've gotten extremely frustrated because of the kind of code I'm exposed to. This team completely makes internal products, so we have next to no ""good code"". I have worked with better code than this in my second year of university. It ranges from ridiculous architectural designs, to unit tests that are written purely for the sake of it (think mocks an input and verifies that the input is mocked), and just zero handling of technical debt whatsoever.

I have toyed with the idea of shifting to a different team that does work on consumer-facing products, considering I love the firm I'm at but that seems to be unlikely because our support team is currently in the middle of a resource crunch. What do I do now? Should I consider a new job? Has anyone else been in the same position here?

EDIT: I'm also helping out interns who joined us this year. A common thing I've heard from the seniors is that ""its fine if they can't code well, its the easiest part of the job"".

I know full stack web development using PHP, Node, JS, TS, React ecosystem. Recently I learned basics of Vue, Laravel and  .NET Core during lockdown.  I have developed few projects and a big project for my graduation all thorough self-study. 

I am also familiar with Java, Python, C#, Rust. I am able to pick any new tech, analyse it and start working with it faster. I feel I know nothing sometimes too 



Situation:

I will be graduating in this month. Currently I joined in a small start-up company in my city. Only 3 people including me work there. I don't have clear scope for the future of the company. My CTC is 2.9L INR but I highly doubt if I'd even receive full of it .

I don't know how to progress in my career. I have no friends or mentors in this field. I don't know how to get advice from seniors , so using this platform to help me out.

Work is remote now. As most people working  in startup know, I too have a high work load. I kinda dislike the work environment because I don't have much interactions with my colleagues.



Advice needed:


1. Should I continue this path or shall I switch early ? Since I believe in my skills, I can do freelance too. However, it's very competitive to break through.


2. What other companies shall I try with my skillset ?


3. Some general advice for freshers

286,n57on7,Dotaproffessional,Tentatively Offered a Job. Next Comes Vetting. Some questions,"Here's the short version of where I am in a hiring process. Skip to the tldr for the relevant question in bold:

Applied for a job I wasn't qualified for (by accident), surprisingly, they still wanted to interview me. 

I did well in the first interview, was asked to do a second one with the team I'd be working with. That also went well. 

Had a 15 minute zoom call with the hiring manager (from the first interview), he wants to hire me, but (as described above) I'm not qualified for the position I applied for, but he wants to hire me for a position that's being created currently (already submitted to hr, they're doing approval before its posted). Told me it SHOULD take 1-2 weeks, but knowing hr, make that a month. 

He told me I might consider doing a temp position in the mean time, but only if Hr could guarantee a smooth transition to the full time position. After about a week, hr could not give him the assurances he wanted, so he took the temp thing off the table and said we'd wait for the full time position.

Got an update friday, they're negotiating the salary with hr now. Got another update this morning: position passed the first step of the approval process, he expects the job to (hopefully) ""post"" this week. He'll then move my application to that newly created position where he'll then tell hr he wants to hire me for that position. 

**I then asked what step comes next. He said hr will do their vetting of me, then they'll formally extend me the offer. He said the vetting will be normal stuff like checking references and my education. I have the bachelor's degree in computer science that is required for this entry level position, but I'm worried about my gpa. While i didn't see anything about gpa requirements, my college gpa was pretty shit (under a 3.0) because I switched majors yata yata yata. I've heard from a friend who's a software engineer at an insurance company, that she's had people get hired by the hiring manager, and then upon hr reviewing their application, denied the hire because of their gpa. I don't know how typical that is though. Couple questions then. First, how common is it for people to check your gpa (rather than just verify that you do in fact possess the required degree). Of the 4-5 places i've gotten interviews with the last year (fuck covid man, so many places are in a hiring freeze, if not outright laying people off), only one has requested my transcripts. Obviously I didn't get that job. And my second question, how common is it for places to then reject you if your gpa isn't above a certain threshold? I mean its not like its beneath a 2.0 or anything. its just not above 3.0. If i were to just give them my gpa for the last 2.5 years (5 semester) when i formally switched majors to computer science, my gpa is a 3.06. I think that's a lot more relevant to my skills than to look at my long gpa history when I was in a completely unrelated major.**

don't sugar coat it for me. This is the first time since i graduated last may that a company was actually interested in hiring me. Its a large university hiring for biomedical research they do. I'd hate to finally have a tentative offer only to have hr give the thumbs down. If my hiring manager (whom i've built a rapport with) is emphatic enough, could he sway them?

314,n4y0bd,femSEGrad2021,New 2021 graduate looking for advice on my offers,"(Sorry I'm not super familiar with Reddit)

For some context on who I am, I'm going to graduate May 2021 and that is basically guaranteed at that point from a college in the Midwest. I didn't get an internship because of COVID. Moving onto the situation at hand, I'm having a bit of a hard time determining which option is better. For extra context, I would have to relocate for either of these jobs, and I am looking to relocate out of the midwest.

Right now, I have an offer from Cognizant, now I've looked through this reddit and heard a lot of mixed things about the company as a whole, but from what I'm able to see the offer looks good. Now then, this offer expires in a few days, so I would have to make the choice pretty fast.

The issue is I recently got in contact with someone at General Motors, who I have heard a lot less negative things about on this reddit. My interviews with them would start past the date of accepting the offer from Cognizant, and I'm not guaranteed to get a job with them after I go through these interviews. But again, I have heard less negative things about them compared to Cognizant.

Both of their start dates are in June, and are fairly close in what times they will reopen and I will have to relocate to where they want me to work at.

343,n4r9hi,cscarta2019,Salary Negotiation Update!,"Before covid (Summer 2019?) I had posted this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dflwh8/salary_negotiation_question/

So after I posted this I was pretty persistent about my promotion with my manager.  Because I was designing the system rewrite from the ground up, I believed I satisfied the SWE III requirements.

My manager didn't really agree, which was really disappointing, and he seemed to be ambivalent about the whole situation.  He didn't understand that my promotion had to be put in before a certain date and missed it.  This was January 2020.

At that point I escalated it two levels up and had a one on one with the manager of all software engineering for my company.  He was definitely more receptive but was also trying to make the point that I was ""silo'ed"" and needed to do more stuff to get my work noticed.

Coincidentally a month later we had a huge project come in with an incredibly aggressive timeline.  I was able to shift gears quickly and help complete the project, being a fundamental part of it.  This brought us up into March of 2020. 

Then COVID hit and I was told that I was SOL and come back in 3-6 months.  That sucked a lot especially since I had busted my ass for a huge company win.  I basically went on cruise control for the next several months, and kept inquiring about my promotion once the 3 month mark had passed.  I started looking for new employment during the summer, just passively and when I had time.  I had probably a dozen interviews over the past year to varying levels of success, some I got really close to closing.

My manager kept checking and the answer was always no.  As fall and winter rolled around I started nagging more about it.  It was pretty rough, on one end you have corporate saying ""there is no hiring freeze"" but then your manager saying ""all adjustments are on hold.""  

I had to sit through multiple town halls where they paraded marquees of all the people who did get promotions.  It felt like everyone was getting a promotion BUT ME.  At this point my manager had done a complete 180 and was pretty angry I had been neglected.  During my 2020 performance review I got the highest possible rating.

Despite all this, the corp still tried to say no to my promotion.  This brings us to March 2021.  Upon hearing their refusal again I got more aggressive with my job search.  There were some murmurings that my promotion was going through but it was still taking forever and I was given no ETA.

After taking a hackerrank from a company and probably getting what I would consider a C- to D+ on it (finished 4/5 of the problems, most without all test cases fulfilled) I was able to secure an offer of 85k.  I told my employer I was going to leave if they weren't able to get my promotion and more than the offer by Friday.

I was contacted the next day by the manager of software engineering and asked for my range, which I said was 90-100.  He offered me my promotion and 80 on the spot which I turned down, and was confused by.  Pretty much said give me 90-100 or I'm walking.

24 hours later I had secured the promotion to level 3 and a new salary of 90k a year.  It's amazing how fast these things can turn around when you threaten to walk.  I'm pretty happy now, and I didn't want to leave the company I work for because it has great perks and an awesome work life balance.

370,n4e5z3,Nicholaslau95,I’m not sure if I should leave my full time job for a 6 month internship! I’m getting super overwhelmed by this scenario 😭,"I currently work for a very large global company that offers good benefits and a 50k annual salary, but I just got offered an internship with the Disney College Program which lasts about 6 months. I graduated a year ago in May 2020 and getting to for a famous entertainment/tech company seems like a dream come true. This internship pays me 1/3rd less than what I’m being paid right now. Here are some thoughts I had about this scenario: 

If I leave my current company and go for Disney, I’m going for something... 

1. I have a chance for something that seems like a lifetime! It’s like you rather go for something and say you did it rather than regretting later that you should have done it 😭 
2. My dream company is Disney 
3. It might open opportunities for me because I work for Disney at a certain period 
4. And I’m looking for a job now anyway trying to get out of my current job! 
5. It’s 6 months and the job isn’t secure 

If I decline the offer from Disney,

1. I don’t like my job that I’m currently at and I’ll keep thinking about declining that offer I had from my dream company that I had a chance to! 
2. I have a full time job now vs 6 months at Disney.
3. My associates I work with now are amazing which I can make new friends at Disney so I’m not too worried about that. 
4. The pay is way more here than in Disney 
5. Can work and still make money while looking for a new job rather than a deadline if I were at Disney 

I am so excited about this opportunity but the thought of leaving my current full time job for “just a 6 month internship”, which makes me so overwhelmed! 

I started this job last December 2020, and my internship begins in August 2021! I had an internship with Disney back in August 2020 but it got canceled due to COVID - 19.  I’m afraid I’m risking for something that isn’t secure when I have something already secured. And I know my parents wouldn’t be too happy with that as well. I want to ask for time off but 6 months seems like a lot of time. 

I’m 23 and I live with my parents. I’m saving a lot of money now but my current job requires a lot of relocation in the future for higher positions. The situation at home is getting unbearable which is why I’m always out all the time until I have to come home.

So it really feels like I’d be wasting this opportunity if I I don’t take it. And this internship is a big change for me where I feel like I can’t say no. But I feel like if I leave my full time position for something that’s temporary - I would feel very uptight about it. 

I’m afraid I may be making a huge mistake for my future and feel so indecisive as to the pathway I should take.

I am leaning towards offer #2 because the comp is higher and WLB seems better. However, I am nervous about taking offer #2 specifically because they use JSP. I'm not familiar with JSP but a quick google search tells me that it's outdated and bad. However, they also use spring which isn't outdated so maybe things will be fine?

433,n3u029,Chizz89,Is it worth pursuing a CS degree at 26?,"Just a little background info. I’m 26 turning 27 this year. I first started at a university in 2012 but pretty much failed out because my priorities were terrible. Since then I’ve at 2 different banks. One as a teller and another in the call center and some landscaping work. I just want something more for myself and I don’t want my age to be a factor as to yeah I should have this and that figured out, etc. 

I started school at my local community college in the fall of 2019, I finished up my last 2 gen Ed’s, college algebra and csc 111. The following spring I took precalc 1 and csc 112 and ended up failing those classes because the pandemic started and zoom classes just wasn’t doing it for me (yes I know that’s a bad excuse and I should of passed). So fast forward to now, I will be taking precalc 1 & 2 this summer.

My goal is to take all the lower level CS classes at my community college and transfer them back to the university I first attended. At that point I will have to finish my upper level courses, electives and another math class (calc 2 I think it is).

At my community college, I have 7 classes left to take:
Computer science 2
Database management systems 
Data structures and algorithms 
Discrete mathematics 
Calc 1  
Precalc 1 & 2

All the classes above except precalc 1 & 2 are transferable to university.

Okay so I guess that’s a lot of background info...but my question is it worth going back to school at this age? I would like to be a software engineer. A lot of ppl have counted me out unfortunately. I want to prove them wrong as well as prove to myself I can do this. Also Idk if information science & technology could be an option as well because the CS math courses are kinda scary and I’m not a math wiz or anything. IS&T and CS at the university I plan to attend have the same lower level courses. 

Okay I’m done rambling. Thank you",1620042468,t3_n3u029,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n3u029/is_it_worth_pursuing_a_cs_degree_at_26/,174,2,274,1600129544,1,1,Chizz89
455,n3mnsq,Deep-Ad3797,What's the best pivot route for a Materials Engineer to Software Engineer?,"**TLDR:** I am a materials engineer who wants to switch to CS and picking web development route because it seems to be the most approachable but willing to hear out what others in the field think. I'm decent at leetcode and it kinda come to me easier because of my math background. But the caveat of this switch is maintaining a salary that helps out my fam for atleast now (willing to relocate anywhere I just help them financially). Wondering if it's doable and if so if you guys have advice.

**Long Form Explanation Below:**

1. I work at a semiconductor foundry as a materials engineer. I'm the guy trynna make sure the supply meets demand however, I want to switch over to CS because I don't like the location and I am decent at coding.
2. With my background I didn't know which direction to go through so I went on free code camp and just went the web dev route. Thought why not.
3. I want to leverage my previous technical experience so I was wondering if you all wanted to help me find my place in the Computer Science world. I already know python due to using for research before. However, the data science route seemed to be the most stringent on degrees and certifications. That's why I started to pick up web dev. Seemed the most fluid and I can knock out javascript and a couple projects by the end of the year.
4. My only caveat with not leverging my current resume is that I do have a salary requirement. I am right now helping my family out and paying for their bills along with mine for now since they got screwed by the pandemic. It won't be for long but I would need to maintain my salary of 89k atleast to do so. Is that doable if I switch? I can leetcode very very well. I am learning the whole algorithms and data structures aspect but, my math background kinda helps out a lot (I dual majored in math in college). This whole thing got brought up because my friend at Capital One landed about that much starting off in Texas. But I don't know if he was a fluke.

456,n3lxcz,blinggo198,6 months into new job my employer is asking me to relocate. I can't bring myself to do it.,"I live on the West coast but after graduating into a COVID recession the only job I was able to secure was for a medium sized company based out in the midwest. When I was hired I was told I would eventually have to relocate. Originally I was okay with that, but over the past few months I've been having conversations with my coworkers and my boss, and long story short they've all make it pretty clear that  the company location is kind of a crappy place to live and they're worried I might not like it out there. I haven't heard a single good thing they've said about the location. Despite the fact that remote working for this company has been working really well, they're still insistent on having me relocate next month.

On top of that, my mom was recently diagnosed with some health issues and I'm can't get myself to move across the country and leave her without support for someplace I'm going to hate living in. My company wants me to relocate next month and I've been applying to other jobs but haven't had much luck yet. By this point I only have 4 months of experience. Would it be a really bad idea to quit this job without having something else lined up? Would it be better if I moved out there for a month just to show my employer I gave it a fair shot, and then quit?",1620009109,t3_n3lxcz,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n3lxcz/6_months_into_new_job_my_employer_is_asking_me_to/,7,3,7,1615591824,0,1,blinggo198
484,n3c7oi,perceivedpleasure,Should I find a new job after my internship?,"I am a 24 year old software engineer intern for a small R&D company. Pay is what the average intern makes in 2020 ($25/hr), and I am part time. I like the job I guess, but I don't have any work experience in CS related fields besides this one, so what do I know about whether I really like it or not lol. I've been here for 2 months, by the end of month 3 I am apparently supposed to either get fired or be offered a full time position there (I am like 90% sure I'm getting a full time offering fwiw). No idea what the full time salary would be, but I imagine its probably around $36/hr? Just based off vague salary discussions with my friend who works there lol

I feel like I have so little experience, and so I feel a desire to reach out and just acquire as many work experiences as possible. To me, working somewhere new often seems like an important thing to do since I'm young and trying to dip my feet in the water you know? But my friend says its too soon and I should at least get a full year with this company, saying that it looks bad if I were to work somewhere for less than a year. However, don't internships carry the connotation of being a work thing that is understood to not have to be a year+ endeavour? So I was thinking maybe I could get away with only working there for 3-4 whatever months, and then snagging a new job that hopefully teaches new things and experiences I wouldn't normally learn from working at this specific company. I have to acknowledge though, I am so new to a lot of software engineering that if I worked at this company for a full year I know I would learn plenty of software development...

I made a bullet list of reasons I want to and don't want to leave. I was wondering if anyone here could graciously offer their advice/suggestion on what I should do? **Should I try to find a new job after working at an internship for 3-4 months, or stay with the company for a full time SW Eng. position because its too short of a time to dip out?**

Reasons I want to leave:
* I feel a strong urge to get many different work experiences while I'm young
* I want to work abroad badly. I'd stay with this job if they let me work remote 100% of the time temporarily, like for a 6 month span so that I could live abroad, but I highly doubt that they'd let me do that even if covid is still going on
* Not 100% sure, but I think I could find a job with better pay than this company without much difficulty. I just say that because I think its a small enough company and the nature of the company + my experiences so far makes it seem like the kind of company that compensates for paying employees less by giving them greater work freedom/control over their actual programming and promising better wlb.

Reasons I don't:
* This company has incredible wlb, definitely better than almost all other places
* I actually work with a long time college friend here who helped me get the job, I would definitely miss working with him but you know, if its better for my future career prospects I'm not gonna stay at one company forever just to work with a friend",1619979040,t3_n3c7oi,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n3c7oi/should_i_find_a_new_job_after_my_internship/,1065,493,1,1618768303,0,1,perceivedpleasure

I am Canadian and since the pandemic, I managed to secure another 2 jobs, 1 as a software developer and 1 as an UX designer. All in all, its been a blast , I've been working from home and currently hold 3 full time jobs (all however in financial sector).My question is, I am looking to shift to tech and I have no idea how I should write my resume or how to even say that I am working 3 full time jobs. A lot of my friends, have said that it is beneficial as it shows that I am a hard-worker, however I am concerned by the fact that my behavior is unusual and some perhaps some will view it as I am unmotivated and not loyal to the company.

545,n2orm7,PM_ME_UR_LEGS_GAL,What do people at classical SDE roles do?,"I’ve been working on an automated testing role for almost 2 years straight out of college at a fortune 100 company. I mainly work on junit for my testing. I don’t really enjoy my job but haven’t looked for other opportunities due to Covid crisis abs because my pay is pretty high. But now I think it’s very important for my career to move to a development role so as to not be pigeonholed as a QA guy(absolutely no offense to QA engineers). 

But the bummer is, I really don’t know what people with SDE titles do to even look for those kinds of jobs. I’ve been working on my problem solving skills through leetcode and I’m confident that I can get the grasp of it because it’s mostly logical. But I have no idea what other skills I need to learn for development related questions or what kind of projects I should start working on. The product that I work on is a cloud application with microservices that uses java and follows CI/CD practices and I find its concept pretty interesting 

Can anyone please outline what kinds of stacks/frameworks classical SDEs at big companies use or work on so I can get familiar with them. Please excuse me if my post seems dumb.
