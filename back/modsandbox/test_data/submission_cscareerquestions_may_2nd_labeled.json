I would always choose text chat to communicate with people. Over the phone call? Nope, text. Real life meeting? Thanks, I'm good with texting.\n\nAnd I was happy to work that way. My last job was 100% texts and I loved it. But then I quit. Decided to change my specialty (from web development to mobile development). Now it's been 2 years of learning and getting experience. I'm not in a hurry and I have a pretty stiff mindset of rather being found than looking for a job. I'm constantly getting approached by recruiters, but they're all the same -- ask me to schedule a call (no, thanks). I'm pretty sure that no one is going to offer me a job this way.\n\nWhat's your suggestion to this? Is it time for me to consider going freelance and never waste time with recruiters? I feel like it should be a very special kind of freelancing (no phone calls and real interactions). I think it's important to create some kind of an image or a brand with such a rules, so the clients wouldn't be bummed by this weirdness.","2":"Going through the interview process with a company and I\u2019m seeing that their Glassdoor is riddled with obvious fake positive reviews by current employees.

However I was told that they do encourage internal promotions, and it's possible for me to get a software engineering internship afterwards.

This job has more programming related tasks such as using SQL, HTML and XML (UI\/UX stuff). I could possibly negotiate some more programming responsibilities into the job as well. \n\nI'm fairly certain that the second job will look better on a resume in the fall because it has at least a little programming experience.\n\nwould you play it safe and take the second option to get a minor boost on your resume to maybe get a good internship next spring or summer, or risk it for the first option and potentially get a SWE internship, with an ultimate goal being to become a software engineer after university.","4":"I had been presented with a new role this week along with the requirements both I and the line manager agreed that I already fulfil that role.

What are the paths that you can take when you reach that point of your career?","10":"Long time lurker here\n\nMy dream company to work for is Jane Street Capital in the New York office. I'm intrigued by the fact that they primarily use OCaml for the sake of code clarity and from what I know the culture seems pretty good. I do also know, however, that it's notoriously hard to get into. I'd like to know if anyone has any insight on how to maximize chances of getting in like what to put on my resume, what things to study and practice before the interview, etc.\n\nA bit about me, I'm a math major with a CS minor with 3.7 GPA from an alright-to-decent school. My work experience consists of one data science internship where I didn't do much and I currently work at Amazon and approaching the 4 year mark so I want to switch to something else once I get all my stocks. I don't really have any side projects and wouldn't call myself a super good programmer, I am only particularly comfortable in Java and Python and don't know many software engineering tools other than tools internal to Amazon. To be honest I think I lucked out on my Amazon interview because my raw programming skill is kind of weak. However I am decently good at puzzles\/riddles and so I think I can understand complicated algorithms conceptually but I would need to practice a lot to be able to code them out. I never did competitive programming or anything like that but I did well in advanced algorithms courses which were based on pseudo code and proofs and diagrams. Also, as a math major, I found big O to be pretty easy compared to the kinds of math I did in my program. I don't think I would have any trouble analyzing the run time of programs and finding places where there could be optimizations.\n\nI'd be super interested in knowing what my chances of making it to the interview are and if anyone has any ideas for things I should practice or improve on to maximize my chance of getting in. I heard that Jane Street doesn't usually interview people who failed an interview with them before and so I'd like to get it right the first time. And while I went to a pretty good school I don't think it's a target school so that also hurts my chances, and I'm not sure what their GPA cutoff is or if there even is one. But I think my math background could be appealing to them. Any advice would be super appreciated, thanks!","11":"I ended up getting a B in the class for Intro. To Operating Systems. I understood most of the high level concepts but have forgotten or struggled to understand the finer details or the algorithms dealing with processes. I was able to complete the projects after reviewing and studying content again. Would it be worth retaking the class? My point is not to retake it for higher GPA but to hopefully understand the material better or in more depth. My concern is about how much of a mastery is expected for an entry level position or later on over time for OS concepts in a real world job. I am worried because operating systems is an important subject to get a job in the software development world from what I have heard. Should I put in the effort to do the class again to make sure I am ready for any problems that a real world job would utilize it?","12":"I'm in Toronto, Canada!\n\nBesides LinkedIn do you guys use a site to keep track on which big companies are hiring?\n\nFor example, blackberry posted their listing for  internships\n\n[https:\/\/bb.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com\/en-US\/Student\/job\/Ottawa-Ontario\/Software-Development-Student----Project-IVY---4-Month-Winter-Term\\_20210792](https:\/\/bb.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com\/en-US\/Student\/job\/Ottawa-Ontario\/Software-Development-Student----Project-IVY---4-Month-Winter-Term_20210792)\n\nBut it's not listed on Linkedin, 'm wondering if I'm missing other listings from big companies","13":"I'm in computer engineering and right now my GPA is just under a 2.9.

I've been considering a switch to tech and am working through CS50 and then want to move onto other certifications for Linux, Networking, Systems Admin, etc. Almost every entry-level job that I'm finding is negotiable on degree and certificates, but usually requires at least 1-2 years of experience in IT settings. I know that for many jobs you can find overlaps between experience and get interviewed and even hired without having direct experience. I'm wondering if this is true for IT\/CS? I saw this job posted with the state and I'm wondering if any of my experience can be applied. Is saying that I'm working through CS50 enough? What kind of non-IT\/CS experience can qualify for the information security field? I feel like a lot of my current experience as a labor market analyst can meet similarities with the other duties, but I don't have direct experience in an IT setting. I've tried writing scripts to make my tasks more efficient in the little time that I have and started learning Linux last year before the pandemic started. I would like to at least try to apply but asking if you have that experience is an initial qualifier\/disqualifier. I feel like I'm trapped because of how little I can devote to my certificates\/training around this full-time job and it is DRAINING me after 3 years. I'm trying to stay in some level of public sector work so that makes my options more limited.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, this is the job posting:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDESCRIPTION OF JOB:\n\nAs our Cyber Security Administrator you will take on a new environments, tools, or networks and address how to operationalize new and existing security policies, ensure new environments are compliant, you will automate scanning and logging in, and design how activities with be implemented.

However, this might not be the correct path for me, since I don't have the passion for research and academic pursuit that my peers have. Therefore, dropping out and getting a CS (or Finance) job has become a serious consideration for me.\n\nI'm currently finishing up my 2nd year, so ideally I would apply for jobs and dropout before the end of my 3rd year, since I don't want to dropout without an offer already. What do you all think my prospects are? ***I'm specially worried*** that companies won't want me because they might think: \"this person has no perseverance since they committed to a PhD but ended up dropping it\" or \"this person is too dumb for us since they couldn't even exit their PhD program with a Masters\". Is there a standard way of saying you're planning to dropout (in your resum\u00e9 or during interviews) without sounding like a quitter?\n\nIf you are wondering, here is a bit more about my background. I did by undergrad in pure math at a top school in the US and went straight to my current PhD program after that. ***I have no internships*** or previous experience (in CS or finance) except for a quantitative trading internship this summer at a top firm. My coding is decent (Python and C++, I can do LeetCode or CodeForces problems) but I don't have any projects to prove it. Should I focus on doing some coding projects and posting them on my website, to prove that I have the basic hands-on skills required?\n\nThank you very much for your help!","17":"I was hired as a new grad, \"Software Engineer I\" this past August. I was offered 60k (plus yearly profit share bonus that tends to be 20-30% of salary) in a Medium CoL area.  Because the pandemic was still pretty fresh at the time and jobs were scarce, I didn't negotiate my offer at all and took the 60k. At the yearly review in January I was given a \"prorated\" raise to 62k since I was only 4 months into the job.\n\nI absolutely love this job, but I do regret not negotiating my starting salary. It feels like I've lost out on a lot of compensation. Typical pay for entry level devs in my area 70k, and while this company gives out hefty bonuses that make my pay come close to average, those bonuses are highly variable and certainly not guaranteed, especially as the company grows.\n\nI'm coming up on 1 year of experience now and I'd like to ask for a raise. I would love 70k but I don't know if that's too much to expect, especially as Software Engineer I. And I have no idea when I could be promoted to Software Engineer II or what pay increase that would entail?\n\nIs 60k->70k after one year outlandish?

I've had a difficult time finding a the \"right fit\" and as far as I can tell it's everything to do with my level of experience and not as much my personality. My first job was a contract job that ended because the contract ended and they didn't renew due to the company having some internal issues. I ended up leaving my next job due to wanting to work in a different technology stack. The next place I worked put me in a position where they cut my pay massively hoping I would quit so they didn't have to pay me unemployment due to me underperforming in my position and I just got let go from my job yesterday where they claimed \"the company was going in a different direction\" and they wanted more senior level developers on the team. I assume that's true, but I still get the impression they thought I might have been underperforming based on other parts of that conversation. \n\nI'm job hunting now and am trying to figure out what I should be looking for in order to work at a place long term and grow as a developer in order to fill in any possibile gaps in knowledge I have so I can improve. I'm sticking to postings that specifically say entry level or junior to be on the safe side. I have a lot of experience mainly with web technologies like html\/css\/JavaScript and PHP\/MySQL. I just spent the last year and 8 months using codeigniter at my last job and got really familiar with it, but it seems like a lot of companies are moving away from these types of frameworks and  stacks in favor of AWS services and js frameworks. I have some exposure to AWS (completed an associate solutions architect course, but haven't passed the exam yet) and have been learning Vue but don't have any production experience with it and a lot of companies are looking for 2+ years even in junior positions.

I love game dev and i hope to release my own game in the near future. I decided I could escape blue collar life by learning to code more professionally and I did. I got a job at a healthcare company writing SQL and SSRS reports. 3 years later I got promoted to a new position working with MS Dynamics. \n\nThe company and culture, while corporate and corny at times, is anything but toxic. I feel valued and rewarded for my hard work. Management is supportive and it\u2019s a very collaborative atmosphere. Office politics exist I\u2019m sure but I don\u2019t have to worry about them. PTO is generous and so is the pay. \n\nBut I just can\u2019t focus. I\u2019m just not interested in any of this shit. It was the same with both the SQL and dynamics positions, which as tools are both fine and kind of fun to work with, but in the context of healthcare and the corporate world I just really have trouble staying on top of all the meetings, different projects, terminology, processes, ect. I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed. I swear to god sometimes a meeting will just land on my calander with zero context and people will talk to me as if I\u2019m an expert in whatever it is they\u2019re talking about but I literally have no clue. Sometimes I ask for context beforehand and it\u2019s just more shit I don\u2019t understand. I feel like I\u2019m low IQ and just managed to charm my way into this job.\n\nI have no idea what the hell is going on most of the time and I just kind of stumble my way through everything until it\u2019s \u201cdone\u201d and either deployed or forgotten about for 3 months until it randomly comes up again. I the meantime 6 other things will be piled onto my plate. Sometimes I finish shit without understanding what I did or what it\u2019s for.\n\nMy honest feelings are that I don\u2019t give a shit about my job. I just want to develop my games but I\u2019m not naive, I know putting it all on the line in the hopes my little indie game will take off is a dumb move... I just can\u2019t stand the office life.

In my prior experience, I've always received a scheduling email within the day.  Is a delay normal, or should I email a followup?","35":"I've been working in one of big companies developing custom OS for several years. My activities included developing userspace services, custom libc and some S\/W parts of the proprietary kernel. This was a job I really liked; the only reason I left it was a lack of understanding how tech processes should work. For several years, me and many my colleagues tried to change the situation, with little to no success; when most of talented colleagues left, I felt that the project stagnates, and also took an uneasy decision to leave.\n\nAnyway, even after some months passed, I feel that I really miss what I did there. I really liked the job, only political questions or absurd management made it less attractive. I would really like to find some project which is concentrated around the stuff I used to do. I'm particularly interested in concepts like capabilities, TCB, object-oriented; OSes and frameworks which attract me most include Fuchsia, Capsicum, Windows (not API-wise, though) and similar. I mostly dealt with C over these years; my C++ skills are rusty. Anyway, language is not a problem, I can learn new languages as well; I simply prefer C.\n\nAn ideal project would be:\n\n* An operating system which is aware of Orange Book and TCB, and tries to follow these principles to at least some extent.\n* Mostly userspace activities, like libc development, implementing miscellaneous services, perhaps even RPC to some degree.\n* It'd be perfect if I could operate on kernel\/userspace boundaries, e.g. implementing new system calls or other kernel<=>userspace interfaces.\n* Preferably the significant part is written in C, which I know much better than anything else; other languages are not a problem, the C is simply the favorite one.\n* The project has some space for an architect.\n* The job is remote.\n\nOf course, I realize that it's rather difficult to meet all these criteria; I mostly shown them for an illustration of what I like and prefer. I tried investigating many jobs available, but, given somewhat narrowed scope, it's difficult to find something. Most vacancies for C developer I checked deal with either firmware or hardware; whilst I'd really like to become proficient in these areas as well, I'd like to at least start with fields where I feel myself already proficient enough. That said, I'm OK to use languages other than C, and participate in projects which deal with other userspace parts; above is an ideal image of the world, I realize it's close to impossible to find something that specific.\n\nI'm struggling to find something which matches my interests, and would be glad for any tip. Finding a job which matches these criteria via search engines is difficult, if not impossible, but perhaps real people can give me an advice?\n\nUPD: I also should mention that quite a lot of my activities recently concerned taking architectural solutions, publishing designs on implementations and similar actions.","36":" \n\nI am a Jr. level developer and I have been applying to places like crazy the past month.

I've been taking all the SWE interviews I can get just for the practice and recently I've been offered a glorified Sales Engineer job. The comp is \\~120K + 15-20k bonuses. This is basically 50K more than I make now. The role doesn't sound very appealing, but from what I can gather they want someone to come to develop tools and scripts to automate their demo environment (so there would be some SWE). \n\nRegardless, I would still keep grinding LC if I took this job because I don't want to end up in the sales engineering world. **Will taking this job hurt my ability to pivot back to a pure SWE role?**  Would you give up insane WLB + vacation days for 50K for a temporary role as a sales engineer?\n\nRight now I'm still confused.

My manager and teammates are great and I get along very well with everyone. I use a modern, in-demand tech stack and am paid well above market rate. With that said, my time here has been extremely challenging. I work longs hours yet am doing much less coding than I anticipated. The breakdown is approximately:\n\n30% \u2014 Development. We do not have dedicated QA or ops teams, so a good portion of this time is spent either testing or handling build\/deployment issues.\n\n25% \u2014 Docs, investigations, proposals, etc. Every change at this company requires time-consuming processes and external approval.\n\n20% \u2014 On-call activities. We have frequent week-long stretches of 24 hour on-call where getting multiple pages per day is the norm. We are expected to work a backlog of on-call-related tasks when not actively working a page, so I do not touch code while on-call.\n\n15% \u2014 Monotonous, repetitive tasks. This includes enabling feature flags and manual testing for things that we cannot automate.\n\n10% \u2014 Meetings.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how normal this is for a junior, but I suspect it is not normal at all.\n\nI have discussed the issue with my manager multiple times. He pays lip service to correcting the imbalance but I feel that I am stuck in an endless cycle of activities that are not enriching my skill-set as a developer. I have some interesting projects lined up but they require many hours of investigation and proposals before I\u2019ll touch any code.\n\nMy biggest concern is that my experience looks good on paper but, in reality, is lacking. Future employers may expect more from me than I am capable of delivering, given my sub-par experience at my current job.\n\nI am not sure how long I will stay with this company; I am in my 30s and want something more laid back and without so much on-call. However, I worry about leaving my first job too soon and how this may be perceived by future employers.\n\nIs this what modern software development is like at big companies?

After sending out 40 something applications, taking 12 technical tests, and participating in 5 interviews for 5 different companies, I finally landed a frontend internship position with React.   \n\n\nInitially, I was so happy. Getting a paid position in my first year means a lot to me, as all my work seems to have paid off, but right now I'm dealing with a lot of anxiety. I don't know react. The interview from this company was mostly them asking about my hackathon projects and about box model and flex box stuff. Nothing that I consider part of a \"technical interview\". I feel like I don't deserve my place there, and as the date of the internship is approaching, me receiving my work laptop , I'm feeling more and more as an intruder. I knew the company beforehand, and their techstack and projects are so appealing to me, but I just can't help feeling like this.  \n\n\nHow can I make this feeling go away? Or, at the very least, how do I approach diminishing it?","59":"Examples:\n\nI think there's a 90% chance Java and its ecosystem (Kotlin, Scala, Maven, etc.) will still remain one of the best \"first language\" entry points for newcomers, and if you know Java you will not have trouble finding work - but it's more likely to be maintenance than greenfield kind of work.\n\nI think there's a 50% chance GCP outpaces Azure and takes 2nd place behind Amazon in market share sometime within this decade. \n\nI think there's a 10% chance COBOL gets a major resurgence   in popularity, as the current COBOL devs retire and the existing systems don't get migrated in time to avoid lack of personel with knowledge necessary to maintain them.","60":"I'm a CS major, but knowing React makes people immediately employable.

Also, on the internal hire portal there's some jobs with a level higher. \n\nIs it dickish of me to not want the job without the higher level?

I am curious to hear everyone's take on what is going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was working at a fairly large military contractor for last part of my schooling, and worked full time for a year (graduated in April). So started in Jan of last year and left in Feb. This job was great actually really enjoyed it, there was those days where I hated it but for the most part everyone was super collaborative, interesting work, modern stack, and not much to complain about. Then they started doing restructuring they ended up selling my team   to another company, got put on a new team, then that new team started getting dissolved, and I basically was unsure about my job and what was really going on. In addition to every thing that was going on after talking to other friends I realized I was getting pretty underpaid compared to market value for the area, I was getting paid 72k, and most places were 80-90.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now, I took a new job that is fully remote (it's local but they gave me the option to work remote), the job paying a lot better $110, which honestly probably is way to much, but hey they offered it.  However that is where this drama just barely starts. So this job has a TON of technical debt, more so then what they originally told me.  They have a backlog of almost a year plus worth of bugs, angular 8, and what not.  With this technical debt there are lot of bugs (I would say 70% of backlog items), many of which aren't even fixable with current stack, or super hard to trouble shoot.   \n\n\nAs we fix issues there is no current process to really test against production environment, and QA testers also are stuck with half testing it. So with that we fix things and it introduces other small things, or maybe it wasn't possibly fixed. Which is fine, but it is difficult cause all of these come back to look like its my fault.. Which our team is really small its me and one other guys (which doesn't do a ton). But lately I feel like everything has been a complete mess, and everyone is playing the blame game, and complaining stuff is not getting done fast enough. Which is the furthest from the truth. Which I think my manager would back me up, but I can tell hes starting to get frustrated with everything that is going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that I have started to document every single thing I'm working on, what I found, who I worked with, just if something was to hit the fan. But I  basically am worried that based off past stories I have heard one day I will just go in and they will let me go. (I guess they dont usually hire full time (as I am), looking at the company states 80% of work force is contracted employees) Which this was my worry all along because I know looking like a job hopper is not good. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are plenty of other stuff going on with the company, which honestly is just shady (they've been lying to 3rd parties, and I have to say stuff particular way or they get stuck paying more money). Just to list a few..  I'm worried if I'm let go it basically sets me up for a super bad looking resume and 100% a job hopper.... Feel like it's a touch situation to be in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAppreciate any insights\/experiences you may have had.","70":"Hi Redditors, I ran into the strangest situation this week and am looking for some thoughts and advice on what to do.\n\n**TL;DR:** As a contractor, I applied for an internal FTE position for the same role under my current manager that I was basically told I would for sure get. After my interviews and all positive feedback from them, recruiting won't move forward with my application. Could the recruiter have something against me or a vested interest to hire external candidates?\n\nDetails:\n\nI'm currently work as a contractor at a fairly large tech company via a consulting company. There's an opening for a full time position on my team for the same role that I'm working in now. (FYI, it's not SDE but similar.) I joined late last year and am doing well, so my manager (who's also the hiring manager for the position) recommended me to apply. Unfortunately, since it's a bigger company with a lot of rules, there's no simple conversion from contractor to FTE - I have to go through the full interview process. My manager basically told me this would just be a formality and my interviews would mostly be with people on our team whom I already work with.\n\nI finished all the interviews and got positive feedback during all of them. After a week, I asked my manager if there any updates and he said he hasn't heard from recruiting. So I reached out to recruiting asking when I can expect to hear and they said they're still debriefing other candidates and will get back to me when that's done.\n\nThe thing is, it's kind of strange but I was also asked to help out as interviewer for the same position that I am applying to since there are two FTE positions open for this role. Since I'm the only person doing this work right now on the team and whoever else we hire will be working closely with me, my manager wanted me to be an interviewer. So I interviewed a couple other candidates the same week I had my own interview. Recruiting held a debrief session with the interviewers - including me - and the candidates got the decisions within 3 days after their interviews. We didn't hire them. (Btw, I'm not involved as an interviewer anymore, because recruiting found out that I was a contractor and there is some rule that contractors can't be interviewers for FTE positions.)\n\nSo now it's been \\~2 weeks after my own interviews and I still haven't heard anything. I asked my manager about this again today. He said he's asked recruiting several times to move forward with setting up the debrief meeting for me, but that they \"seemed to be ignoring his requests.\" He told me that even though recruiting doesn't have a say in who gets hired, he is dependent on them to coordinate the process.\n\nI wonder why this recruiter assigned to me is refusing to move forward with my application? I haven't talked to them in person outside of a couple email exchanges, all very brief and polite from both sides. Even the initial \"recruiter screen\" and scheduling the interviews were done by other people. So I don't think they have anything against me personally, but perhaps they have a vested interest to hire the candidates that are sourced\/introduced by them? Has anyone heard of this happening?\n\nWhat should I do in this situation?? Can this recruiter actually block me from being hired? At this rate, they will continue delaying my application while they continue bringing in new candidates. And I'll be forced to extend my contract after it ends next month (and obviously, not guaranteed that I can continue extending in the future) and miss out on this FTE opening.","71":"Hello, I'm a junior dev at a start up company. I recently started questioning myself whether \"making things work first, then deal with issues later\" is a good mindset or not. From my little experience, I feel like my team tends to create things without deep analysis or designing\/architecting and without much consideration on what would potentially come up next. Just get things done first for customer, and deal with the rest later. For e.g. design a db in a way that it leverages the existing code as much as possible to get things done on time. Now a year later, it became a performance bottleneck, and the code is already coupled enough. It has grown a lot and become risky to make big changes. And fixing bugs\/issues from it is becoming really stressful for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where my question started. I wonder if this is the best way to deal with the things and if it's really true that we don't need to build \"future\" now. Can you guys share your experience?

The benefits are great but my salary just seems really low for the amount of work I put in and also for building a massive chunk of the front end of our project from the ground up. Anyways I wanted to know what others think and if I should either ask for a raise\/promotion or move on somewhere else after the 1 yoe mark. Let me know what you guys think and even better if you work or have worked in this area!","94":"Hi, I am just about to enter the summer vacation after my sophomore year of college and as you know, most people will be looking for software engineering internships next year.

I am in my mid 30s. A year or two ago I noticed whenever I am in a meeting and nobody asks me anything I just space out. I have no interest in what other people are doing and whether I could help them with advice.\n\nWhen lockdown started a year ago this just got worse. Instead of sitting in a room where the discussion is happening I can now just start browsing some crap out of the comfort of my room without anyone noticing, switching on only when someone calls my name. There were  few close calls when someone asked me for advice out of the blue and I'd bullshit my way out. Once I even confessed the meeting was taking too long and how I stopped listening ages ago.\n\nEven when I try to focus on what others are discussing I just drift away. \n\nAny ideas on how to handle this? Maybe someone went through something similar?\n\nThanks.","97":"Hey guys,\n\nI'm a CS student at my 3rd year, since I started I stopped having fun coding (used to do competitive programing).\nSo, what kind of remote job I could do now ?\n I want to do some work so I could finally tell if I'm in the right place. \n\nThanks for reading","98":"Pretty much the title.

So I'm a new grad who's been applying to places for a while and I've only started the interview process and haven't gotten an offer yet but I just wanted to ask you guys for your opinion. I guess I'll just list out the pros and cons and general thoughts. Also if it matters, I'm in Canada.\n\nSo on one hand, the pay is very very good, especially for a junior swe position without much experience. The only experience I have is doing a bit of freelancing stuff while I was in university. On the other hand, it's only an 8 month or so long position with the possibility of an extension afterwards. This is the main thing that's bothering me because I know that it's basically all about getting that first position and having like 2 years under your belt and it gets easier from there so I was hoping to land a good job for 2 years and try to get into some FAANG type company. With it being a government job, I've also heard it's kind of slow paced and boring but obviously there's various departments and the requirements were pretty new tech (which I've used and am comfortable with) so maybe that won't be the case. I'm also definitely a night owl and was hoping to join a tech company with flexible hours if possible but that's definitely the least of my worries.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty sure I should take the offer if given to me, but I would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThanks!","100":"I have this issue that was present before the pandemic but has gotten way worse since I started working from home.\n\nI only seem to be able to do deep work at night.

I\u2019ve attended meetings and chatted with coworkers, but that\u2019s it.\n\nThen, at night, I come alive. Suddenly the code flows through my fingertips like I\u2019m possessed. I don\u2019t know why the fuck this happens to me but it\u2019s terrible because I\u2019m spending WAY too much time at my computer. \n\nI exercise daily and get sleep, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s my issue.

I know there are posts about this but I seen many were about 3 years ago.. I'm currently working as a software developer and have been for 2 years.. However, I just don't find the joy in it anymore. I like coding but, I like coding things that I find are interesting..not what the business wants\/needs. I live here in FL and they are in desperate need for math\/CS teachers. Mainly math. I was thinking to start off as a math teacher and integrate some CS course work along the way. Maybe something for after school or something. I really love the idea that teachers get 2 months off and many days off. I can utilize those days to work on side projects or host CS lessons for free at our local library.. I know this is what I want but I think the biggest thing that makes me scared is the pay..But I can survive off of teachers pay..I just won't be able to order uber eats like I do now :p . Can anyone tell me about their similar experience or inputs on this? Thanks for your time!","107":"I've seen a lot of posts about the salary ceiling that exists in SWE and that it is very hard to progress past this ceiling into an upper-level management role. What dictates if someone is able to reach these managerial positions - is it pure development skill, soft skills, or a combination of both? Furthermore, for those who don't immediately move up past the positions at this ceiling, is it the case that you won't ever move up even in the future, or can you at any point in your career make that leap? \n\n  \nI know that many engineers are satisfied with staying at that ceiling position, and I totally understand that. For those who want to ultimately make a jump into a higher comp position, what is the typical route? Would it be to pursue an MBA \/ graduate degree, transition to a different company, or something else? \n\nI'm about to graduate from a top 10 school with a CS and EE degree and am debating between SWE\/PM\/Consulting. Obviously, money is not the only factor, but I would love to hear any insights into what the typical routes are once people reach a point of salary stagnation.","108":"I'm the lead engineer on a small team at a non-tech company (I refer to my work as \"enterprise software development\"). It's just me and a few juniors. My boss is an architect, kind of. I'll also add that I'm a decent developer, but by no means am I \"FAANG-worthy\".\n\nI've really enjoyed my job up until recently. I've had agency to implement things however I want, and I took that opportunity to make sure we were doing everything in a forward-thinking and well thought-out way, even if that meant taking a few hours\/days to try a few things out. By doing this, I learned a lot and even got to build some really neat solutions to problems we encountered while trying to build as smartly as possible.\n\nSome time ago, our CTO decided he wanted our company to be more tech-focused, and chose my boss's team to sort of spear-head this move. Since then, a lot of what we've been developing has been proofs of concept for different business-units, who are used to finding external vendors for technical needs. There was, understandably, considerable push-back to a lot of our work, because change isn't easy--it never is.\n\nThis sort of came to a head a few weeks ago when I was working on a 1-2 week PoC for some business unit (important information: we're a global company, so sometimes there's a language barrier when speaking with other business units). Throughout the development process I kept my boss informed. I told him what I understood the problem to be and how I planned to implement it. I then had him test it out and give me feedback so that I could make it really clean for the inevitable demo to the business unit who asked for it. He was on board... Until the day of the demo. We met (via zoom) to dry-run the demo and he told me, more or less, that in all of his conversations with the requesting business unit he'd never heard them complain about what my PoC aimed to solve, that he wasn't sure the product demo was going to go over well because of that. I was, I think understandably, upset. I asked him why he had approved of me working on this, why I hadn't gotten this feedback earlier, etc. and he just said \"I made a mistake\". Needless to say, the demo went poorly.\n\nThis is one instance, but we've been running into this similar issue (the poor demos, not the miscommunications) for a while and it's got me questioning my role at this company. Aside from this, I've been realizing lately that I have only been learning as much as I have because I chose to. There's not really anyone technical enough around me to give me feedback on my methods or talk through alternative options. Nobody would know if I built stuff in a shitty way, and that *feels* like a yellow, if not red, flag.\n\nThe relationship I have with my boss, which used to be very amicable and relatively close, has been strained by these turns of events, and the stress of work has started to bleed into my not-at-work life (I'm remote, so it's a figurative not-at-work).\n\nFinally, on Monday my boss told me I needed to let a few other folks (who I don't know and have never worked with) have access to our cloud-provider account (like, give them permission to create resources & all that). I asked him what sort of governance we were putting in place to make sure that nothing got out of hand, because it's my role to monitor our cloud-resources and when something's fishy, security comes after me, not him. He said, basically, that we can trust these folks, they're superior to me, etc. and that if security hassled me, I should just refer them to him instead. This feels messy and like it's just asking to be a pain in my neck long term.\n\nIs it time to start polishing my resume? Am I over-reacting? If I leave, it's just a bunch of juniors and an architect, and nobody really knows what we have other than myself (I keep our documentation available to everyone, but that doesn't mean they use it). The juniors would have no mentor and the architect hasn't written code in I don't know how long. I'm not, like, emotionally invested in the success of my employer, so leaving wouldn't really bother me, but I'm sort of at the point in my life where I'd like a \"career position\" so I wouldn't have to shop around for raises & whatnot every few years as is the norm in the tech world. Any advice is welcome.","109":"When I see an old co-worker, who is a developer or other CS related role, and their current job is a recruiting firm, what does that mean? Are they doing CS tasks for the firm, getting paid by the firm while they look for jobs, bounce around from temp job to temp job all facilitated by the firm, or none of the above?","110":"I know this question\/topic has been brought up multiple times on this sub, but I wanted to ask it again in the context of my personal experience. I'm currently going into my senior year at a top 10 university (top 10 overall, not necessarily for CS), and I'm studying CS and EE. After a few business\/consulting-focused internships, I'm looking to go into tech as I feel it would be a waste not to apply my technical background, and I really am interested in the industry. I have some solid programming skills and projects (mostly from CS classes I've taken), so I think I would fair well as a SWE if I work hard enough, but I don't ever see myself being the \"best\" SWE, or even among the top 5-10% of developers. Thus, I am already planning on going into SWE for a few years, then transitioning into something else, like PM. \n\nI also know that PM roles are extremely hard to come by, and the best time to snag one would be right after graduation. I think I would enjoy a PM role and my skill set is more aligned for PM, but I am concerned about getting into a leadership-type role in tech straight out of college. Again, I will have a CS degree from a great school and have some decent programming experience, but I'm certainly not the best programmer around or someone who codes for fun in their free time. Thus, it seems like I would be out of place starting off as a PM right away and being tasked with leading a team of engineers who are much more skilled than me. \n\nI feel like if I start out in SWE and gain some legitimate technical experience, then I would be a far more effective leader and PM, but on the flip side, getting a role in PM after working in SWE is harder than getting one right out of college. Am I misconstruing what a PM really does or overestimating the technical ability required? I've always felt that my leadership style is most effective when I am as knowledgeable about a task as the people I am working with, but perhaps that is not how I should be looking at PM roles. If anyone has any advice on the decision between going into PM right after college vs transitioning into it after a few years of development experience, I would love to hear your thoughts. It's all really just a big bag of imposter syndrome, but I wouldn't want to start out in a career that I'm not yet suited for.","111":"I just finished a three-week intro class with SheCodes. I am interested in learning more about coding, potentially with an eye toward a career change in the future.

As the title says, I will be starting my internship for a software engineering position this upcoming Monday but have recently developed a wandering left eye (strabismus) due to poor vision or partial vision in my left eye. I have a brain tumor which has caused me to have bad vision in both of my eyes for the past 4-5 years but my brain definitely has favored my right eye over my left eye. Whenever I focus on things my left eye drifts down. It only happens when I focus on things hard. If I am talking to someone or moving it isn\u2019t apparent and doesn\u2019t drift down. My question is should I tell my employer so they can accommodate for me(like bigger screen, use bigger font on programs, etc) when I start on Monday during orientation?

For a few months I bounced between doing resume stuffer projects and sending out applications.

This was really sub-optimal but at this point I was desperate and was willing to work anywhere as long as it was with a computer.

I started applying more on linked in near the end of the contract, and by some miracle an honest-to-goodness software role wanted an interview with me. The interview was almost devoid of technical questions, was obviously just a means for the contracting agency to steal someone's paycheck, and I was hired within 3 days.

Amid the covid crisis I had to settle for a virtual internship but it was just a professor from my school assigning a bunch of problems on LeetCode. How will I land a job if I don\u2019t have any professional experience? Has anyone been in this position? I\u2019ve been applying for the longest, I\u2019ve had interviews but they always seem to bring that up.","135":"Hey guys, I'm finding myself in a weird spot in my career, and struggling to figure out how to move forward.\n\nFor context, I graduated in 19, and I've been working at one company since graduating.\n\nI work for a consulting firm in the Midwest. I know it's not the most glamorous job, but the pay and benefits were competitive for the area and at the time location was really important to me.\n\nShortly after I started working, someone requested that I transfer into their department with the promises of being able to work on exciting technologies and expand my skill set, in addition to being 100% remote. This obviously appealed to me so I signed on.\n\nThe reality of it was that the team that was being put together failed to sign a single contract. So, I was assigned to a project in the meantime to ensure I was billing hours. That project was a small dumpster fire, and was entirely ETL and SQL work.\n\nAfter a few months it was obvious that the project was not advancing my career. I wasn't learning new languages, new skills, or improving the ones I already had. I was working with legacy \"code\", and the client was not interested in improvements or optimizations. They just wanted the product to work, and pay as little as possible to maintain it. There was no incentive for me to learn how to improve or optimize the work I was doing as a result, and I didn't have the budget to explore those things even if I wanted to. Something to consider is that because of the projects problems I got a ton of experience working directly with clients, managing and deciding on budgets, resolution times ,etc. I did a lot of the work of the PM in this role, as our PM took a backseat on a lot of this work. I consider this to be great experience, even though it was stressful at the time, but I'm not sure how to leverage it when searching for jobs.\n\nA few months ago, my boss left our department despite never fulfilling his promises on the kind of work I'd be a part of. I really feel like this has set me back in a huge way.\n\nRecently I was transferred away from that project onto another project that is entirely SQL work. This is despite the fact that I've been very vocal about my concerns as regarding my career development.\n\nI have a bachelor's in CS and an OCA certification for Java, but it's been nearly two years since I've written real code. What do I need to learn\/do to start putting myself in a position that I will be a competitive candidate for a role where I'll get to do what I actually want to do?\n\nMy interest right now is in full stack development, but I'm open to anything that really requires me to think and optimize and improve my work. Problem solving is what I love about this field, so if anyone has any other suggestions I'm all ears.\n\nI love working with backend languages like python, java, and C++, but recently I've been trying my hand at Javascript and found that to be pretty enjoyable too.\n\nI did create a small website using one of the main frameworks years ago, that had a front end\/back end that worked and was hosted by a hosting service, so I know I can do it. But it's been so long that I can't quite remember the steps I need to take \n\nI'm currently taking an online course on Javascript (udemy) to try to get a really deep understanding of the language before I try my hand at properly learning a framework. My HTML and CSS skills are terrible (right now, but I'm sure I can improve with some elbow grease).\n\nI am moving closer to a larger city (30 min drive) so hopefully my options for employers will greatly expand once I make the move.\n\nIf anyone has any advice at all, I'd love to hear it. For anyone who made it this far, thanks so so much for taking the time.\n\n\nTL:DR; How do I transition from a primarily SQL based role into literally anything else where I get to write real code.","136":"TL;DR: I've been transitioning to programming just from my own self-studying and guidance from my mentor, and I just wanted to get some feedback since I've been getting very antsy about securing a job. I have about 8 months of informal experience working with JavaScript\/React, although I've been doing an internship for a month so far at a brand new start-up working on the MVP for a React chat app. Can I get a full-time (ideally tech) job with this kind of background? Any tips on how I can make that happen? I do have a mechanical engineering degree and some years of experience there, but yeah trying to switch to coding, which so far I like a lot better.\n\nFull background:\n\nI started learning JavaScript basics at the beginning of 2020 to get ready for a coding boot camp, but then the whole pandemic thing happened and I felt less inclined to do the boot camp's remote program. Fortunately, I had a close friend who's a Software Engineer and also had prior experience teaching at a boot camp, and he offered to teach me personally as my mentor. He put together his own curriculum tailored for me based on what he thought would be most beneficial, starting with some cs fundamentals, then more web fundamentals, and then finally putting together an actual web application with React. I spent a lot of time building it under his guidance, really making sure to have a polished final product for my portfolio and resume (you can check it out here if you like: [https:\/\/www.rolemate.io](https:\/\/www.rolemate.io\/jobs))\n\nWith that experience, I was fortunately able to get a Software Engineering internship at a startup, where we're working on the very early stages of an app creating the MVP for a social app. It's been pretty good React experience as well as I've been working on new features with the guidance of the Senior Software Engineer.\n\nAnd of course, I've also been practicing with algorithms (my least favorite part) with an online course and just grinding away on different problems and mock interviews. This part is probably my weakest area and I'm still struggling to get solutions consistently.\n\nAnd that's pretty much where I'm at. I've been sending out a BUNCH of applications but haven't gotten a single response besides the internship. Is there any hope for me with my unconventional background?? I'd appreciate any feedback and insights!","137":"Recently I started a new job and quite frankly it's been a shit show. There are several reasons for this, but the most recent is that my company wants me to learn a language and framework I have never worked with before \"on my own time\".\n\nMy days now are filled with meetings and other busy work so I can't just throw on a udemy course because I have other things to fill up my work week. So the line that I have been given is that I will have to learn after work and on the weekends.\n\nI'm pushing back and saying no. I am not spending my personal time in already long weeks (45+ hours) to skill up for things that will primarily benefit my employer. Try telling people in other industries to use their nights and weekends for on the job training on top of the work week and they will tell you off.\n\nWhat would you do in this situation? I've worked at many other places and not one expected you to self train on nights and weekends.","138":"Hi all, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've always had an interest in programming but for whatever reason didn't go to school for it. I think when I was younger I just didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and it was hard to choose from all the options available to me. Also, I was terrible at school and ended up dropping out anyway. It's not that I'm dumb, I've just always found it hard to focus in school. I may have some undiagnosed ADHD and other illnesses that I'm going to therapy for now though. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently I work for a company as their sole Tech Support person. I'm feeling really burnt out lately and realized I don't want to do this for the rest of my life. I'm looking into either going back to school or attending a bootcamp. I'm not sure what to pick. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* If I went to a university I'd have to take out a loan (if even possible with my credit score). I'm planning on buying a house soon so that will probably drop my score even more. Not sure if that affects getting school loans at all. \n* I suck at math. Are there any CS degrees with less complex math or are they all kinda the same? I will 100% try to apply myself regardless but... yea. \n* What remote-learning schools do people recommend?\n* What bootcamps do people recommend\/have had success from? Did you have any prior education before the bootcamp?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that's pretty much it for my questions.

Would it be worthwhile relative to a 1 year bootcamp or just otherwise trying to be hired in with self-taught knowledge?","143":"This was pretty hard to admit to myself. I started working in this field around 5-6 years ago, and finished uni 2 years ago. Currently I'm working at one of the best companies in my city, meaning I get to work with the best people in this field. I'm pretty good at what I do, at least according to my performance reviews. From the outside, everything about my career seems perfect, I got promoted almost every year, and I get paid really well with stock options.\n\nHowever, lately I've been having my doubts. I don't really consider myself an extremely extrovert person, but whenever I don't meet someone for 24 hours my mood falls down significantly. I love talking to other people, getting to know other people, travelling, and in general I like to be on the move all the time. I just hate being in one place. Even when I was working in an office I used to go to different floors all the time with my laptop to work in different places. If I could I'd rather move to a different country every year.\n\nThe best time of my career was when travel was still allowed and I could travel to different cities within my company to help other teams there. There I could meet new people, talk with them to get to know what their problem was, go for drinks with them after work, and travel. I enjoyed this phase of my career the most!\n\nI'm still trying to figure out what I want from life, but I'm pretty sure if I keep doing what I'm doing I'll go crazy. Don't get me wrong, I love programming and there's a reason why I got into this field, but I can't sit in front of a computer for 8 hours a day without much social interaction. The best part of a day for me is when we have meetings, or when I get to pair-code with someone, or when we finally go for lunch where we talk with each other. As a sidenote, I also used to be a bartender during my high school years and I really liked the way there was always something to do, always some important issue to resolve, etc.\n\nTherefore, I guess my main question is, do you know of any role in this\/any other industry where my software engineering skills would be useful while I could also do what I love doing the most: talking to people, working on different projects, and travelling?","144":"Just got my masters\n\nHi all, \nI just got my masters this semester and i worked throughout the 2 years i went to school.

Usually SE2 are reserved for people who have about 3 years experience or if not then for people with their masters degree. \n\nSince i have my masters now and three years experience, is it worth asking my manager what other benefits i could get. Like i said i just got promoted to SE2 so i doubt theyll give me another promotion again.

I'm fine with not making as much money so long as I can comfortably live middle income lifestyle but much prefer if I can have time for myself. I just don't want to spend my life chasing after money like a slave and actually spend time with my family and pursuing my hobbies.\n\nHow difficult is it being a Software Engineer? How stressful is it? Do you wish to change your career? I hear many people who change their career away from software engineering to something else, why?\n\nPlease advise me.","161":"A bit of backstory. I'm 28 years old with an unrelated bachelor's degree. No prior CS experience, but I'm looking to make the switch to software engineering. I've been taking CE courses for a bit over a year now with the goal of getting a software engineering certification from the university I'm attending.\n\nEverything I've learned so far in the 3-4 classes I've taken has been restricted to a single coding language. I've chosen Python. I've come a long way and it's been a challenge getting as far as I have. I'm confident in my Python skills and know that I can program pretty much anything the language allows me to if I can do a bit of research. \n\nBut then I go to look for requirements for entry-level software engineers. And programming in a single language is 1\/10th of the requirements they're looking for. Most want you to be familiar with full-stack design. Comfortable in multiple languages. Familiar with both scripting and compiled languages. Proficient in databases. Networking. Familiar with a bunch of third-party tools that I've never heard of like WireShark or SoapUI.\n\nIt's so incredibly demotivating. It feels like I spent the last year and a half checking off ONE of TEN boxes that employers want in an entry-level employee. Is this normal? Should I be approaching it a different way? I'll be out of a job in January and was hoping to make the jump at that time. But it feels like I won't be ready for another ten years.","162":"Curious about how people respond to this situation. So in the past year or so I\u2019ve had some companies reached out to me again after ghosting me. Some I had phone interviews with. One company ghosted me after the on-site \ud83e\udd2e. I was kind of sick to their practices and just ignored them.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f don\u2019t wanna waste my time again \ud83d\ude0ewhat would you do?\ud83d\ude4f","163":"My company is offering a reimbursement for home office equipment and I\u2019m caught between two choices:\n1. Update an older 24\u201d monitor I\u2019m using in a dual setup to match the specs of the other (LED 1080p LG)\n2. Spend extra money out of pocket, and get an ultrawide monitor; ditching the dual monitor setup. - This will help me not only with cord management, but also the dual monitor setup is currently plugged into a docking station that is then plugged into my Mac. And the docking station needs power to operate, so my Mac is plugged in through all work hours which isn\u2019t super great for battery life in the long term)\n\nAnyone have any strong opinions either way? And if ultrawide, is it worth it to get one that\u2019s curved?\n\nTIA!","164":"I currently just finished my sophomore year at Texas A&M. I have a 3.685 gpa (planning to bring it up to 3.75 by time I graduate), and I am majoring in computer science. I don't have any research or past experience. I have a couple projects I have worked on, and I have had two past jobs unrelated to computer science. I have a couple clubs I am in (one social club, one sport club, and one academic club), but no leadership positions in any (would it even be worth it to put these clubs on my resume?). I basically don't have much to show other than my gpa, my couple of projects, and the fact I am in a compsci club. How hard will it be to get an internship? I am just now starting to apply so hopefully I can get one the summer after my junior year. Will one internship be enough to land a job?","165":"About 7 months ago I applied for a DevOps position at a company, got through all 5 rounds of interviews but in the end they decided on another candidate. Everything was positive but I specialize in software engineering and had little DevOps experience at the time so they decided I was a little too inexperienced.\n\nI've decided to apply at the same company this time as a software engineer, would there be any benefit to reaching out to the recruiter I went through last time (different recruiter this time) to see if I can skip some steps in the process\/etc? Probably not so much technical steps since it's a different role but maybe behavioral type stuff I was thinking?\n\nI've been told to do this before from another company but the fact that I'm applying for a different position - not sure if I should.\n\nAnyone done anything like this before or have suggestions? I'm leaning towards \"no harm in trying\".","166":"Hello, I come with an unusual question \/ scenario and was looking to get some advice or information from people who are in the field.\n\nI'm 23 and about to graduate with a CS degree and a 3.2 GPA from a decent university. I really like C# and .NET and have several webapps out there that I designed, built and deployed by myself(Including one that makes me a little $$!). I have a decent resume and would consider myself to be a proficient programmer who has enough full stack projects out there to let a potential employer know I'm a good candidate.\n\nI'll skip the pity stories because no one gives a shit, but I didn't have it easy growing up and often turned to trolling and being a piece of shit online for entertainment when I was a teen, it was the best form of attention I could get at the time. I used to bait people on reddit, twitter, and other social medias and say some dumbass shit, I loved the thrill of seeing just how many angry replies I could get and how angry people would get at me. This all took place when I was ages 15-18. \n\nI made the foolish mistake of trusting a good IRL friend of mine with this knowledge of my shit past and about 3 years ago we had a falling out and he doxxed me hard on social media. The logs and things that he posted weren't the most obscene things on this earth, but it did paint me as a very shitty, racist, ignorant person, even though I know for a fact that I never truly believed those things and was just memeing and trolling like an idiot.\n\nI could write for hours about all the things I lost because of it, but I don't want to bore everyone. I lost some old friends and my girlfriend had to disassociate herself with me for good, that one stung the most and still does to this moment.\n\nFast-forward to 3 years later, I've lost a lot of weight, been to therapy and can confidently say that I'm no longer that type of person at all, inside and out. I look back at those years with disgust. The original \"doxxing\" thread is now deleted. The comments on the thread are still there, and when you google my name, one of these comments comes up. It isn't a good look, but it's a lot better than before. I've tried many ways to see if the original doxx thread is archived anywhere but as far as I can tell it isn't (It definitely is somewhere out there, but it looks like it isn't traceable\/ easily found)\n\nSo, as I begin to look for a start to my career, I wonder if it's even worth it to press forward, knowing that inevitably someone from HR or a team member or recruiter is gonna google my name and see those two comments labeling me as a piece of shit, It's only a comment or two, so there is a ton of plausible deniability with there being no concrete logs linking to my name. I can't have any social media anymore, as it would most likely just get harassed and to be honest I have no desire to maintain a social media presence at all, is this going to be a problem for your average company? Should I just own up to everything if ever asked? \n\nI'm sorry for writing this cringe, pathetic thread, and I'm sure that many reading this will say that I don't deserve to have a career of any sorts, and I can understand your position if this is the case. This is something that has consumed my life for several years now and has drove me to the brink of suicide and back several times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks","167":"Situation: I've been applying to SDM roles at FAANG and other well known, west coast tech companies and basically none of them have decided to screen me. \n\nI have about 10 YOE in software development during which I have taken team lead roles where I have done both technical leadership and people manager tasks for several years (including recruiting, performance reviews, promoting subordinates and more). \n\nI believe the primary reason I am not getting interviews is because I specifically lack roles with the title of Manager despite highly relevant experience that fits the job description. (This was also confirmed by a Facebook recruiter who is trying to get me to interview for an IC role at the E5\/E6 level). \n\nI have been able to get Manager and Senior Manager level interviews at Fortune 100 'tech' companies on the east coast. \n\nQuestions:\n\nWould my chances of getting interviewed for a SDM role at a FAANG \/west coast tech company be better if I were to take an IC role at FAANG now vs a Management role at a Non FAANG company? \n\nI imagine the IC role would be the slower and more unclear route (would I have go from E5 to E6 to L1 at FB for example? I read somewhere that E5 to M0 is being phased out), whereas a couple years at a Senior Manager role may at least get me to interviews at various companies (hopefully including FAANG)\n\nAdditionally, would anyone be able to speak to whether it's easier to join FAANG by interviewing as an IC vs for a leadership role?","168":"What do you guys do after finishing on-site interview?\n\nDo you send the thank you email to recruiter or just leave it be and wait for them to get back to you.","169":"I\u2019ve been teaching myself programming for a couple years now and I have a couple projects on my portfolio.

CompSci during the beginning of the pandemic. I didn't have any work experience other than being a volunteer tutor at our school's compsci club and working part time at school as an IT assistant. Most of my projects are from classes that had a semester long deliverable and a senior year capstone project were we worked in a group with PMs and sponsors. The few personal projects that I have is a discord bot, a barebones path algorithm visualizer website, and a few web scraping applications for stocks and covid information. I didn't start applying to jobs till after I graduated (which is a mistake for sure) and I applied throughout the summer using LinkedIn and Indeed. Couple of friends gave me their referrals for companies in my area but never heard back from the company due to the lack of actual work experience, ie. internships\/co-ops. I got demotivated from the job hunt in september and was getting anxiety from not hearing back from companies and family members lecturing every other day about not finding oppurtunities. The pandemic also made me demotivated from starting new projects and doing leetcode problems without getting even a phone call from companies made me demoralized. I started only applying to jobs every now and then. Fast forward to now, in the past month I started some online courses on udemy, cs50 from harvard, and freecodecamp to learn more about web dev. Put the things I learned and started working on more personal projects, started applying to 10+ companies a day but still not hearing from anyone. I need advice on whether I should hit up a bootcamp and try to network there, in hopes of landing a job or keep doing what I am doing right now. Another option would be going back to school for my masters. My asian parents have been pushing me to work at a family member's restaurant out of state and saying I should make money instead of sitting at home on the computer. My family is a traditional Chinese family, my parents are first gen immigrants and I feel like I'm a failure and on top of the weekly talks about what I'm doing with my life, where I explain that I'm trying to learn more skills, do more projects to put on resume. My life has been getting pretty toxic and depressed and I don't know what path to take and wanted some opinion on what I should do since it feels like I'm stuck on island.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Graduated last year as a CompSci major, have no internships and co-op, started applying after graduation and throughout the summer, never heard back from any company.

Started applying 10+ applications a day this past month and picked up motivation to learn a new language in Javascript and did a few online classes and crash courses on web development. Getting pressure from parents to get a job (even though I am trying and applying every day) and feel so lost on what path I should take. Need some opinions on what I should do.","172":"How similar are IT to Computer Science?  I ask because after I completed the Google IT Support Certification last year, I was wrestling a lot with whether to actually transition out of librarianship into IT.  Eventually, I met with one of my pastors to get his advice, and he advised me that if I wanted to be a writer (still do), I should probably stay away from IT because the amount of work required to succeed on Help Desk while trying to advance beyond Help Desk would leave me too drained and burnt out to pursue writing (he said this based on people he knows in the IT field).  I recently stumbled across Free Code Camp and thinking about pursuing their training at least as a hobby, if not as a way to transition into a programming career.  My question: were I to pursue it as a way to transition into a programming career, would I find programming to be just as demanding as IT?

Only plus is the money. This is a lateral move. I have 15 years experience in the field and don\u2019t have a problem finding other jobs.

Will job postings that say \"full-time\" consider someone for a part-time position? It seems like I'm the only person wanting such an arrangement, and I'm sure from the employer's perspective they see a part-time software engineer as being less efficient for their business perhaps? I don't know - there have been studies that say people aren't even really productive for more than like 20-30 hours a week anyways.

Stay and take the lower position part time on 75k per year pro rata. That pay rate for the lower position is a good salary for the work. Convenient because I can go on mat leave again easy HOWEVER I don\u2019t want to go backwards in my career now \n\nIf I plan on going on leave again in a year, I feel I might as well take the money.

Long time lurker, first time poster.\n\nI wanted to ask you guys if it would be wise to include that I am attending college while trying to search for a $50k+ full-time web dev job. I feel like I would look too \"junior\", but then again, I am.\n\nA little background on me: I am 22 (started college at 18, left at 20, am now back at 22), currently attending university to obtain a bachelor's in IT, and finishing my second year at the moment. However, I need a full time job (don't we all).\n\nThe reason I am majoring in IT is because I am interested in that as well, I am CompTIA A+ and Network+ certified. But I want to work in web dev first, and then if I can't secure anything I would move to trying to find entry-level IT work. At the time of writing, I am working on my dev portfolio with a couple of projects in the pipeline using React.\n\nAnyways, enough background, my questions are, would potential employers disqualify me since I am majoring in something completely different? Would it make me seem too young to employ? Would it make me seem too \"busy\" since I am in college? Or would none of this matter if I showcase a great portfolio and have the right attitude?\n\nThanks in advance for the help. BTW I am a self-taught dev.","194":"Hello all!\n\nI am a Data Engineer who was able to make the jump from just your ordinary schmuck to someone that gets to write code every day for a decent wage.  I have a bit of a story to tell about my experience, and it might be a little on the long-side, TL;DR will be at the bottom of the post.  I will leave some bullet-points as well so that I can offer advice on what I would do different if I had a time machine and could start from scratch.\n\nNot too long ago, I had to close down my business that I was running, and I had enough cash on-hand to enroll into a Software Development bootcamp.  I will not disclose the bootcamp or my employer, this is purely a post to help out those of you who are at the stage where you are looking at where you may want to study.\n\nWhen it came to looking for a bootcamp, I really had no idea how to tell who was good and who wasn't.  All of my local options were priced in a similar range, and they all claimed a high (90%+) placement rate, with job-placement staff on-site to help you navigate the wild world of job hunting as a Jr. Dev.\n\nI ended up going with a \"cast a wide net with what you learn\" and \"learn at your own pace\" program.  What I found out was \"cast a wide net\" meant that I only got to learn a little bit of each technology we covered.  We went through HTML\/CSS, SQL, Javascript, Python and C#\/.NET in that order, with a heavy emphasis on .NET (and a little on .NET Core).  \"Learn at your own pace\" meant that we would be enrolling on online courses from places like Pluralsight and doing some skill checks and short coursework developed by their staff... of Jr Devs that ended up working there after they couldn't find a job in the field of their choice (this is confirmed by them to me, not speculation).\n\nWhat's that, you say?  You paid over 10 grand to enroll in online courses and take some coursework developed by people who have zero industry experience?  That's correct.  At this point I want to briefly stop and note that not all camps are like this, I think I maybe just picked the worst of the bunch.  Please don't be like me, ask questions before you enroll like \"who developed your coursework?\" and \"What kind of real-world experience does your staff have?\".\n\nOk, so that kind of sucked, but at least I was going to get help finding a job when this was all over... right?  Not so much.  Our job placement guy was a total disappointment.  While he helped us write our resumes (they all looked the same... more on that later) and did mock interviews, the actual job placement part of his job left a lot to be desired.  He never actually looked for any jobs for me or my peers, instead opting to send us links to meetups around town, which if you have been to them, aren't exactly job fairs (although the networking can be beneficial).\n\nWhen I actually did get some interviews (on my own, no thanks to my job-placement guy) I quickly learned that most companies do not want to hire folks like me with zero experience in the industry.  It is important to note that I went all-in on .NET, and was trying to get a job as a full-stack developer working with OOP (lol, I didn't even learn what an API was at the time as it was never taught to me or brought up in my coursework).  In one interview that I was able to secure, the interviewer asked me about my resume, specifically where\/how it was written.  I let him know that it was written with the help of my camp's job placement guy and he flat-out told me that he had received roughly 25 applications from my peers and our resumes were exactly identical.  No idea why I got an interview and others didn't, maybe he was just curious.  I didn't get the job.\n\nIn the post title I also mentioned not to trust sites that promote \"hey go to this bootcamp!\" or \"here is a great story from Unclematttt about his experience with going from zero to hero!\".  This bit is what actually made me want to make this post.\n\nThere is a LinkedIn power-user (again, not going to disclose their name) who reached out to me and was chatting me up about his cool site that helped people just like me choose their bootcamp.  \"Hey Unclematttt, I see you went to XYZ Bootcamp- would you mind writing a review for my site and maybe doing a AMA for our users?\"  I proceeded to tell him my experience was bad, I am pretty sure the camps lie about placement numbers (at least half of my 'graduating' class never even made it into the tech industry), and the job I ultimately got was more of a support role that was at my wife's work.  I actually had to grind my way up to this position by working double-time and developing helpful scripts and applications in my free time.\n\nThe power-user's response?  Silence.  I followed up a couple of days later to ask what their thoughts were, and they never responded.  I guess it didn't really fit the narrative that they were trying to push.\n\nNow that I have shared my experience, I want to note a few things:\n\n* There *are* quality bootcamps out there, I just ended up at one of the shitty ones (do your research)\n* The job situation in my city (known as somewhat of a tech-hub in the region) might not be the same as your city\n* I could have done more to build out my portfolio before applying to jobs and possibly giving a bad first-impression (don't be like me)\n\nHere are some tips that I can share that I think might be helpful if you are just getting into the idea of picking out a school\/bootcamp and want to be successful:\n\n* I sound like a broken record here, but DO YOUR RESEARCH on your bootcamp.  Don't put blind trust into what they are *selling* you.  They churn through students and their goal is to just get your money and get you into their program\n* If you are interested in full-stack development, take baby steps and learn everything you can about backend engineering first (what is\/how to build an API, how do applications interact with databases, what are the hot SQL and NoSQL technologies in your area to learn, what are containers and how do they work, etc.).  Full-stack devs do not just sprout out of the ground IME, it can take years to become proficient with any given stack\n* What stacks are hot right now?  Are there lots of jobs for ELK?  What about MEAN?  Find something that you like and go nuts on it\n* Personalize your resume.  Start with what your camp\/school helps you build, then do something (anything!) to make it different than your peers\n* IME there was more success with Javascript devs from my camp than anyone else.  Consider learning Javascript in detail and some of the more popular frameworks like ~~AngularJS~~ and Vue (I have been informed that Angular isn't hot anymore- I am not a JS dev, so my apologies on that, research what frameworks are popular in your area.  Edit: this is debated below in the comments, so again do research on what Frameworks are popular in your area.)\n* You will likely end up using databases in some way shape or form during your career, make sure you understand the ins-and-outs of various database technologies and how it applies to your stack\/languages of choice\n* Develop a solid portfolio.  If you are doing front-end work, this is a lot easier as people like \"pretty pictures\" (my opinion).  Make daily commits on Github (many employers will ask for your Github profile to check it out before deciding to interview you).  Also have a basic-to-awesome portfolio website, and even though we all hate it, get a LinkedIn account.  Consider buying the premium version if you have the cash for it.\n* Try to find a language\/stack that you are comfortable with and enjoy and go HARD on it.  Make sure before you make this decision that there are plenty of jobs that want those skills, there is fierce competition for Jr Dev roles, so you will need to apply to many of them (maybe even hundreds) before you land your first gig.\n* Make sure you are in a good place mentally before starting on this journey.  It can be soul-crushing at times, but there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel if you persevere\n\nI could write a whole lot more, but I think that this covers most of it.  Sorry for the long post, this is kind of therapeutic to write out.  Believe in yourself, but also take care of your future self by not making some of the mistakes I did along the way.  If I could do it, anyone can with the right amount of drive.\n\nTL;DR Make sure your bootcamp doesn't suck before enrolling.  Know the local market and what skills are sought-after.  Don't trust sites that paint a pretty picture, this whole process is a total grind.  Believe in yourself and put in the work.\n\nedit: Minor grammar fix.

The company is not interested in engaging in this process at all.

Why shouldn't I be allowed to continue with my pre-existing projects on my own dime\/time?! Sure, anything I do concerning their business is 100% theirs.

I was nervous, true, but I did my best to ask for clarification, get my partners' input, and write code based on all that. Pair-programming, as I was taught, is meant to be a collaborative experience and though we didn't get too far in the presented project I did my best to express my thoughts and provide solutions to obstacles, some of which my partners agreed with.\n\nI was rejected.\n\nNo one is at fault here, I think, but I'm beginning to wonder if I misunderstood the nature of pair-programming. Their feedback was something to the tune of \"\\[I\\] didn't really write the code\". To me, that means they felt they were working *through* me instead of *with* me and I understand why someone could feel that way, but isn't that the point? I had already shown samples of my work that pushed me to the next step in the process. I'd imagine this session was to see how I took criticism and could follow direction to find solutions. \n\nIs that not what pair-programming is?","220":"I am currently a regular full-time software engineer for a pretty small company. I\u2019ve been trying to jump the hurdle from SWE to Senior SWE for a while and I\u2019m feeling pretty stuck. Not a lot of feedback from higher ups, peers don\u2019t understand the pushback. In addition, the principal engineer on my team left recently and instead of adjusting timelines and searching for a new one, they\u2019ve kept all of our deadlines and dumped a lot of his work on me. I\u2019m capable of doing it and I find it interesting, but the pressure of the deadline is unreal and I\u2019m annoyed that I can be given that responsibility and not the title. \n\nI was recently approached by a recruiter for a Senior SWE position that is an 18 month contract. The project is interesting to me and the hourly rate is pretty big (No PTO so factor that in, though the consulting company does provide health benefits and 401k ). I\u2019m now in the final interview stages. I\u2019ve never worked on a contract and have always shied away from them as \u201cnot as good\u201d as regular, full-time work. \n\nIs it a bad to leave my regular full-time job for a contract position?

I see there are other developers at my company who know the business better but are less productive or efficient as a developer.

I'm working on getting back into the workforce after a three-year gap. I figure I should lay out all the gory details so I can get the best advice possible.\n\nThree years ago, I was laid off from my last job, where I worked for a little over two years as a data engineer. Prior to that, I worked as a technical consultant for two years at one of the big software giants (name omitted for privacy reasons). Subsequent to my layoff, my then-husband and I moved to my current city so I could begin a master's degree program. We had a nasty divorce as I embarked on my studies, which were going reasonably well until everything went remote. Coupled with my depression (which is being treated), the stress of the divorce and online classes forced me into a leave of absence from my graduate program, to which I may decide not to return in favor of finding a full-time job.\n\nThis is where I need some help. It's been a long time since I appeared for a technical interview, though I do have experience conducting such interviews from my last job. I have several books I am using as preparation materials (Algorithms Illuminated by Roughgarden, Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, et al, CTCI, and EPI) and I am also trying my hand at some of the practice interview problems on CodeSignal. I have always struggled with these types of questions despite my four-year degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, and I am finding the preparation process rather overwhelming. Furthermore, I am worried about the large gap in my resume. I suppose my explanation is reasonable, but how can I convince prospective employers to take a chance on me?\n\nI feel very alone in this process, and it feels like the odds are stacked against me. Would I be better off just returning to my graduate program (my leave lasts until January)? How can I overcome this gap in my work history? I would also appreciate suggestions on effective strategies and helpful resources for brushing up on my skills and becoming more confident with technical questions.\n\nDMs are welcome.","225":"Simple question here.

I think back in time, I applied for something that might be easier for me. Now, I feel like I\u2019ve wasted my time and money. Perhaps, I shouldn\u2019t have studied economics, and maybe I wouldn\u2019t have even noticed my epic mistake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see that my mates from my dorm, that study IT, already found some part-time jobs in their field, and they are just in their 2nd year of study. They\u2019ve learned everything at college, and now they can make some good money on what they\u2019ve learned. While I\u2019m struggling to find an unpaid internship with my degree, I will graduate with honors if I do good on my finals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I look for some jobs online, I see that almost every company requires an IT specialist and pays good money. While there are no offers for business and marketing graduates. I\u2019ve reached that point when everyone needs some work experience, but no one wants to hire me so I can get one. This situation became so ridiculous, so I even found a meme based on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the meantime, one of my friends sent me this link \u2014 [https:\/\/www.cardinaldigitalmarketing.com\/services\/seo\/](https:\/\/www.cardinaldigitalmarketing.com\/services\/seo\/) and told me that I can find myself doing SEO.

Here's my situation:\n\n\n- background\/backstory (feel free to skip)\nI'm in my early thirties, have worked almost a decade in tech consulting (implementing\/configuring SQL-based tools for things like sales management and accounting). In that time I worked mostly as an individual contributor, with a few years as lead consultant for some bigger projects (switched back to single contributor after a mini-burn out and deciding that being in meetings\/writing email all day wasn't for me).\n\nI studied computer science in college back in Europe (about a decade ago) and am currently living and working in Toronto, Canada in consulting for a large organization (I actually quite like the company, I started here about 2 years ago, they have decent benefits\/pay, though lately things have been changing slightly for the worse I find).\n\n- challenge\/goal:\nI would want to switch to software development, my degree focused on this moreso, but due to circumstances and emigrating I kind of ended up in consulting. I'm finding it particularly challenging to find time\/motivation to do side projects and coding after a full day at work (and I probably have some covid fatigue I think, measures downtown toronto have long been quite strict). In terms of prior coding experience: I got a Java certification a few years back and I have played around with  variety of language (Python, Java, C#, Cobol, Javascript etc.), but I find I'm lacking in recent and real world experience (as well as some of the supporting tools and technologies, things like Kubernetes or getting fully up to speed with AWS\/Azure and microservice architecture).\n\nI've spent the last few years thinking about making the switch, but have always come up lacking on the execution and I REALLY want to change that. However, I also know that doing this as a side project after work every day is quite likely to fail. For this reason I was thinking of enrolling in one of the coding bootcamps available here, they're quite pricey but I think it might be the fastest\/surest way for me to get into a dev role sooner rather than later, which will ultimately help with me develop the required skills further (I like\/enjoy studying and learning as part of a job and think I'm quite good at it).

I've been programming since I was 18 but I finally decided to become a software developer at 24. I've gone through Unity (C#) and Flash (ActionScript 3) for videogames, and also C, Java, Smalltalk for the basics at uni, then Matlab and other misc languages for misc subjects.\n\nI got my first dev job as a Salesforce Dev at the start of 2020. I'm not a complete beginner, but I still feel that I'm behind regarding experience. My other friends are working on other languages and technologies (JS, React, Python, Node, you name it), and when I listen to what talk about it makes me feel that Apex is just a bubble that won't teach me much about the software development world. I want to learn more are get bigger challenges. But Salesforce is not providing that for me right now, and I don't know if that is because my current company sucks or because Salesforce is lacking things to teach me.\n\nMy goal these first years is to acquire as much experience and focus on expanding my knowledge. I don't care about the money or the job position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now I'm being offered two new positions: \n\n1) SSr. Salesforce Dev for a really good medium-sized company that is one of the best in the country. The talk with the dev leader was great and he sure knew a lot about Salesforce. He put emphasis on that they follow good practices and develop high quality code. I'll be working side by side with this person and I feel that I can learn a lot from him.\n\n2) Jr. Dev at an international company (offering Java, Python, and JS-related jobs mainly) that is growing a lot these last years and offers an HR product to the biggest companies in the world. The coding tasks they gave me to complete were the toughest I've ever been given for a job application. The interview with the leader was also great. He reviewed my code and did excellent corrections. It also made me remember that I've been out of touch with the most common practices in OOP. I have very good references for this company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now I don't know what to do. I do want to move to other techs, but that can be done whenever I want and I don't want to lose a good opportunity.\n\nShould I push a little bit further with Salesforce?

I\u2019m not super creative to where I need to design the layout. I want to do something more technical but these crazy words just confuse me. So what else is there besides web dev, I\u2019m starting out with C++.","276":" \n\nI've been a .Net developer for many years and love the technology, but really dont like the majority of jobs I see for .Net. It seems like the market is quite saturated . Also , I'd say a majority of the .Net jobs these days are 50\/50 .Net\/Angular\/React and Azure based DevOps .. There are a lot of demands for low pay and many employers tell me how saturated they are with qualified applicants for these low pay\/high demand jobs. I know .Net is considered romantically appealing and so many want to learn it. It is what drove me to learn it in 2002. Although I was a VB6\/ MFC programmer prior to it so got into .Net before it became as well known as today. However, I am starting to think this may not a good trait about .Net.. It has this romantic appeal and corporations that use it have unrealistic views about the framework and expectations of those who use it.\n\nDespite Java, for example, being an even larger framework, I have found many jobs in Java are much more focused on specific development needs and realistic demands. Rarely do I see a Java Spring job description that wants you also to be senior DevOps dev, like I do with many .Net jobs. Good luck ever finding a purely back-end .Net developer job, they are basically non-existent.\n\nI am interested in a framework\/language that would be more lightweight, allow for more back-end focused development where I could become more specialized in one area of development.\u00a0 E.g. I hear a lot of DevOps people will do back-end dev with Golang and\/or Python which is focused on helping to build and manage microservices.\u00a0 Having to spend a lot of time with React on top of that is pretty rough, but that is what I am seeing in many .Net jobs.  I feel if i am stuck working a full-stack type of job, I might as well just migrate towards Node and have a full-stack JS framework, rather than having to deal with complexities of two large frameworks.. Also, the demand for Azure DevOps is tough , since my background is mostly AWS and I would prefer a role that is more focus on one discipline (web dev vs DevOps) than having to be full-stack web dev\/DevOps dev.","277":"Hello Reddit, \n\nI recently started a job two weeks ago as an associate full stack software engineer at the same company and team I interned with last summer.

I\u2019m sitting here trying to understand how all the code interacts and functions but I\u2019m having such a difficult time with it, especially since I\u2019m very new to Spring Boot.

Thank you all in advance","280":"Hey, so I've been self-studying web development, and programming in general for a year and a half now. I haven't applied for jobs yet, because I'm currently doing my one year of mandatory army service, which is not the point, but I wanted to get that clear. However, I've had 2 employers contact me on LinkedIn to go for an interview, one as a Node.js developer and the other was as a Back-end developer. And this was probably a very needed confidence booster, although I've had to turn them down because of my army service.\n\nMy problem is, I have not focused on one tool. Throughout my studying process, I've only focused on getting the fundamentals right along with learning how to build things, no matter what the platform is, nor the tools used to build them.\n\nI've avoided using Angular, React.js, or any other specific framework or library, and stuck with working on all my web projects using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I even avoided using Bootstrap. I have also studied fundamental CS and programming subjects (such as the fundamentals in topics like OS's, Networking, Game Development, Hardware Design, etc.), learned the basics of other languages (C, C#, and Python), and built small things using them, for example, I worked on Linux for more than a year, tackled building a small game in C and did it, worked on small desktop apps using C# and .NET to be familiar with an actual OOP language and a different platform, got introduced to XML, and it gave me a solid ground to work with SVG in a web app I have been working on lately, I also worked on a small Flask project with a friend and helped them debug it and get it live. Note that I've tried to tinker around with all of this just because I want to be a programmer before being a Web developer, which is very important to me.\n\nBack to the Web, I've only been building personal projects, using Node.js for their back ends, along with vanilla JS on the front end. Although I see myself more fit to be a back-end developer, I don't think I know enough to title myself as a specialized \"back-end developer\" yet. I also haven't worked with any specific framework or tool on the front end and I'm not a designer, so I am not sure of that as well. However, I can implement complete designs using HTML and CSS. I have practiced this trying to remake templates I find on the internet by myself and finishing most of them, but I can't actually come up with design ideas myself.\n\nI know I'm ready and capable to get a job once I'm done with this year of service, but the problem is, I don't know what I can call myself or where I specialize in the Web. I'm sure I can build things, I can tackle any problems in a web app, learn the specific tools needed to solve them. I've been through these steps several times and I've completed the apps, but I don't know if this is enough for employers. I see a lot of jobs with specific titles such as \"React developer, Angular developer, etc.\" and I don't know. I'm currently building my portfolio, and I don't know what the title should be. Should I go with a \"Web developer\" or is it \"too general\"? Should I go with \"JavaScript developer\"? Or would it be thought of as me just open to using JavaScript?

I was being trained and thought things were going well but recently my boss told me I need to step up and take more ownership of my work. Usually when a task comes through, I need help understanding what is even needed to be done as there are no tech specs on the ticket, just a quick description. After having a talk with my \u201cmentor\u201d (a Sr dev) about the task I am then able to start working on it, and along the way will need help here and there when I get stuck on an issue. Overall, I thought I was progressing and felt good about where I was at. My boss had another talk with me saying that the project they assigned me to is a little \u201cover my head\u201d and to keep my busy is having me work on QA work. It\u2019s sort of unclear what this means for my job or what to expect but I\u2019m not sure what to do. Currently, I have zero stress about work because the QA work I do is manual testing and I am able to clock out and forget about work. Whereas before I would never feel like I\u2019m producing enough code and losing sleep over solutions and getting anxious thinking about having to reach out to ask for help when I\u2019m stuck. The company I work for really likes me and doesn\u2019t want me to leave but I\u2019m also torn on what to do about my career. Should I accept this mental break and get paid well to do a job that requires not much thought, but lose momentum in developing? Or do I fight for a development job or find a different company to work with and continue forth as a dev? It\u2019s hard to say what I want to do because I am so comfortable at having an easy job and enjoying this mental break so my motivation is low at this point.","286":"3 months or so ago I joined a mid sized tech company in a developer role. To be honest, my first few months here haven't been that great at all, but I'm burnt out on the job hunting thing and I want to get at least a year under my belt before I leave so it looks OK on the resume. For added context, the company has had a massive amount of voluntary turnover and the company basically has no culture at all. It's very much a \"show up, work, don't socialize, leave\" sterile environment and I believe that has caused a lot of folks to find work elsewhere.\n\nSo I got an email from HR where I have to fill out a survey for my job satisfaction. They ask questions about if I like the company culture, how satisfied I am with my job, did the job meet the expectations etc. Then I'm told HR will go over these results with me in a 1 on 1. For even more context, this is the same company that had HR reach out to me directly and asked me to write a good Glassdoor review for them, these people have no shame (I did not leave any review for the record).\n\nSo my question is, how do I answer that? If I answer honestly (the company is pretty shit) I'll likely have a target on my back and I'll have to start job hunting again. If I say everything is amazing nothing will change and it will continue being shit until I decide to leave.

I worked with her to get some small projects on there to fill it out, but they're nothing impressive. I've been trying to encourage her to work on more in depth projects so she could have more stuff to put on her resume and actually gain some coding\/ debugging experience as well, but that doesn't really seem to be an option for her.

The company I'm working at is a large and has offices all over the U.S. but is headquartered local to me. The pay is relatively low ($15\/hr) and the company is a not a tech company. I'm not quite sure what fulltime employees make but I believe it's in the range from $50-65k starting.\n\nMy issue is that my boss has repeatedly told me that he is hoping to extend my internship and potentially hire me full time after I graduate next fall (technically I'm graduating a semester early) if things go well. While I'm super excited and appreciate this, I can't help but wonder if I should be exploring other options.\n\nI'm worried that starting at a local non-tech company might hurt me down the road when I want to move on. I also know that FANNG-like companies are more open to new-grads than other demographics. I'm concerned that it might be a mistake to just take the first job offered to me (if it is even offered).\n\nThe thing is that I have a decent GPA (3.6) but go to a virtually unknown liberal arts college in upstate NY. It might be hard to get my foot in the door coming from a non-target school and one with such low name recognition. However, I have some solid internships and projects on my resume and have made connections with multiple people working at big N tech companies. Also this internship will help me get even more practical experience.\n\nI know it's early to ask this question but it has been on my mind a lot recently and I'm wondering how valid my concerns are. Would I be stupid not to take this job if it is offered? Would I be selling myself short if I did take it? I'm not really sure what to do here.","301":"A simple search of \"Revature\" here tells me all I need to know, of course I will avoid them.

Some days are not fun. Some days you don't want to go to work.\n\nThat's life. I don't know what I can say to make it easier.

I was originally employed  to work remotely as they were a startup with a grand total of 1 other developer.\n\nAs the team grew, they got an office in a shared space (hated it, 1 hour commute there, 1 hour back) and I went there every day for about 3 months(?). Then Covid happened and back to remote I go.\n\nThey announced the return to office, a different office this time though. This one is closer (40 minutes by foot\/bus). We are up to 8 employees now (not including the CEO\/CFO), two of them work in **England**. Literally hundreds of miles away.\n\nI honestly can't fathom why they are saying I need to be in the office. I told him straight up (I have always been up front and honest, if not a bit blunt) that I can not afford the \u00a3120 in doggy day care per month.\n\nThe response was \"That's not my problem, these are the things you have to think about before getting pets\". I did think of them, I've been working and delivering projects on time remotely for 2\/3rds of my employment here, why the fuck do I need to be in an office?!\n\nThis is a company that I've been putting in 100% into for the past 2 years, working extra hours, going the extra mile. My dog won't be a puppy forever (how the hell can people even afford to have kids?!), but with the tone I doubt a compromise will even be considered.\n\nI've even been rejected a pay rise this year, I am currently sitting on \u00a330k per year, about \u00a34k less than competing jobs and my peers of similar experience.\n\nOur office is in an industrial block. In the winter it's cold as shit, in the summer it's hot as shit, the bathrooms are awful, there is no where to really eat because the breakroom is tiny  and there is a fucking gym next door that blares awful 100bpm dance music all day and slams weights. It also costs me \u00a35 to get here. So in total, this move back to the office is going to cost me \u00a3140 more per month.\n\nI am fucking pissed and now have to go through the hassle of dealing with this confrontation next week and I honestly can't be arsed.\n\nI've always read here that \"*don't be loyal and give them everything, because they will take it al*l\" but felt it was different here, but it's not. It's the same.\n\nI'll never work outside of my hours again and I won't touch a single thing outside of my department.\n\nNot my problem\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes it's a rant, I need to get it out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I know this got an overall negative response, but I thought an update would be in order anyway.\n\nFirst off, thanks to the person(s) who recommended I read over my contract. It actually states that I am indeed fully remote with the possibility of going into the office *one per month* for a company meeting.\n\nI would also like to point out, like another Redditor here has. I am in the UK, we have rights and contracts when it comes to work. They can't just *change their mind* whenever they like. So I have a right to be upset, I put in the time and thought into getting a breed of dog that fits around my working hours and got him as a puppy **because** working remote was what was agreed at my time of employment.\n\nAlso to all the people that say \"dog doesn't need daycare\" or \"just leave them at home and get someone to pop in to take them for a walk\". Yeah guys, it's a puppy. They can't just be left alone for 7 hours a day with zero stimulation.

Managers, do you expect your workers to always email you by the end of the day to let you know what they did? This is the second day Im being given things to read as I cant start working on actual tasks before my computer gets ready, and yesterday I sent my manager an email at the end of the day saying I read all the documents and some extra stuff, and I dont want to be redundant and do the same today.

The company only has four employees and only two of us are developers (the current director of technology and me). It is still a young company so we are still very actively developing the product, which is a web application used by large businesses in their day to day operations.\n\nYesterday we had a meeting and it was announced that our director of technology is stepping away from his full time position to a more part time\/consulting role where he'll only be putting in 10-20 hours a week. Later I was told by our main boss that he and the director of technology talked about how to go about this and the director of technology was adamant that I was capable of filling the role. He mentioned that he needs a few days to put together the numbers but then we'll talk about an increase in compensation since I'll be taking on more responsibilities. I'm not sure if my title would change or not.\n\nI am confident that I can do the job, but I am a little concerned that the compensation increase may not adequately reflect the responsibilities that I'm being given. I am currently being paid below market for the area especially considering I already had a ton of responsibilities, so I'm worried that the new compensation will only really get me up to where I probably should have been in the first place. I have also been in the process of interviewing with a different company in the last few weeks to try to get a better gauge on my market value but I'm still in that process so I haven't received an official offer from them yet to compare against, but from the looks of it I would be paid considerably more at that company.\n\nHow do I go about negotiating this if the salary my boss pitches to me is below my expectations? I only have 2.5 years of experience but at the same time they're asking me to fill a role of someone with 20+ years of experience. What is reasonable for me to ask for? Should it be more than a mid level developers salary?\n\nSome more info about the business:\n\nEven though its a young company that could still be considered a startup, I know that we're very stable financially and the last few months have been especially good to us. To my knowledge there are no immediate plans of hiring another person. So in theory with the director of technology taking a step back there should be plenty of funds to add to my compensation... Also for what its worth I really enjoy working here. Everyone is great and the culture is very relaxed.","308":"Hi all. \n\nI was wondering if any of you know if there is a ceiling to the amount of money a computer programmer (of any field) can make?

A lot of work I've done is system integration rather than hyper-specific low-level dev (although that I've done too).\n\nHowever, I'm still struggling to see how to transition my career from being a developer to contributing to decisions on *what* gets developed given a problem. I've joined a very young startup a couple years ago specifically to address this, as I was promised an influence on the direction of the company. Of course this proved to be not the case. Yes, as the person leading development of our embedded product I have a good degree of control of how things are implemented, but I have no input into the conversations around \"how we as a company can help our customers given our product\". Any promise of that in the future always get trumped \"temporary\" business needs of me needing to churn out more product as code monkey doing what it's told. All that makes me feel like I should be more actively deciding on a career realignment instead of hoping it would happen organically.

Originally studied physics at Uni, even went on and did a phd because I was passionate about the topic. Left academia and has been working as a developer in the whole \"Data\"-business for the past 6 years. I don't like buzz words but titles have come and gone so much, but just to give an idea of I am doing I have been called things such as data engineer,data scientist, big data develeper and even machine learning engineer etc.... The past 4 years I have been working as an independent contractor (zzp), as I enjoy my freedom.\n\nUnless a fellow colleague in the Netherlands corrects me, the tech industry scene is not great there. So I have mostly worked in Brick and Mortar companies (telco, finance, retail, logitistics, fashion etc..). While covid19 obviously meant externals getting laid off, and I was no exception there, it became also a blessing for my career as a lot of companies are seeking contractors in other countries. This is were I got a taste of working at a tech company, tbh still surprised they were hiring contractors. There is a clear noticeable difference in mentality between tech and brick&mortar people. It was an amazing experience to have such talented and motivated colleagues. More on that later.\n\nSadly, things are never easy, I was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer a couple of months ago. Unsurprisingly, I had to let go of my current contracts to prioritize my treatment. \n\nI am about three quarter into the treatment process now. It has been not easy of course. You think you will be the exception, and that you will overcome the side effects, but they hit you like a truck.\n\nSomehow by miracle, I was able to negociate a contract with another tech to start towards the end of my treatment. In the period of my treatment, I was approached as well by two FANG companies for remote permanent. Out of curiosity, I followed the process with one of them and was even invited for online onsite interviews. As the side effects were intensifying, and I stopped the process.\n\nWork has always played a very central role to me. I am very passionate. Being able to improve and push myself to master my craft is very important to me. Cancer, however, is making me question a bit where I want to go with my career.\n\nAs I mentionned at the beginning, I worked mostly at Brick and Mortar. While I respect the people I have worked with, I do think B&M are the worst and most depressing places to work at as a developer. I often like to compare IT departments with Coat Hangers. Nice to have in the house, looks fancy and it's fun to display your coats (developers), but of course you rarely wear most of them (i.e. you can easily get away doing nothing for months and nobody will notice nor care). Everybody is different and , yes, some do enjoy the peaceful life of low pressure calm work. In my case, I have always needed action. I spend quite a lot of time initiating a lot of projects while working at these companies. It always felt I was a mule dragging a cart while 3-4 other people would pull in other directions. As you may guess already, I definitely was not the greatest friend with my managers. I do, however, take pride that I worked on some of the most innovative projects. I count myself lucky, despite the fights, that my managers's managers always saw me in high regard and always provided me with great recommendations which allowed me to keep moving forward.\n\nSince the cancer, however, and not being in my twenties anymore, I fear I will not have the energy anymore to fight similar battles. The though of working as contractor again at brick & mortar makes me almost as nauseous as my chemotherapy. I don't think I will always be able to work as an independent contractor with tech companies. Possibly, renouncing my freedom and  taking the opportunity to work as an employee at FANG (Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google) could be interesting, but looking at glassdoor it looks like I would be making less than I am making now (at least if I have a decent year with 10-11 month billeability).  My problem as well is that I am not really interested in working as a manager. I love working as an individual contributor. Bossing people around does not interest me. I want to refine my craft, keep innovating and building exciting stuff. This is one of the main reason I am   less interested in working as a employee. Being an employee feels like you are stuck in some cage where the only way to grow is climbing the ladder. I hate all the politics and petty backstabbing for silly meaningless titles. I take pride in what I create, not whatever non-sensical imaginary title or how many people are sucking up to me.\n\nHow would people want to move forward?

I'm a  software developer (Junior Mobile Dev - I do mainly iOS but from time to  time I help out in Android project in our company). In November it will  be 1 year since I become professional developer, before I had an  technical cloud support role and been customer service in some VR games  places. So I'm pretty happy with myself and my progress through the  years mainly because I was programming for only 4 years now (since I  started my first studies which I eventually left for my Bachelor of  Informatics degree). Now I'm ending my Bachelor Degree in month or two.  I'm thinking about applying for Master degree in Germany or in some  other country in EU (Netherlands are on my list too :D). I'm from Poland  BTW so it is somewhat a big deal for me while I have really no love for  my country right now and always wanted to see how it is to live in some  foreign country for longer time. But it came to my mind: Did I really  need this masters degree? My studies right now aren't so appealing to  me, I learn much more in my job etc. I have possibility to work remote,  so I could probably just travel and work. What would you do on my  position? Do you think that Master degree will help my in anyway or  maybe it just waste of time if I'm passionate about my work and learning  by myself. (While all I learned for job interviews etc I just did of  pure interest, and outside studies curriculum.)","332":"pretty much the title.\n\nI started university in Fall 2020. At the end of the term, we have to formally announce our majors\/minors, but I'm not sure about statistics. I like the idea and the topics are interesting to me. However,  I don't like the process of creating\/adjusting neural nets with PyTorch. I just don't feel like semi-random modifications of the model to increase the accuracy by 2% (Kaggle) is what I want to do.\n\nWhat positions are more software-like but require statistics? I heard of Data engineers but some say that data engineers don't code but maintain ETL processes through specific applications. \n\nCan you give me an advice?","333":"I've been programming for a while - did a BS and MS in computer science at a non-California school (a good one nonetheless).

I feel like such a large portion of software engineers are elitist, and the major reason I came into this field, to build cool stuff, is gone. People just want the salary, hype, and clout and that's it.\n\nAnd especially because I'm in a startup world outside of silicon valley, i get looked down upon more often than not. I may just need a break. Has anyone else ever felt this? How have you dealt with it?","334":"To give a brief background. I was hired last year as an entry-leveled software engineer in a relatively new and small company. The software engineering team for my project consists of myself, another entry-leveled software engineer and a senior leveled engineer. I was told by my team members that they appreciate my efficiency and that I\u2019m always top of things. Apparently so much so, I was asked by my coworker to take charge of meeting our team\u2019s goals, while he focuses on some software improvements that he wanted to dabble with. I was confused because I always assumed our team\u2019s progress was a collaborative effort. I\u2019m also not a robot that can just pump out features. I already feel like there isn\u2019t an equal contribution from my team members, however what bothers me is that the expectation is for me to address it. Should I ignore the request and continue to just do my work?","335":"Hello, I am a student Intern working part-time for the State government.

Thanks.","340":"Hi folks\n\nI've gone through a good chunk of r\/personalfinance and r\/cscareerquestions for insight and the answer to the post title definitely varies. I was hoping I could get some perspectives while I weigh the pros and cons of potentially leaving my current job which I am very comfortable in. \n\nI'm in the late stages of an interview process for a Solutions Engineering-type position at a large, high-profile tech company. While I do not like to count my eggs before they hatch, I've done this before and put off the planning\/consideration until the offer finally came and ended up rushing on the negotiation piece. I've received great feedback throughout the interview process which makes me think that it's definitely appropriate to begin this kind of decision making\n\nTimeline:\n\n2019 - Got laid off from a job that paid 85k \n\n2019 - Found a job that paid 90k \n\n2019 - That job ended up not being a great fit at all, found a different job that paid 115k \n\n2020\/2021 - Got a 5k raise to 120k\n\n2021 - Entertaining an opportunity that COULD pay 145-150k if I play my cards right per the feedback I've gotten from the interview process so far. Offer will more than likely start at around 135k per [h1binfo.info](https:\/\/h1binfo.info) (roughly a 12% increase)\n\nCurrent Job:\n\nPros: Great flexibility with time off and sick days, 30-minute max commute one way, absolutely wonderful coworkers, caring and empathetic management, great team culture, opportunity to learn a little about a whole lot of things (jack of all trades master of none), you are pushed to get 3rd party certifications, literally no micromanaging, respect work\/life balance and do not expect work off-hours, and they do not fire people\n\nCons: Current role does not translate into a career unless you want to go into management for the department, locked into my current role within the company for two years (I'm about a year and a half in), you are pushed to get 3rd party certifications, little flexibility with working hours (day always has to end at 5 no matter how early I start), 50-70% customer-facing which I want to get away from, standing customer engagements which I also want to get away from, generally most of the expected tasks have become tedious\/boring \n\nThis job that I'm at is probably tied for the best I've ever had and I've never had this kind of support from a Manager before - I had something of a nervous breakdown while dealing with some substance abuse issues a few months into quarantine. Without any hesitation, he gave me a whole week off and checked in on me to make sure that I was doing well. \n\nWith all of that said it is definitely a difficult choice for me to even consider leaving the company. However...\n\nWhat I know\/been told about the new position:\n\nI will be part of a new department within the company so there is an opportunity to be at the start of something from the ground up (fast-paced start-up style type of growth), flexible working hours, will be about 20% customer work (no scheduled, standing customer meetings only working on tickets), 45-60 minute commute one way, could potentially offer a shuttle to the office (still WFH until further notice, probably until August)\n\nI'm at a point in my life where it would behoove me to make as much money as I can until the next big thing, which is moving out of the country and marrying my fiance. I'm going to a place where 50k USD translates to 200k locally which you can live on very comfortably for about 3-4 years so it would be great to max out the USD earnings. This company that I am applying to also has offices in that country as well. While there might be a possibility for a transfer, there are roles there that I would be qualified for if I had to reapply\n\nWith all that said if the current job I was at wasn't almost perfect, this wouldn't be a difficult decision. I've always followed the money throughout my career in tech and it's worked out well so far which is why I'm feeling like I should do the same here. I'm also considering having that big name on my resume as well. But this time is definitely different and I for sure am heavily considering how great management has treated me up to this point. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this and to get this far.

I have lurking this subreddit since 2018 and I cant believe my time has come!\n\nMy background is that I am graduate from a small college in Canada majoring in CS. I always believed that you needed coop to land internships but I was clearly wrong. I sent over 2000+ applications and went on approximately 50 interviews.

My CTO saw that I was hard working and putting in 110% of my work and decided to offer a paid position in the company for the summer.

Also if you can\u2019t get an internship or a FT job, work as a volunteer part time, you will make alot of connections and you gain alot of experience.

My company made all the new grads undergo a couple of months of basic training of things like Python, SQL, AWS etc. I finally joined my team in mid-December and after a couple of weeks of getting permissions, setting stuff up etc, I started getting assigned work from Jan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts been five months now and I have not really done much - the majority of tasks assigned to me are of one of these types:\n\n1. Bugs which have been resolved in other versions of the product, where I basically have to replicate the changes made. A lot of these are assigned to me with the idea that I will be exposed to diff parts of the codebase and get more functional knowledge of the product\n2. Minor UI changes\n3. Writing of some selenium tests which are pretty basic and generally follow the same format\n4. Automation related tasks - run an automation suite, analyze whether all tests passed. If not, raise issues for the ones which failed\n\nTo be very honest, I have gone into auto pilot mode the last couple of months. With the pademic still going on and the monotony of wfh, my motivation was completely gone. Back in 2020, I was interning at a 'better' company but due to multiple reasons, one of them being covid, I did not get a full time offer. Recently I had seen folks with < 1 YOE applying to and getting into some top companies which I had deemed unlikely as I thought companies would not be willing to hire someone who is between the 0-1 year mark in experience. But on seeing this, I started leetcoding and stopped putting any effort into my actual job. I had started basically copying the code changes which I needed to replicate without even trying to analyze them, procrastinate on the other work as well.   \n\n\nI ended up giving a few OAs (Linkedin and a few good local product companies) and did not get through them. On getting some advice from some more experienced people, I am considering staying put until around July -August when I can pass off as a 1 YOE guy and then applying again, and continuing to improve at LC in that time. But now its starting to hit me that it will soon be close to a year without me having done any actual coding and Im not sure what I will say when asked in interviews about my experience. I wanted to get this sub's opinion on this situation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone been in this sort of situation where they were not getting any major work as a new grad and their coding skills suffered as a result?\n\nI am considering applying to other places and am doing leetcode prep on the side. One thing which worries me is what I would say when asked about my contributions at my first company. All I can really say is that I completed my tasks(without being proactive tbh) and delivered requirements on time. Would this be accepted? I see so many people who put on their resumes about what they designed or built etc etc\n\nHow do I bring this up with my manager? Should I be honest with him that I had kind of slacked off the past couple of months and not been making an active effort to learn the codebase(which is insanely vast and I still am not confident with).","347":"So I\u2019m currently working on a greenfield project and I like my job but wish I was making more money.

There is also a strict business casual dress code and working remote or from home is very limited. \n\nNew offer: 95K, full remote, option to work in DC or Austin, TX if I prefer to have an office. Similar benefits although the 401k matching is a bit weaker ($0.25 per dollar up to 6% vs 100%% up to 6%). This gives me the chance to own my life a bit more and flexibility to move to a new city in the future without having to find a new job. \n\nI am feeling very stressed about this decision and not telling my current employer about the situation.

I recently dropped out of a PhD where I moved to a new country during this pandemic to start it . The issues I had with the PhD (in Denmark ) was the fact that I wasn\u2019t allowed direct entry into the programme and had to do 2 years of a masters to reach the danish standard and essentially after 6 months at it I got completely disheartened and burned out as i had to split my time into doing a full masters load , teaching and also planning and heavy prep work for the PhD . My issue was that I was working 7 days a week and having almost 0 time to actually dedicate to my PhD and with the lockdown rules I think matters just became worse as I was in a new surrounding without any support locked up and with very little social interaction or even free time and breathing space  .

I moved to this office with the aim to learn more.\n\nPIP - is Performance Improvement Plan. I know that it's given to an employee if he fails to meet the target for a period. \n\nToday, I was invited to a meeting with no subject which I attended. To my surprise, it wasn't about regularization, instead it was about PIP that I never was warned before.\n\nOur office is a contractor and has clients abroad. During the meeting, my manager simply showed a PIP form and explained that it's being issued to me because I didn't meet the metrics and expectation of client. That's when I started to get confused. \"No specific metrics were discussed to me since I joined\" I thought that I jist need to work on the task assigned to me per sprint.\n\nSome of the metrics\/target I saw on the PIP are about ensuring at least >=10 lines of code merged per sprint, ensuring that you avoid getting task carried over to next sprint etc. All of which were never discussed to me since I joined the company. And now, there I was in the meeting being issued a PIP right on my face when I wasn't even oriented about the goals. No warning, no monitoring, just straight PiP that they said I need to acknowledge.\n\nI expressed my confusion and feelings about it to my manager(contractor side) and he told me that they will help and that I just need to get through it. In other words, just accept it. And that they didn't know about those specific metrics of client, which I find a miss on their part. They just told me that my feedback will be communicated and feedback is appreciated.\nI got so pissed because I think it is so unjust and unfair to just issue a PIP to an employee when on the other hand it's them who failed to communicate to me what my metrics are. And I'm on my 7th month, not even a year. How the hell would I know those specific targets if they don't identify and ask those from client. There are sprints where there are only UX tasks. (I do backend btw)\n\nTheir miss, my record\/reputation's expense.\n\nSorry, I'm a little getting carried away.\nNow, I've been thinking that I wouldn't want to stay in an office with that kind of system and management.

Here's some issues I'm having:\n\n* First and foremost, the CEO is a bit nuts. He singles people out in chat and asks things like \"Why did you do this?\" \"Why didn't this person catch this?\" anytime something goes wrong. He flips out anytime there is any issues whatsoever, dropping F bombs in chat when something happens. He micromanages everyone. He'll directly message me repeatedly all throughout the day asking me to look into whatever so happened to cross his periphery at that time which he's now deemed critical. I don't get clear instructions on requirements from him at all.\n* I spoke with my manager about the CEO micromanaging me and he has backed off a little bit recently, but it's still there, and there are so many other problems with this person that just make it really hard to work with him.\n* The CEO \"doesn't do\" tickets, any message received from him in chat is good enough and I should drop everything I'm doing to look into whatever he's asking and most of the time it's way above me. I can't communicate with him through tickets either, I need to chase him down in chat anytime I need clarification on something because he never answers.\n* We have project managers that are absolutely useless. Everything is critical, everything needs to be done by end of day, no clear instructions from them ever.\n* Developers never stop working. This especially includes the CEO. I receive messages from him at 3 AM asking for my thoughts on things, or asking me to fix a deployment he messed up, because despite the fact I've done multiple personal calls with him to walk him through the deployment process, and written detailed documentation complete with screenshots, he still circumvents it, looks for shortcuts, messes things up, then flips out when everything breaks in the middle of the night because he decided to deploy to production.\n* My role isn't clearly defined to anyone else. Everyone thinks I'm the administrator of every single system we have and service we use. Anytime there's the slightest issue with anything I need to drop what I'm doing and fix it. It wouldn't be so much of a problem, but we have like 50+ random EC2 instances that were set up before my time and there is no documentation for any of it. I would love to clean this up, reduce systems, find better ways to run them that's more inline with best practices but I'm honestly just firefighting all day with developers and random other things that get assigned to me.\n* I have no time to really dive into some other things I would like to help grow as a DevOps Engineer. There are so many tools and processes I would love to research and attempt to look into but honestly with the way it's been with the CEO who doesn't listen, doesn't bother using processes I've set up, flips out when there's problems, I've just lost all motivation and desire to even try implementing anything else or improving anything.\n* I've been volunteered as the head of all security policies and runbooks, despite the fact I'm not actually writing anything at all it's being done behind the scenes without my involvement yet they put my name on documents.\n* No documentation for anything except for what I've wrote for the processes \/ pipelines I've developed. I'm coming from IT and have a solid background in documentation, it's something I've always placed a great deal of importance with.\n* No monitoring aside from some pretty useless CloudWatch alerts \/ dashboards we have set up. I would love to really dive into this area, and load testing as well, but see my point above regarding the CEO. I've honestly just lost all motivation to start on anything like this because of him.\n* No leads. No code reviews. Everything is under the birds eye view of the CEO. There are people who direct deployments, but they're not developers. There are so many issues with deployments I don't even know where to start.\n* Devs connect to production databases for development.\n* Things are way too fast. I'm talking deployments to production causing issues, anything I ever work on needs to be done ASAP as well. I'm not part of any discussions or meetings outside of the daily standups which are a joke.\n* Daily standups are absolutely useless. The project managers just talk about what's being deployed for 5 mins, while everyone else sits in silence in the call, but then I get singled out and asked what I'm working on and when it will be done. No one has any idea of what I'm talking about and it just feels so awkward.\n\nDespite all of the above, it honestly started out well when I was less in contact with the CEO. I got to really dive into Terraform and AWS, and had fun setting up and learning new things. The pipelines I developed were challenging but fun to work on, and I love seeing them in action. I love helping people, and collaborating with devs to accomplish this stuff with them.\n\nNow, I just look at the place and see how much wrong there is and I can't fix all of it. I can't fix the culture. I can't change the CEO. I can't fix everything I'd like to on AWS or our processes. It's all just such a mess and I'm so overwhlemed. I'm filled with anxiety every time I start something when there's something else that's being put off that I should do. It's unsustainable.\n\nI took the last week off and have been hammering out applications (I've actually been doing this for the past month), but I'm getting nothing back. I'm trying to go for DevOps \/ SRE positions and am trying to stay remote, but I'm not getting any interest.\n\nSo here I am, I have less than 1 year in DevOps, and a little over 2 years in IT. I don't know if I should keep trying for DevOps \/ SRE positions, or just give up on it since I'm not getting any interest back. I've thought about going back to IT, but I honestly don't think I have it in me to go back to something so service oriented.\n\nI'm so lost and just wondering if I should just give up on the tech industry altogether.","390":"This is a pretty dumb to post but I'm cringing atm and I feel out of place.  is it weird that I said yes?

But cooperate has started to turn me into something I'm not.","391":"I'm currently in the bay area, and have been planning on getting my career started here. There are many great companies here, but also some large downsides, like high taxes and house prices. If you wanted to own a home there, it would require a rather long-term commitment.\n\nSeattle seems like a good alternative. Less companies in the bay, but (somewhat) lower house prices, and no state income tax. Not sure how the job opportunities compare to the SFbay.\n\nAustin has its benefits, but I'm just not a fan of it. I've never been to NYC, but I don't think I'd like it either.\n\nGlobal cities like Singapore, London, Tokyo, etc would be cool opportunities, which could be interesting. From what I've read, though, the salaries and opportunities tend to be quite a bit less than in the US tech hubs.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on best places to work\/ advance long term in tech?","392":"I am looking to enter the Software Development scene. I have my BBA in Marketing, but originally wanted to get a degree in CS however this never happened due to my lack of knowledge of how college really worked (First Gen Graduate). I got my general undergrad coursework done at a local community college and then transferred to a state college, during this process I found out that if I wanted to get a degree in CS, that I would basically have to retake much of my general coursework as it was going to require that I get much of the foundational coursework done despite already having my associate degree. So essentially I was looking at going to school for another 3-4 years to get a CS degree vs continuing with a business degree in 2 years. Due to financial\/time constraints, I went the BBA route (and highly regret this decision).\n\nTwo years ago I graduated with my BBA and have been unable to find anything professionally in the field. I am about to turn 25 years old and am feeling like if I want to make a career\/field change, now is the time to do it. It doesn't help I'm not really interested in Marketing, but I am interested in software dev as I feel that it would be much more in my spectrum of interests and fit me as a person better. I have a little self-taught knowledge of python\/html\/css\/js, but nothing significant enough to gain employment. My hope would be to utilize something of my Marketing degree, potentially the UX\/UI knowledge that I gained during my studies.\n\nJust some background info: I am married and my wife and I both have income, I would be able to work part-time and attend school\/camp if the opportunity arose. She makes enough income to support us both if necessary for a period of time. I live in Arkansas, while there are not a vast amount of employment opportunities in my city, we live pretty close to Little Rock which has some SE jobs posted pretty regularly, though we would be willing to move if necessary. \n\nMy question is this, what would be the best route in my case to reach employment in the SE field?\n\n1.) I have been accepted to my local community college for pursuing a second bachelor in CS, my situation is similar to when I was in college the first go around, I will require all of the foundational classes and since this would be my second bachelor, I would be paying out of pocket\/getting loans to pay. Either way, I assume it would be helpful to take some of the intro to CS classes there.\n\n2.) Should I seek a masters degree in CS? There is a college here that offers a \"Master of Computer and Information Science\" degree online and though it prefers students who have a CS background, it does allow for non-cs majors to apply after taking a couple of pre-req courses. This option seems like a good choice, but I get unsure when I consider the fact that I most likely will be lacking a lot of the core foundational knowledge of CS.\n\n3.) I've also considered attending a coding camp though I am a little weary of them. I've looked into Hack Reactor\/App Academy\/Coding Dojo. I like the idea of getting instant industry applicable skills, but I've also heard\/seen some sort of shady stuff with some of the Bootcamps. I also wouldn't be able to lump sum pay for something like this so would need to consider the different financing options.\n\nWow, this post ended up a lot longer than I had hoped for, my apologies, and thank you for your input!\n\n**tl:dr- Non-CS grad seeking SE career. Would the best route of entry be a second bachelor in CS? Master in CS\/MCIS through potential online college or bridge program? Coding Bootcamp?**","393":"Good morning! I'm sure questions regarding \"getting started\" have been asked ad-nauseum (and I've been reading several), but I am still feeling anxiety and confusion on what to do myself.\n\nI have a bachelor's in elementary education and am one course (my capstone) away from my master's in education (I realized that I can't see myself in education, which is why I have not finished.) I have 6 years of teaching experience but no experience in any other industry.\n\nFinding a new job in tech (specifically software engineering\/developing) seems very interesting and lucrative, as I learned how to code in HTML and CSS back when I was in middle and high school to create websites. I don't know where to begin if I were to make this a profession, though.\n\nI live in Arizona and relocating is not an option as I have a family; how likely will I be able to find a job? Is it worthwhile for me to pursue a post-bacc in CS and possibly a master's to follow? Relying on being self-taught seems risky for job prospects and employers; I would imagine a bootcamp-type program would be better, but how marketable is it? Is it possible for someone to shadow or intern to learn and gain experience, or would I seem bizarre starting to ask companies for this opportunity?\n\nI'll also add that I have a good friend who earned his bachelor's degree in computer science and it took him a year to find a job. It makes me question if developers are actually in demand, or if the market is over-saturated already.","394":"With covid it seems like a lot of bootcamps transitioned to an online model so now you can access them from wherever.

My team's manager got moved to another team and my lead got promoted to manager. The lead put in his 2-weeks notice, so our team is basically manager-less. This is why our Director of Engineering is managing us right now.\n\nI've been working at this company for 8 months and had my first performance review comprised of nothing but great feedback. \n\nI had my first two 1-1s with the director, the first of which was very casual, but the next was a shocker. I was called out on:\n\n1. Having too many PRs open, closed, and in draft\n2. Having too many commits\n3. Too many comments from others in my PRs\n4. Pushing commented code & code with git artifacts in it\n\nIn my defense:\n\n1. Since the start of the quarter, my team has reprioritized a lot of work, and there hasn't been a discussion about what to do with the work that we all started. Also, I open a draft PR the moment I make my first commit on a branch. I do this for visibility, and in case someone needs to take over the work.\n\n2. I also commit a lot. Commits are my safety net. I use `git reset` tremendously throughout the day to go back to different states in the code I'm working on.\n\n3. The director mentioned that he expects senior engineers to have very little chatter on their PRs. They should be ready to merge with very little discussion. What he failed to recognize that were almost all of the comments on my PRs are from Hound, our linter. Rather than linting before pushing, I actually enjoy waiting for Hound's comments and fixing them afterward.\n\n4. Here I made a mistake. I've been forced to comment out code recently in some of our microservices as a temporary fix while working locally. I forgot to uncomment the code before pushing to GitHub. The director went through my commits and saw some commit messages like \"uncomment code\", \"remove commented block\", and reprimanded me for that.\n\nI've been an engineer for more than 10 years and no one has called me out on any of this. This is how I like to work. I don't see a real problem here. \n\nI can squash my commits, lint locally, and stay blocked when services aren't working on my machine. But I'm mostly concerned about why this director is calling out this bullsh*t.\n\nI spoke to my former manager, and he said it'd just be easier to appease him. But it feels like the director is looking for a reason to let me go by finding incompetencies in my performance. I do not want to work in fear or with paranoia.\n\nShould I have a chat with the director's manager to ask about the feedback and what he suggests I do about it?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**BONUS**\n\nAnother reason I think this feedback may be in bad taste is because of this:\n\nWe've recently been given one of those typical sexual harassment training assignments which were to be complete in a month (due, say, May 15). On my day off last week, I got an email from the director saying, \"I know you're OOO, but we need you to finish the sexual harassment training **today**.\" After checking my email, it was still due May 15th, not May 8th. I completed it, of course (to shut him up), but that still leaves me with one question: Why would this guy message me on my day off with such urgency to complete something that was not even due? It feels like he's really trying to catch me slacking.","405":"Hey guys,\n\nI got a job back in January as a developer for a reasonably well established financial company.

I know because I work with the outsourced team (they're embedded into the company as opposed to being a separate division). \n\n(Just a little disclaimer - all my co-workers are lovely and I don't think any of their comments or actions are in malice - they genuinely all believe you don't need to code as a developer and some of them are very experienced)","406":"Basically the title.

There's no HelpDesk or anything of the sort so they do not handhold you and wave numbers and quotas above your head.\n\nBecause of nature of the company I think the progress within it will be slow, but they use different interesting technologies and focus on networking a lot which I could apply in day-to-day basis.\n\nIf not for benefits + School which I will explain below I would chose this one.\n\n**Company B.)** **Customer Support Specialist**  \n32.000 Euro a year +5% p\/a bonus \\~ 25 days off full dental + health cover for me&fam + other benefits\n\nThis Corporation deals with GRC and in the last year they have opened a new customer support hub that will be the only support hub globally. They use random shifts with new employee logging in on every hour to ensure constant coverage and the job is being done via HelpDesk where the clients call to the customer support representatives.\n\nThey have again and again highlighted that they want technically gifted people to be selected from L1 candidates within about half a year so they can fill up tens of new positions as once again they opened this support hub semi recently so those positions are being made\/waiting to be filled.\n\nThey will be looking at numbers and I need to be by my station 24\/7 as it often happens with HelpDesk types of scenarios. Also they look at metrics and it scares me a lot because I would love to help people to the best of my ability instead of pushing them out asap.\n\nAlso, those strange working hours would more easily allow me to finish my Software Dev Undergrad where I miss only three classes that need to be taken during the day AND I need to get my dental work done.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI have about 25k saved so I'm not in the worst place monetarily but I'm not sure if I want to take the jump into a work I could potentially hate for half a year where I will know what's what or start looking elsewhere.\n\nThe first Job is more interesting but has lower salary and benefits, as well as possibly much slower progress, but I would enjoy it more and it would be more of technical challenge. The second I will be stressing over metrics over months and hoping they pull me over for something more technical than learning product from 'the kitchen', while simultaneously they provide better benefits\/pay and perhaps a career opportunity.\n\nSorry if I'm rambling, I have gotten zero sleep at night over this and thank you everyone for weeks of supporting people here which helped me in turn as well.\n\nThanks everyone!","414":"Hi everyone,\n\nI've been a game developer for ~3 years, and I'm currently a full stack dev and have been for ~3 years.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is from Hong Kong and wants to move back there.

I have applied to probably over 70+ internships for this summer to complete my capstone but since I only got one interview I am focusing more on doing a comprehensive project for my capstone instead for the summer and will be graduated by August. I really am not sure what I need to do to stand out more or what skills to focus on. I know and can operate in a wide variety of languages, understand the fundamentals of data structures, algorithms, OOP, and have a 3.8 GPA. I am just at a loss at what is holding me back in the eyes of employers. I think one thing that could be holding me back is a lack of projects, however I have been a full time student since the Fall of 2018 including the Summer so most of my time has been spent on getting through school work. I have been trying to put in work on sites like HackerRank and Leetcode a few hours per week just to keep my skills fresh in some of the languages I have learned in my education but I feel like that is not enough.

One that I can hopefully work after 17 or on weekends. Is this even feasible?\nPlease be nice :-) I don\u2019t have much choice over the 9-17 time thing but would love to find a way in which I can work and also do that\u2026 \nLet me know your thoughts :-)","417":"Hello guys, I am a self-taught web developer, I started learning front-end at the end of last year, I've landed two jobs as a front-end dev with REACT, both of the jobs were really bad(on the company policy part, one of them was against my rights), after those two jobs, I soon realized I am more interested in the backend development, so after quitting, I studied a month of basic backend knowledge and then landed an internship as a backend engineer in a start-up.\n\nDuring the internship, though my position was called \"backend engineer\", but my duty was actually using AWS CDK to do IAC for our service, I had a great time learning cloud services and knowledge about internet, and the crew was really nice to me. But because of the company's lack of budget, they had to let go all the devs including me. After this short but awesome experience, I was almost certain that I want to be a backend Dev in the future, so I started to develop my own side project.  I am an admin in an English study group and we hold events every week, I decided to created a web app to optimize the registration process so I started develop it with something I haven't tried out yet. \n\nRight now the first version of my app is done on the backend, but because of my friend (she's in charge of UI designing), my side project is not ready to be deployed yet, so I thought maybe I could demonstrate my backend code and get into the job market.\n\nAfter a week of browsing and applying some of the junior jobs, I feel a bit frustrated, I feel like I suit most of the junior job and still feel like I don't. I really don't know what should I do now, should I keep searching for the job? or should I learn something else? \n\nIf I should learn something else, where should I go? should I keep optimizing my backend service, or just keep learning new things? My friend always tells me to \"master\" one thing, and I honestly don't know where to start, I am currently learning data structures, CS knowledges and algorithms when I am not searching for jobs, is that sufficient? I've been considering maybe getting a AWS certificate, but I really don't know if it helps since $150 is quite expensive for me at the moment..\n\nI truly love this industry and the knowledge of everything about this, but I just feel so lost in this sea of tools, languages and knowledge.. \n\nWhat do you guys suggest?","418":"As someone who has just recently graduated from a CS bachelors program, I have no idea what benefit I have over someone who graduated from, say, only a bootcamp (all else being equal), and I have been having a hard time finding the answer to this question. The closest answer I have gotten is that 'bootcamp grads usually can't apply to embedded entry level jobs.' (No hate to bootcamp grads though. All respect for anyone trying to hustle to make something of themselves in this world.)\n\nI have heard so much rhetoric about the different types of jobs available to SENG and CS grads, and how those grads don't make 'software stacks'(MERN, MEAN, etc.) their main selling point as a bootcamp grad might. I have heard that once you start defining youself by these stacks, then that usually means you are a web developer. I don't want to become a web developer at the end of the day, but I don't know what to look for in an entry level job description that will keep me off that path.\n\nWhat I am trying to point out, is that there seems to clearly be some distinction about the doors that a CS degree can open, but looking at the market and job ads in Canada, I can't seem to see that distinction in entry level positions. Either the job ads are asking you to be familiar in some software stack and the job is web-dev related, or the experience and tech required is so absurd that I find it hard to believe that any fresh grad would have that experience. I have only checked linkedin job ads though. \n\nWhat kind of entry jobs should I be looking for as a fresh CS grad (and as such, are available to me as a fresh grad), where I would generally not be competing with bootcamp grads? By this I mean, what search filters should I be using to find such positions, or what should I look for in job descriptions to keep me away from jobs heavily applied to by bootcamp grads? It is hard to not sound condescending when asking this question but know it is not my intention.","419":"I am currently working as qa intern in service based organization and I am in my final semester about to graduate in June . \n\nMeanwhile I got a opportunity to appear in a interview of  another organization with higher package and good role.

This is going to be an explanation of my situation with a friendly request of pep talk\/advice at the end. \n\nBit of background: I graduated 4 years ago with a CS-lite degree. \nIt's focus being on networking and security with a side of information management. It taught me the fundamentals of how to troubleshoot effectively, think critically, and most importantly self teach. Now due to my youthful foolish college ways I graduated with a not so attractive GPA (2.7 but whose counting). As such I pounced on the first job offered which ended up being entirely SQL based. Though I had exposure to SQL it wasn't something I had known in depth. Despite this the requirements for the job were low as was the pay. (I'm not trying to sound ungrateful, it remains one of the biggest pride points for me though now being slightly seasoned I am aware what the standards for the industry are.)\n\n\nFast forward a couple years, I am still in the same city I moved to for the job. I have established friends and a girlfriend I'm very happy with, things are nice. (Enter life and uncertainty) The small software company I work for gets bought out and recent restructurings have made me want to look elsewhere.\n\n\nMy personal problem is that I've been on a SQL only diet for about 4 years now and getting mixed messages from the internet as to the viability of that skillset long-term. My preferences for work I have found are being back of house interfacing with customers as little as required though I can do it when necessary and get complimented on my people skills. What I want to do isn't being a BA or manager-type however it's to be a dev\/software engineer. I know I need a real scripting\/programming language to move into that but it's all so daunting. I've been saying for a year now I'm gonna learn C# (my shop is .NET) but have not nearly but in enough hours to even grasp the fundamentals.\n\n\nIn all honesty half the reason I'm even looking towards other jobs and at my career is I don't want to be stuck with the legacy doom projects all my colleagues are leaving me with. I have a general sense of what I want and now have urgency but I simply lack the skills to make it happen. Do I do leetcode? Do I get back to school to get a CS degree? Bootcamp? There's so many options and it's overwhelming me into a mode where I do nothing and simply try not to think about it.\n\n\n**TLDR; Database dev wants to be a real dev\/swe and is in paralysis on how to achieve.**\n\n\nGonna leave the tag as experience.....it's just the wrong experience haha....","432":"Fellow Redditors,\n\nI am a new developer who is just 9 months into [development.In](https:\/\/development.In) work, my day to day work just revolves around crud.I am very interested in coding problems solving.But i don't find any stuff i work related with searching, sorting or traversals.

I lost my job found contract work and I was out of work for a little while at the beginning of the year. Two weeks ago I started a new position after two technical conversation interviews. I was offered a new position and my gut feeling was to hold out and keep applying. I did not follow my gut feeling and ended up accepting it. Here is the part where I feel a bit baited.\n     During my initial conversation I was told this position would be on site and that the team was currently commuting to the location of the client (kind of far from the main office). I was told that there were other developers working on the project actively. On the day that I start I am told no one has started on that assignment and it may not even happen. My current assignment is getting up to speed with a technology (AWS) I have not worked with for the potential opportunity to work with a client. I've done a little background on their past teams conversations and it seems like a lot of people left last year due to no new projects.

I'm currently trying to look for other positions to keep myself ready in case of the worst case, but I wanted another opinion.

This is just a front, and entering a command will prompt them to switch to GUI mode because of some obscure error. Then the actual portfolio appears. Everything can be seen without scrolling as I have used a lot of GSAP to animate elements into\/out of view.\n\nThe general approach I took to present what I've worked on is the following:  \n\\- Give a broad overview of the project.  \n\\- Talk about the most noteworthy stuff during the development period (I get rather technical here)  \n\\- Show some illustrations  \n\\- Rinse and repeat\n\nNow, two weeks into the development of my portfolio, I am feeling some self doubt and I am wondering if my approach is any good.

(Good online courses recommendations are also appreciated)","525":"Hi all, I'm in really need for advice, so I hope it's OK to post this here.\n\nI'm a back-end developer with 7 years in exp. I worked in several companies, mostly doing APIs and dealing with dbs. I have a bachelors in Software Engineering + business, so it's like a weird combination and it lacks some areas of a \"traditional\" CS degree. I have also experience with working with front-end, although my skills are not at the same level of back-end, but I can pretty much find my ways of doing stuff in Typescript\/Angular. I also deal with \"Ops\" stuff, like CI builds, Docker\/K8s\/Helm, but again, not an expert. I can prepare images and all the like but I'm not a infrastructure\/network\/security expert.\n\nAnyway I'm currently in a job which the tech stack is modern and it's the only reason why I wake up everyday and go to work. The team is awful. Management is awful. It's this culture of blaming when things go wrong, no support and I'd even go and say a bit of 'tech bros' culture. Another thing that is bothering me is I get these huge tasks, not even a high level specification, just a \"wish\" of what they want. I try to make meetings, to find out what is it that they want, most of the time the meeting gets hijacked by one of them (the tech bros) arguing about something that we'll not need in 10 years. Then  I have to work my ass off to do things, then when I present my ideas or what I came up with they say oh but that's not it, or let's change this.. so the task that should be 2 weeks becomes months, just bcs I have no way to know what they want. Make no mistake, I don't work 2 weeks without talking about it, I post on our chats, i create documentation, diagram. But nobody seem to care and they only care later on. Frustrates the hell out of me.\n\nSo this has been going for over 2 years now. Recently I decided to start looking around for jobs and I found out this one which looks very interesting but it's completely out of my comfort zone. The tech stack is different from the ones I work with, and not only that, it's a different domain, I'll be developing let's say tools for other devs.  I already had an interview with them and will be having a second one, so I guess they liked me. It was very technical, about the tech stack I work now, and there was some other general questions. I liked the interviewer, it was fair and felt more like a good conversation.\n\nSo, now I'm wondering what should I do. I'm kinda getting scared of jumping and then finding out it was too much to handle. I stalked some ppl there and they all seem super smart and working with like 3, 4 different languages, doing all sort of different things and I'm here like: Why they are even considering me? I only know 1 language \"well\" + front-end but not that deep.\n\nI kinda understand that if they decide to offer me the job, it's because they believe in my skills and my past track tells that given challenges and new things I have always overcome them. I'm excited about it and I think it will be great for me as a professional to broaden my skills but the imposter in me is telling me that this is TO much and I'm panicking a bit :).\n\nSo I guess what I'm after with this post is: What you think about moving to a job where you don't have much exp with the tech stack? What things could I ask during the interview to assess if they are really aware of the fact that I lack knowledge and also if I will be given the time\/support to ramp up and become a productive member of the team? I'm aware of my fears and the shitty imposter syndrome holding me, but I'm afraid of jumping in, then been given tasks where I have no idea what to do and then not get support, specially now with Covid and prob not meeting the team IRL for some months. In the other hand it's not like it's raining cool jobs, so I'm also worried of moving then being fired or not liking it, and have lost what I have today. I have my savings and would be ok without a job for months but I would prefer not to be in that situation.\n\nSorry for the long post and thanks in advance :)","526":"So I am in college right now and I am about to be a junior in the Fall of 2021.

My dad is a security guard who works night shifts, morning shifts, noon shifts.. he is working whenever he's not sleeping it feels. I'm expecting an offer this Monday after getting an email entailing \"great news\" and a phone call from the company I interviewed with for two months, where I'll be making $28\/hr for really cool tech stuff. My dad makes six dollars less than me with fifteen years of experience (we live in NYC so that is really not enough to live off alone haha). So I dunno man.

This will be my fourth technical internship on top of other extracurriculars and hardships I faced (my grandfather died from COVID. also, poor grades lol), so I'm very happy, but do feel a twinge of \"something.\"\n\nI think I just want to give back to my family honestly. They're not bad people (well, my mom treats my dad as a ranting bag thoe). Only thing is that my dad is extremely tired and overworked for what he's paid, and both my parents don't clean up after themselves. Security guard work isn't necessarily hard but during the pandemic, my dad would say things like, \"If we die, we die,\" which implies that he doesn't think much of his life. Not sure what to really think or if I can even help him change that.\n\nPoint is, coming from a low income family to having pretty decent wages is like, mind blowing. I have such a hard time spending money because I'm used to not having much haha.\n\nEdit: The question is poorly written. I meant to ask if any other CS interns are making more money than their parents OR are advancing a lot from previously being low income - and are feeling weird about it.","529":"What looks better to other employers, having finished 4 COOP placements or having done 2-3 years of part-time work (relevant work to the area of study) while doing school?","530":"Hi!

I'm not arguing that engineers would be better at coming up with product ideas and the general direction, but I do think that some people are naturally good at ideas and strategies.\n\nWhich is weird because these types of personalities are generally the engineers at a company. And the execs tend to be more like salesmen or managers grandfathered into their high status role.\n\nIdeas people should be execs. Not managerial people. These are two very different types of people. One type is good at managing others, details, facts, schedules. The other is good at big picture, creative, potentially a bit disorganized, and abstract thinkers.\n\nYet every exec I talked to so far is just a glorified manager. And their ideas are (no offense) usually pretty bad. I've seen great products get shafted by terrible ideas piled on top of it by people who have no understanding of what a good idea or bad idea looks like. And you can see this in almost every big tech company.\n\nWant a great example? Activision Blizzard. It's clear the higher ups are not interested in making good games or they don't understand game systems. They are so out of touch with the product that it just seems like the perfect example of this. It happens on a smaller scale at every tech company. And it makes me wonder why these people even need to exist. These execs remind me of DeeDee from Dexter's lab. They just run in and start pressing buttons and turning jobs and making noise hoping that they do something good and can take all the credit for it.","534":"Does anyone know of a company that can offer a scholarship to an international high school student for undergraduate Programme in Computer Science.

I've worked as a programmer thrice so far and every single time, I'm facing the same problem - I cannot wrap my head around how to structure my days to still have a life. I've tried going corporate, I've tried smaller companies but the overarching problem remains the same.\n\nIn order to get to office at 9AM-ish, I wake up around 7:40 as my commute takes up around 40 mins in the morning and anything in the realm of 40min-70min in the evening depending on the traffic and accidents on the way back. So after I get out at 5PM, I'm home around 6PM, eat dinner and start my life around 6:40PM or so. In order to be able to live the next day, I have to go to bed around midnight, having prepared myself and sandwiches for breakfast and for work beforehand. \n\nThis realistically leaves me with 4 hours between 7PM and 11PM which does not sound _that terrible_ on paper but in reality, after work I'm so exhausted that these hours couldn't be further from any \"quality\" me-time. I feel like my brain is fried - both from having to _pretend_ to work for a large part of the past 8 hours (which I'm sure many people working corporate can relate to - though now working at a smaller company, I feel like the problem remains largely the same), and from the lack of fresh air and\/or human interaction during that time (I'm an outgoing person and I crave human interactions but at my previous jobs, the interaction was literally three sentences exchanged at the watercooler a day; now at this new job, it's the same thing - the guys I'm seated with in the room literally don't say _a word_ apart from \"Hi\" and \"Bye\" the whole 8 hours - and believe me I've tried to have them talking but having felt like I was conducting an interview again and again, I just stopped pushing). Also, I'm so appalled by any digital media after sitting 8hrs in front of a screen that the things I would normally do to unwind (watch YouTube, watch a movie, play games) are completely off the table as my eyes are dead and I can't even focus on those things. I feel both physically and mentally done and it takes me a good two hours to be able to do any focused, quality activity for the remaining two. \n\nIn my previous jobs, this escalated so much that I'd gained like 15kgs over my year of working there, neglected basically all my hobbies and hated every hour of my life both on the week days (because of having no quality time outside of work) and on the weekends (because I wanted to cram so many things that I wasn't able to do during the week over those 48hrs that I was constantly stressed and frustrated that I could not). I did learn some lessons from that job and applied them now (like preparing meals in advance, forcing myself to sleep right etc) but honestly, the effect of those seems pretty negligible in the big picture.\n\nSo now I feel like I'm starting to fall into the same cycle again and I don't want to allow it to spiral as much as the last time. How do people still have a life while working full time? Having hobbies, friends and relationships, running freaking marathons? I do have all those things but am never able to sustain them when working full time. Even now I can see that my running schedule starts to fall apart again, I'm playing instruments 1 day a week instead of the usual 6 and so on. Despite rigorously sleeping 7h+ nights now, still the thing I'd love to do the most is just go and have a nap (which I'm forcing myself not to as it disregulates night sleep afterwards when done that late in the day).

I did the same but didn't receive a reply from any of the recipients.\n\nWorst part is, there's another person who joined as a research intern at the same time who hasn't emailed the hiring manager. I think they're planning to simply discuss with their mentor, take the exams and attend meetings on the same day by rescheduling.\n\nI did talk to my mentor but they told me to follow the HR's instructions.\n\nI feel like I should've discussed it more with my mentor. I also feel like I rushed into emailing the manager. \n\nWill this affect my chance of getting a job offer from this company?  I feel like I've asked for leave\/ reprieve during the first week and so it will give a bad impression of my work ethic\n\nI've been beating myself up ever since I heard from this other person ( who didn't clearly share what they were about to do, but honestly they're not obligated to do that). I just feel like I'm too dumb to have unnecessarily asked for permission.","562":"So I interviewed with a software company today and they said I could start Monday, but right as I got home I got a reply from a recruiter from another company to interview with a hiring manager on Monday as well and I'm not sure what I should do...\n\nThe software company does pay $15 an hour while the other company pays $20 an hour and I will be mainly designing a memory module in an Applications Engineering role. I just finished my freshman year in computer engineering so both roles would help out a lot, one on the software side, the other on the hardware side of things.\n\nShould I ask the software company to delay my start to see if the other company would hire me? Or should I just apologize to the other company and stick with the software role for this summer?","563":"I do both the front end and back end for the projects in my company, but I just follow the guidance of my senior, and I do not responsible for deployment, secrets config and environment settings (Those should be important things but my seniors take over them).\n\nLike my seniors would tell me the business logic, and the relationships between entities, then I would base on that to build the database schema, and write apis for the front-end. Then the other senior would go through the front-end design with me, and discuss the solutions if I have any questions about certain page, otherwise I would just develop the front end based on the design graphics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wonder if I can name myself as a full-stack though, I think I know parts of the full-stack knowledge but just not enough to be handling all of the things without my seniors.","564":"Hi everybody!\n\nMy 26yr old S.O has a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from a school in Thailand and she has been having great trouble finding a full-time job in the USA since she moved here to live with me (\\~2 years ago). The best she could find was an unpaid internship as a web developer at a crypto startup, but she isn't happy with that job since it doesn't pay anything, so she currently works part time as a licensed massage therapist. I am also in fact a computer engineer, currently working as a video game programmer at a indie gaming company.\n\nMy S.O applies to about 10 jobs a week and has applied for over 300 places now, I think. She has gotten like 3 interviews in 2 years of searching. I have worked with her to revise her resume at least 4 times to no avail. She has setup accounts all over Monster, Indeed, Angelist, etc.\n\nPossible reasons why she has trouble finding interviews\n\n1. Resume is probably not written well.\n2. Her college is unknown to pretty much everybody in the U.S.\n3. She doesn't have any full time work experience in the U.S. as a programmer at a well known company.\n4. She is here on a long-term green card (she sometimes puts this on her resume).\n5. COVID impacting hiring.\n\nIs there anything she can do to improve her odds of finding a full-time web development job in the U.S?\n\nMy only advice:\n\n1. Get her resume professionally written.\n2. Get a masters in computer science from a well known U.S. university.\n\nI would love to hear experiences from other immigrants who might be in her shoes and if\/how they have overcome it.\n\nThank you.","565":"I got a few offers for some companies but some of the employees gave me weird vibes and it is making me second guess taking the offers. The companies are good and pay well, but the people are just skewing my choice to accept it.\n\nCompany A pays really well and I am passionate about the product. I reversed searched the hiring manager's github profile picture and his account on a furry website came up. I felt a weird vibe when I was talking to him during the hiring process and I guess this could explain it.\n\nCompany B is fully remote, pays well, and the product is pretty cool. I spoke to the team and they were all socially awkward and it felt like a bunch people who were bullied in grade school were put into one room. I also spoke to the software director and he had ZERO social skills. He conducted reference checks and my old manager was asking me how the hell he became a director.\n\nCompany C pays really well and everything is fine, but I'm not that passionate about the product as the previous two companies.\n\nIf anybody was in a similar situation, how did you determine what to value? How important is social skills from your coworkers on a day-to-day basis?","566":"Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently a first year college student attending a pretty good Jesuit University in the north east of the US and I'm majoring in Computer Science. I intend on doing an accelerated program where I get my bachelors degree in computer science and masters degree in software engineering within 5 years. My bachelors tuition is practically completely covered with a full tuition scholarship, I am a commuter so I do not pay room and board, and my masters will hopefully be covered with a graduate assistantship of some sort. Therefore, I will likely be debt free by the end of my education.\n\nThat puts me in a great position of not being in any debt out of college with a bachelors and masters, as I also have fully financed a car that will hopefully last me the next 8-10 years. Therefore, the next step would be to move out of my parents' home and find somewhere to live. For years, my dream has actually been to live \"up in the sky\" in a highrise in a beautiful city, and many of the top tech cities in the country are ludicrously expensive to the point that software engineers may not be able to afford to live in them. Something that has been heavily weighing on my mind is the fact that I ultimately hope to move to Miami, Florida, in a high-rise condo (not apartment) ranging from $2000-$3000 per month, but from my research, it appears as if Miami is not a big tech city and the engineers\/developers do not get paid as much as engineers in, say, the west coast. I'm at a loss because living in the west coast in a highrise in a city is nearly double or triple the cost of doing the same on the east coast, but the salaries are much higher over there. I'm unsure if this dream is unrealistic in my 20's, but I want to do anything I can to set myself up to make it happen. I've lived in a crammed house my entire life, and the idea of living in a cozy condo with beautiful views is peaceful to me. Additionally, I am in a relatively long-term relationship, and my girlfriend is on-board with the plan and going to school for registered nursing, however I am unsure if it would be wise to finance the condo together rather than pay for it myself. Any advice would be appreciated on anything!","567":"I'm a Senior Software Engineer (just got the promotion) at a startup (2 years 8 months exp). We're a development team (6 members and expanding now) in Asia working on a Swedish project. I joined the company on August last year.  \nMy salary was ok but I got an offer from another company and I let know my CEO. Then he offered me more (almost twice as which I was getting at the company) and promoted me to Senior. Even before that both CEO and Team-Lead have mentioned to me that I'm exceeding their expectations and they're very happy about my performance. But I thought it was just something to keep me happy and keep tied to the company without any pay raise. But apparently, it wasn't.  \nAfter the promotion Team Lead contacted me and mentioned that I'm performing well and I can be his right-hand man hereafter and said that he'll assign some advanced stuff to me which he was working on but now he doesn't have much time to work on since the team is expanding. I was surprised since there's already another Senior (at least 2 years more exp than me) who has joined the company way before I joined. But anyway I felt so good he choose me over other seniors.   \nWhat worries me is the company is very flexible. We just have to complete 40 hours per week and for more hours we're getting OT. But now considering the pay (which is now way above the market) I don't need to work OT. But I'm not sure how to proceed with the new responsibilities. Any advice, tips would be greatly appreciated.  \n\n\n  \n**TLDR** : *Promoted to Senior Software Engineer and chosen as the right-hand man of the Team Lead, over 2 devs who joined the company way before me and have more experience. How can I impress the boss and do good for the promotion?*","568":"I left the Army in 2008.  I'm about to graduate, and I'm told that the best way to get jobs that don't demand 50~60 hours a week is to look for government jobs or government contractor jobs.  I'm told that many of these jobs require a security clearance.  When I was serving I had a Secret level clearance and a 10-level need-to-know.\n\nHas it been too long since I served for that to help all that much?","569":"I get shit done, but I'm slow as hell and there are large gaps in my knowledge that keep me out of certain conversations and decisions (and contribute to my speed much of the time) I make six figures in a relatively low cost of living area so life is good but I know some of y'all are getting wildly rich on total comp. I'm smart enough to work anywhere if I put my mind to it and stop wasting time, so what do you recommend for getting there?","570":"I'm currently looking for a career change, and have found an interest in UX Design. I have a bachelors degree in Cognitive Science, so do feel like some of my past knowledge could be relevant, as well as many many years of customer service, which I've found can be applied to the UX field. \n\nI was beginning to look into UX design on my own, but came across the New York Institute of Art and Design. After researching many programs,  it seems this one is actually one of the more affordable ones. Does anyone have experience with their program and what job prospects might be after completing it? I'm also open to any advice you may have on getting into the field. Thank you.","571":"Hi all,\n\nSo I am in a strange situation. I got accepted to go to PT school about a month ago and was supposed to start in the fall of this year. However, my national guard unit got surprised with a deployment that's going to be from Oct 2021 to around September of 2022. This means I won't be able to start PT school until Jan of 2023.  I will be honest and say it does have me down in the dumps since I applied specifically after being told this deployment wouldn't happen but now it is. \n\nNow since I will be spending a year in Kuwait doing basically nothing (and will have internet access most likely) I have been looking at what I can do to not make that year a waste of time. Looking at CS vs PT I noticed how much more upward mobility and flexibility there is in the CS career field compared to PT. Also not to mention not having to go to PT school for 3 years which means no income at all and maybe some debt even with the military paying for schooling. \n\nI have always liked computers and have built many systems, but I have zero experience with code. If I applied myself over the course of a year would I be able to become proficient enough in the an area of CS to possibly switch career fields and work my way up from an entry level position in the future? If so what path should I take to go from learning to applying what I learned to looking for a job? And of course is it even a good idea to think about changing careers when I have an acceptance letter in hand to PT?\n\nAny input is appreciated. Thanks everyone","572":"I\u2019m currently a junior in college pursuing my degree in finance. However after some consideration I\u2019ve decided to drop out and start my CS career.

It's not that I need to work with people my own age, but I kind of wish I were able to relate to my colleagues more. It feels kind of isolating always being the guy who is 10-25 years younger than the rest of the developers.\n\nThe majority of my coworkers only really talk about their families, their commutes, doctors appointments, and other mundane things. I've always been treated like the naive young guy (at 27, I'm not even that young anymore). \n\nI don't want to sound like I think older developers are boring and impassioned either. I've worked with really cool seniors who still lived and breathed programming and technology at 40+. They were always the most skilled and distinguished engineers at the companies I've worked at, but they were also a minority among the senior technical staff.\n\nIs it wrong to feel like I'm missing out by not working with slightly younger developers? Shit, the only friend I made at my first job was the lead engineer, who was second youngest guy at 35. What do you guys think?
