        "body": "Hi to all my fellows EE, I have a question to ask about the possible career paths that I could take as an EE in the discipline Computer-Hardware Engineering and Electronics. I'm in my final year and I would like to know what kind of job positions can I look for on the global market. At the moment where I am, there are mostly job offersing as Quality Control Engineer in IC manufacturing or in the telecommunication sector as Tech Support/Admin Specialist or System Specialist. Other alternatives are the software development, but that isn't what I'm particularly looking for. My question is, if I accept any of these job positions atm, what are my chances of building a future career in the field of VLSI Design, Digital Design, Embedded Systems, etc.? Can I find a job more easily if I had any job experience or do I need to have experience in these specific fields so I could search for a job position globally? Thank you for your replies.",

I'm sure this is normal but I'm absolutely over the moon that there's interest, even if all 3 opportunities will lead to nowhere.\n\n**Quick background of the companies:** One position is within the government, the other is with one of the big telecom giants, and the third is a pretty established startup that raised $10M last year. In order of preference, I guess it would be startup -> telecom -> government but since it's literally my first job out of uni, anything is honestly okay. They also pay around the same amount with the startup paying a bit more I imagine. However, the government & telecom positions are Jr SWE positions while the startup is a standard SWE position.\n\nHere are some of my questions & concerns\n\n* Do I tell each company that I'm also currently being interviewed by 2 other companies or do I say nothing?\n* I feel like the government position and the telecom position will have a very quick and easy interview process while the startup might be longer and include typical rounds of leetcode. If this is the case and I get an offer from the government/telecom but I'm still in the process of interviewing with the startup, what do I do?\n* In terms of salary, I've read some posts where people have leveraged offers to get more money. Is this something I should even attempt as a new grad without much experience?\n* Given the choices of the three opportunities, which would you pick? Government, Telecom, Startup?\n\nThank you!

I'm intrigued by the fact that they primarily use OCaml for the sake of code clarity and from what I know the culture seems pretty good. I do also know, however, that it's notoriously hard to get into. I'd like to know if anyone has any insight on how to maximize chances of getting in like what to put on my resume, what things to study and practice before the interview, etc.\n\nA bit about me, I'm a math major with a CS minor with 3.7 GPA from an alright-to-decent school. My work experience consists of one data science internship where I didn't do much and I currently work at Amazon and approaching the 4 year mark so I want to switch to something else once I get all my stocks. I don't really have any side projects and wouldn't call myself a super good programmer, I am only particularly comfortable in Java and Python and don't know many software engineering tools other than tools internal to Amazon. To be honest I think I lucked out on my Amazon interview because my raw programming skill is kind of weak. However I am decently good at puzzles/riddles and so I think I can understand complicated algorithms conceptually but I would need to practice a lot to be able to code them out. I never did competitive programming or anything like that but I did well in advanced algorithms courses which were based on pseudo code and proofs and diagrams. Also, as a math major, I found big O to be pretty easy compared to the kinds of math I did in my program. I don't think I would have any trouble analyzing the run time of programs and finding places where there could be optimizations.\n\nI'd be super interested in knowing what my chances of making it to the interview are and if anyone has any ideas for things I should practice or improve on to maximize my chance of getting in. I heard that Jane Street doesn't usually interview people who failed an interview with them before and so I'd like to get it right the first time. And while I went to a pretty good school I don't think it's a target school so that also hurts my chances, and I'm not sure what their GPA cutoff is or if there even is one. But I think my math background could be appealing to them. Any advice would be super appreciated, thanks!",

I am not sure the team knew that I was joining LOL I would say this financial company would be considered the top bank/investment institution in the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe team at the tech company is a customer data backend-focused team.

I ended up leaving my next job due to wanting to work in a different technology stack. The next place I worked put me in a position where they cut my pay massively hoping I would quit so they didn't have to pay me unemployment due to me underperforming in my position and I just got let go from my job yesterday where they claimed \"the company was going in a different direction\" and they wanted more senior level developers on the team.

I decided I could escape blue collar life by learning to code more professionally and I did. I got a job at a healthcare company writing SQL and SSRS reports. 3 years later I got promoted to a new position working with MS Dynamics. \n\nThe company and culture, while corporate and corny at times, is anything but toxic. I feel valued and rewarded for my hard work. Management is supportive and it\u2019s a very collaborative atmosphere. Office politics exist I\u2019m sure but I don\u2019t have to worry about them. PTO is generous and so is the pay. \n\nBut I just can\u2019t focus. I\u2019m just not interested in any of this shit. It was the same with both the SQL and dynamics positions, which as tools are both fine and kind of fun to work with, but in the context of healthcare and the corporate world I just really have trouble staying on top of all the meetings, different projects, terminology, processes, ect. I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed. I swear to god sometimes a meeting will just land on my calander with zero context and people will talk to me as if I\u2019m an expert in whatever it is they\u2019re talking about but I literally have no clue.

I the meantime 6 other things will be piled onto my plate. Sometimes I finish shit without understanding what I did or what it\u2019s for.\n\nMy honest feelings are that I don\u2019t give a shit about my job.

My activities included developing userspace services, custom libc and some S/W parts of the proprietary kernel. This was a job I really liked; the only reason I left it was a lack of understanding how tech processes should work. For several years, me and many my colleagues tried to change the situation, with little to no success; when most of talented colleagues left, I felt that the project stagnates, and also took an uneasy decision to leave.\n\nAnyway, even after some months passed, I feel that I really miss what I did there. I really liked the job, only political questions or absurd management made it less attractive. I would really like to find some project which is concentrated around the stuff I used to do. I'm particularly interested in concepts like capabilities, TCB, object-oriented; OSes and frameworks which attract me most include Fuchsia, Capsicum, Windows (not API-wise, though) and similar. I mostly dealt with C over these years; my C++ skills are rusty. Anyway, language is not a problem, I can learn new languages as well; I simply prefer C.\n\nAn ideal project would be:\n\n* An operating system which is aware of Orange Book and TCB, and tries to follow these principles to at least some extent.\n* Mostly userspace activities, like libc development, implementing miscellaneous services, perhaps even RPC to some degree.\n* It'd be perfect if I could operate on kernel/userspace boundaries, e.g. implementing new system calls or other kernel<=>userspace interfaces.\n* Preferably the significant part is written in C, which I know much better than anything else; other languages are not a problem, the C is simply the favorite one.\n* The project has some space for an architect.\n* The job is remote.\n\nOf course, I realize that it's rather difficult to meet all these criteria; I mostly shown them for an illustration of what I like and prefer. I tried investigating many jobs available, but, given somewhat narrowed scope, it's difficult to find something. Most vacancies for C developer I checked deal with either firmware or hardware; whilst I'd really like to become proficient in these areas as well, I'd like to at least start with fields where I feel myself already proficient enough. That said, I'm OK to use languages other than C, and participate in projects which deal with other userspace parts; above is an ideal image of the world, I realize it's close to impossible to find something that specific.\n\nI'm struggling to find something which matches my interests, and would be glad for any tip. Finding a job which matches these criteria via search engines is difficult, if not impossible, but perhaps real people can give me an advice?\n\nUPD: I also should mention that quite a lot of my activities recently concerned taking architectural solutions, publishing designs on implementations and similar actions.",

My Chinese is getting a bit rusty so I might have missed a few details, but this seems to be what happened: \n\nThere's this intern from Peking University who worked Jan - Apr and told her leader that she wants to leave in April because they're busy with graduating. The leader said no because she didn't find a replacement for her position and told her to keep working. After May 1st, a junior of the leader's joined the team, so OP wrote a 10,000 character transitional document and asked to quit on May 11th again, but the leader said that OP still couldn't leave because the backup wasn't found by the OP. On top of that, the leader said to OP that their working skills are really bad and they have to find two backups (replacements) to fill the holes in her work and questioned OP why they couldn't find a replacement when everyone else could. \n\nOP's post then goes into detail about legality (no mention of needing to find a replacement before leaving), violence at the workplace (OP's roommate's leader told the roommate that \"leaving without finding a replacement is irresponsible\", and when OP brought this issue to HR, HR said that OP was arguing about semantics / denying that the leader had said such a thing), why they needed two backups (was she doing two people's work?), and double standards (a roommate of hers didn't need to find a backup to leave, so why would she need to?). \n\nHope we can have a discussion about this here.\n\nEDIT: Sorry about using \"she\" in the title.

        "body": "&#x200B;\n\nHey. I graduated from university a year ago and have been working for a year as a back-end engineer. I was applying during peak COVID so I took the first decent job I found. The work is ok for me (I like designing APIs), the people are great, the work-life balance is impeccable but for my experience and skillset, I'm being grossly underpaid ($72k/y +8k bonus) (HCOL).\n\n I don't think there is much room for working on newer projects at my current company (cut and dry, develop this feature, fix this bug, etc).  I very much want to leave for a company that will pay me more, and allow me to work with engineers that I can learn from. The only redeeming quality about this company is that I only have to work like \\~15h a week MAX. No micromanaging.\n\nI know that I'm being underpaid, so I've been grinding LC for the past 3 months and I'm making steady progress. I've been taking all the SWE interviews I can get just for the practice and recently I've been offered a glorified Sales Engineer job. The comp is \\~120K + 15-20k bonuses. This is basically 50K more than I make now. The role doesn't sound very appealing, but from what I can gather they want someone to come to develop tools and scripts to automate their demo environment (so there would be some SWE). \n\nRegardless, I would still keep grinding LC if I took this job because I don't want to end up in the sales engineering world. **Will taking this job hurt my ability to pivot back to a pure SWE role?**  Would you give up insane WLB + vacation days for 50K for a temporary role as a sales engineer?\n\nRight now I'm still confused. An extra (50k / y) would be extremely great, I just don't want to hurt my ability to get back into an SWE role... \n\nAlso, this company I'm currently at is working at knows I want a raise, and I've been vocal about it but I'm met with nothing but lip service.\n\nTLDR: \n\noption A: stay at current company, maybe get a 10-15k raise within the year, continue to work on CRUD APIs but not work with newer tech stacks / develop my skills that much.\n\noption B: go to company B, make $50k more at least, and do something I also don't particularly enjoy, that moves outside of the SWE world, and continue to study.",

My manager and teammates are great and I get along very well with everyone. I use a modern, in-demand tech stack and am paid well above market rate. With that said, my time here has been extremely challenging. I work longs hours yet am doing much less coding than I anticipated. The breakdown is approximately:\n\n30% \u2014 Development. We do not have dedicated QA or ops teams, so a good portion of this time is spent either testing or handling build/deployment issues.\n\n25% \u2014 Docs, investigations, proposals, etc. Every change at this company requires time-consuming processes and external approval.\n\n20% \u2014 On-call activities. We have frequent week-long stretches of 24 hour on-call where getting multiple pages per day is the norm. We are expected to work a backlog of on-call-related tasks when not actively working a page, so I do not touch code while on-call.\n\n15% \u2014 Monotonous, repetitive tasks. This includes enabling feature flags and manual testing for things that we cannot automate.\n\n10% \u2014 Meetings.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how normal this is for a junior, but I suspect it is not normal at all.\n\nI have discussed the issue with my manager multiple times. He pays lip service to correcting the imbalance but I feel that I am stuck in an endless cycle of activities that are not enriching my skill-set as a developer. I have some interesting projects lined up but they require many hours of investigation and proposals before I\u2019ll touch any code.\n\nMy biggest concern is that my experience looks good on paper but, in reality, is lacking. Future employers may expect more from me than I am capable of delivering, given my sub-par experience at my current job.\n\nI am not sure how long I will stay with this company; I am in my 30s and want something more laid back and without so much on-call. However, I worry about leaving my first job too soon and how this may be perceived by future employers.\n\nIs this what modern software development is like at big companies? Am I doing something wrong? Is there anything I can do to improve my situation?\n\nAny feedback is very much appreciated.\n\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone who has replied so far. The responses have helped me to shift my perspective and view my experience more positively.",

I guess this is all caused by years of being in the engineering school and building the imposter syndrome, and having to be like that for all those job interviews. \n\nI also think ever since I started working from home I keep having the urge to log in to my work laptop again after work hours, I really don't feel \"done\" for the day if that makes sense. \n\nAnyone dealt with those issues before? And how did you overcome them? \n\nThanks !",

I've only been there for 2 months and a little before that they hired a new CEO. The new CEO is highly unpopular from what I gather and is a very old school \"ass in seats\" type of guy. I kept seeing emails about the new \"DC office\" and how they were targeting that area.\n\nThe listings for their jobs that were remote shrank significantly and they are all targeted towards Washington, DC now. I didn't think much of this until I started seeing engineer after engineer leave. 4 people from my small team left in a month along with other big time departures like the president of the company. It was very hush hush as to why  they departed and they all \"left on good terms\". \n\nSo then I see some Glassdoor reviews pop up, and they keep saying the same thing: the new CEO wants people to move and work out of DC and that's why people are leaving. Well, I live in Phoenix so there is no fucking way I'm going to move my entire family to DC out of the blue. \n\nMy manager hasn't said a thing about this to me, but I keep getting emails talking about DC and people leaving.

One of the teams has been approaching me about a role and said I'm ideal for it. I asked the level and it's the same as what I'm currently at, but inquired about it being a level hire. The VP (who isn't the hiring manager) said it can't go higher. I know that isn't true.

        "body": "Hello,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I have made some mistakes in my career, luckily I think they have been early enough is isn't to late to try and salvage the situation. I am curious to hear everyone's take on what is going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was working at a fairly large military contractor for last part of my schooling, and worked full time for a year (graduated in April). So started in Jan of last year and left in Feb. This job was great actually really enjoyed it, there was those days where I hated it but for the most part everyone was super collaborative, interesting work, modern stack, and not much to complain about. Then they started doing restructuring they ended up selling my team   to another company, got put on a new team, then that new team started getting dissolved, and I basically was unsure about my job and what was really going on. In addition to every thing that was going on after talking to other friends I realized I was getting pretty underpaid compared to market value for the area, I was getting paid 72k, and most places were 80-90.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now, I took a new job that is fully remote (it's local but they gave me the option to work remote), the job paying a lot better $110, which honestly probably is way to much, but hey they offered it.  However that is where this drama just barely starts. So this job has a TON of technical debt, more so then what they originally told me.  They have a backlog of almost a year plus worth of bugs, angular 8, and what not.  With this technical debt there are lot of bugs (I would say 70% of backlog items), many of which aren't even fixable with current stack, or super hard to trouble shoot.   \n\n\nAs we fix issues there is no current process to really test against production environment, and QA testers also are stuck with half testing it. So with that we fix things and it introduces other small things, or maybe it wasn't possibly fixed. Which is fine, but it is difficult cause all of these come back to look like its my fault.. Which our team is really small its me and one other guys (which doesn't do a ton). But lately I feel like everything has been a complete mess, and everyone is playing the blame game, and complaining stuff is not getting done fast enough. Which is the furthest from the truth. Which I think my manager would back me up, but I can tell hes starting to get frustrated with everything that is going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that I have started to document every single thing I'm working on, what I found, who I worked with, just if something was to hit the fan. But I  basically am worried that based off past stories I have heard one day I will just go in and they will let me go. (I guess they dont usually hire full time (as I am), looking at the company states 80% of work force is contracted employees) Which this was my worry all along because I know looking like a job hopper is not good. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are plenty of other stuff going on with the company, which honestly is just shady (they've been lying to 3rd parties, and I have to say stuff particular way or they get stuck paying more money). Just to list a few..  I'm worried if I'm let go it basically sets me up for a super bad looking resume and 100% a job hopper.... Feel like it's a touch situation to be in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAppreciate any insights/experiences you may have had.",

        "body": "Hi Redditors, I ran into the strangest situation this week and am looking for some thoughts and advice on what to do.\n\n**TL;DR:** As a contractor, I applied for an internal FTE position for the same role under my current manager that I was basically told I would for sure get. After my interviews and all positive feedback from them, recruiting won't move forward with my application. Could the recruiter have something against me or a vested interest to hire external candidates?\n\nDetails:\n\nI'm currently work as a contractor at a fairly large tech company via a consulting company. There's an opening for a full time position on my team for the same role that I'm working in now. (FYI, it's not SDE but similar.) I joined late last year and am doing well, so my manager (who's also the hiring manager for the position) recommended me to apply. Unfortunately, since it's a bigger company with a lot of rules, there's no simple conversion from contractor to FTE - I have to go through the full interview process. My manager basically told me this would just be a formality and my interviews would mostly be with people on our team whom I already work with.\n\nI finished all the interviews and got positive feedback during all of them. After a week, I asked my manager if there any updates and he said he hasn't heard from recruiting. So I reached out to recruiting asking when I can expect to hear and they said they're still debriefing other candidates and will get back to me when that's done.\n\nThe thing is, it's kind of strange but I was also asked to help out as interviewer for the same position that I am applying to since there are two FTE positions open for this role. Since I'm the only person doing this work right now on the team and whoever else we hire will be working closely with me, my manager wanted me to be an interviewer. So I interviewed a couple other candidates the same week I had my own interview. Recruiting held a debrief session with the interviewers - including me - and the candidates got the decisions within 3 days after their interviews. We didn't hire them. (Btw, I'm not involved as an interviewer anymore, because recruiting found out that I was a contractor and there is some rule that contractors can't be interviewers for FTE positions.)\n\nSo now it's been \\~2 weeks after my own interviews and I still haven't heard anything. I asked my manager about this again today. He said he's asked recruiting several times to move forward with setting up the debrief meeting for me, but that they \"seemed to be ignoring his requests.\" He told me that even though recruiting doesn't have a say in who gets hired, he is dependent on them to coordinate the process.\n\nI wonder why this recruiter assigned to me is refusing to move forward with my application? I haven't talked to them in person outside of a couple email exchanges, all very brief and polite from both sides. Even the initial \"recruiter screen\" and scheduling the interviews were done by other people. So I don't think they have anything against me personally, but perhaps they have a vested interest to hire the candidates that are sourced/introduced by them? Has anyone heard of this happening?\n\nWhat should I do in this situation?? Can this recruiter actually block me from being hired? At this rate, they will continue delaying my application while they continue bringing in new candidates. And I'll be forced to extend my contract after it ends next month (and obviously, not guaranteed that I can continue extending in the future) and miss out on this FTE opening.",

From my little experience, I feel like my team tends to create things without deep analysis or designing/architecting and without much consideration on what would potentially come up next. Just get things done first for customer, and deal with the rest later. For e.g. design a db in a way that it leverages the existing code as much as possible to get things done on time. Now a year later, it became a performance bottleneck, and the code is already coupled enough. It has grown a lot and become risky to make big changes. And fixing bugs/issues from it is becoming really stressful for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where my question started.

My only concern is that I owe a lot in student loans and I have credit card debt. My loans are around 180k and I had over 15k in credit card debt. I just paid 2/3 of the credit card debt off. The job is in software development/IT and salary is around 80k. I pay everything on time and have only 1 derogatory mark on my transunion report with a credit score of around 670. I don't think they can see my credit score anyhow.\n\nDo you guys and girls think this debt could get my offer rescinded?  Anyone find themselves in a similar situation?",

Today he indicated that I may receive an offer from the company, however the salary may not be exactly what I want so I'm hoping to get some advice from yous guys. \n\nI just graduated college with an Associate degree. I've already been working as a programmer for about a year now for $55k a year. The recruiter told me the salary range for the new job is $70k - $85k annually. This is in medium/high cost of living city in the Midwest.\n\nI'm familiar with ASP.NET Core, however this company uses the older ASP.NET Framework which I'm not familiar with. During the technical interview I really struggled due to this and I'm surprised they're wanting to move forward with me. I did promise to study ASP.NET in my free time to catch up, and I mean it. They also asked for a Bachelors degree and 3+ years experience, neither of which I have. \n\nI'm also concerned if working with such an outdated technology will have long term effects on my career, although currently I am working with WPF so that's only slightly better. \n\nThe recruiter said they're thinking $65k to $70k to offer me. Based on COL where they're located,  $65k wouldn't even be a raise. So if they do offer, I'm going to ask for $80k because I know that's in their range, does that seem reasonable?\n\nAs a follow up, I like the job I have now and would happily stay if they matched the salary.

With it being a government job, I've also heard it's kind of slow paced and boring but obviously there's various departments and the requirements were pretty new tech (which I've used and am comfortable with) so maybe that won't be the case.

        "body": "I'm the lead engineer on a small team at a non-tech company (I refer to my work as \"enterprise software development\"). It's just me and a few juniors. My boss is an architect, kind of. I'll also add that I'm a decent developer, but by no means am I \"FAANG-worthy\".\n\nI've really enjoyed my job up until recently. I've had agency to implement things however I want, and I took that opportunity to make sure we were doing everything in a forward-thinking and well thought-out way, even if that meant taking a few hours/days to try a few things out. By doing this, I learned a lot and even got to build some really neat solutions to problems we encountered while trying to build as smartly as possible.\n\nSome time ago, our CTO decided he wanted our company to be more tech-focused, and chose my boss's team to sort of spear-head this move. Since then, a lot of what we've been developing has been proofs of concept for different business-units, who are used to finding external vendors for technical needs. There was, understandably, considerable push-back to a lot of our work, because change isn't easy--it never is.\n\nThis sort of came to a head a few weeks ago when I was working on a 1-2 week PoC for some business unit (important information: we're a global company, so sometimes there's a language barrier when speaking with other business units). Throughout the development process I kept my boss informed. I told him what I understood the problem to be and how I planned to implement it. I then had him test it out and give me feedback so that I could make it really clean for the inevitable demo to the business unit who asked for it. He was on board... Until the day of the demo. We met (via zoom) to dry-run the demo and he told me, more or less, that in all of his conversations with the requesting business unit he'd never heard them complain about what my PoC aimed to solve, that he wasn't sure the product demo was going to go over well because of that. I was, I think understandably, upset. I asked him why he had approved of me working on this, why I hadn't gotten this feedback earlier, etc. and he just said \"I made a mistake\". Needless to say, the demo went poorly.\n\nThis is one instance, but we've been running into this similar issue (the poor demos, not the miscommunications) for a while and it's got me questioning my role at this company. Aside from this, I've been realizing lately that I have only been learning as much as I have because I chose to. There's not really anyone technical enough around me to give me feedback on my methods or talk through alternative options. Nobody would know if I built stuff in a shitty way, and that *feels* like a yellow, if not red, flag.\n\nThe relationship I have with my boss, which used to be very amicable and relatively close, has been strained by these turns of events, and the stress of work has started to bleed into my not-at-work life (I'm remote, so it's a figurative not-at-work).\n\nFinally, on Monday my boss told me I needed to let a few other folks (who I don't know and have never worked with) have access to our cloud-provider account (like, give them permission to create resources & all that). I asked him what sort of governance we were putting in place to make sure that nothing got out of hand, because it's my role to monitor our cloud-resources and when something's fishy, security comes after me, not him. He said, basically, that we can trust these folks, they're superior to me, etc. and that if security hassled me, I should just refer them to him instead. This feels messy and like it's just asking to be a pain in my neck long term.\n\nIs it time to start polishing my resume? Am I over-reacting? If I leave, it's just a bunch of juniors and an architect, and nobody really knows what we have other than myself (I keep our documentation available to everyone, but that doesn't mean they use it). The juniors would have no mentor and the architect hasn't written code in I don't know how long. I'm not, like, emotionally invested in the success of my employer, so leaving wouldn't really bother me, but I'm sort of at the point in my life where I'd like a \"career position\" so I wouldn't have to shop around for raises & whatnot every few years as is the norm in the tech world.

I'm currently going into my senior year at a top 10 university (top 10 overall, not necessarily for CS), and I'm studying CS and EE. After a few business/consulting-focused internships, I'm looking to go into tech as I feel it would be a waste not to apply my technical background, and I really am interested in the industry. I have some solid programming skills and projects (mostly from CS classes I've taken), so I think I would fair well as a SWE if I work hard enough, but I don't ever see myself being the \"best\" SWE, or even among the top 5-10% of developers. Thus, I am already planning on going into SWE for a few years, then transitioning into something else, like PM. \n\nI also know that PM roles are extremely hard to come by, and the best time to snag one would be right after graduation. I think I would enjoy a PM role and my skill set is more aligned for PM, but I am concerned about getting into a leadership-type role in tech straight out of college. Again, I will have a CS degree from a great school and have some decent programming experience, but I'm certainly not the best programmer around or someone who codes for fun in their free time. Thus, it seems like I would be out of place starting off as a PM right away and being tasked with leading a team of engineers who are much more skilled than me. \n\nI feel like if I start out in SWE and gain some legitimate technical experience, then I would be a far more effective leader and PM, but on the flip side, getting a role in PM after working in SWE is harder than getting one right out of college. Am I misconstruing what a PM really does or overestimating the technical ability required? I've always felt that my leadership style is most effective when I am as knowledgeable about a task as the people I am working with, but perhaps that is not how I should be looking at PM roles. If anyone has any advice on the decision between going into PM right after college vs transitioning into it after a few years of development experience, I would love to hear your thoughts. It's all really just a big bag of imposter syndrome, but I wouldn't want to start out in a career that I'm not yet suited for.",

I had around 100 application out at the time just shotgunning for an entry level job, and got 2 responses back both negative. Everyone dropped their summer programs, like half of my college friends were fired from their internships before the first day. For a few months I bounced between doing resume stuffer projects and sending out applications. I was approaching around 200 applications total when I finally got a response from some IT contract position at the local school system. This was really sub-optimal but at this point I was desperate and was willing to work anywhere as long as it was with a computer. It was a good temporary job but I was really dissatisfied with it since the work was repetitive and really easy, not to mention the poor pay. I started applying more on linked in near the end of the contract, and by some miracle an honest-to-goodness software role wanted an interview with me. The interview was almost devoid of technical questions, was obviously just a means for the contracting agency to steal someone's paycheck, and I was hired within 3 days. The pay was not great but is was enough to where I could pay rent and get by. Fast forward 5 months of working remotely doing interesting but underpaid work and developing my stack, some college buddies recommended I try messaging a recruiter for a growing fintech company in my area. About a month of pestering the recruiter finally got me a interview, and I passed with flying colors.

        "body": "Hey guys, I'm finding myself in a weird spot in my career, and struggling to figure out how to move forward.\n\nFor context, I graduated in 19, and I've been working at one company since graduating.\n\nI work for a consulting firm in the Midwest. I know it's not the most glamorous job, but the pay and benefits were competitive for the area and at the time location was really important to me.\n\nShortly after I started working, someone requested that I transfer into their department with the promises of being able to work on exciting technologies and expand my skill set, in addition to being 100% remote. This obviously appealed to me so I signed on.\n\nThe reality of it was that the team that was being put together failed to sign a single contract. So, I was assigned to a project in the meantime to ensure I was billing hours. That project was a small dumpster fire, and was entirely ETL and SQL work.\n\nAfter a few months it was obvious that the project was not advancing my career. I wasn't learning new languages, new skills, or improving the ones I already had. I was working with legacy \"code\", and the client was not interested in improvements or optimizations. They just wanted the product to work, and pay as little as possible to maintain it. There was no incentive for me to learn how to improve or optimize the work I was doing as a result, and I didn't have the budget to explore those things even if I wanted to. Something to consider is that because of the projects problems I got a ton of experience working directly with clients, managing and deciding on budgets, resolution times ,etc. I did a lot of the work of the PM in this role, as our PM took a backseat on a lot of this work. I consider this to be great experience, even though it was stressful at the time, but I'm not sure how to leverage it when searching for jobs.\n\nA few months ago, my boss left our department despite never fulfilling his promises on the kind of work I'd be a part of. I really feel like this has set me back in a huge way.\n\nRecently I was transferred away from that project onto another project that is entirely SQL work. This is despite the fact that I've been very vocal about my concerns as regarding my career development.\n\nI have a bachelor's in CS and an OCA certification for Java, but it's been nearly two years since I've written real code. What do I need to learn/do to start putting myself in a position that I will be a competitive candidate for a role where I'll get to do what I actually want to do?\n\nMy interest right now is in full stack development, but I'm open to anything that really requires me to think and optimize and improve my work. Problem solving is what I love about this field, so if anyone has any other suggestions I'm all ears.\n\nI love working with backend languages like python, java, and C++, but recently I've been trying my hand at Javascript and found that to be pretty enjoyable too.\n\nI did create a small website using one of the main frameworks years ago, that had a front end/back end that worked and was hosted by a hosting service, so I know I can do it. But it's been so long that I can't quite remember the steps I need to take \n\nI'm currently taking an online course on Javascript (udemy) to try to get a really deep understanding of the language before I try my hand at properly learning a framework. My HTML and CSS skills are terrible (right now, but I'm sure I can improve with some elbow grease).\n\nI am moving closer to a larger city (30 min drive) so hopefully my options for employers will greatly expand once I make the move.\n\nIf anyone has any advice at all, I'd love to hear it. For anyone who made it this far, thanks so so much for taking the time.\n\n\nTL:DR; How do I transition from a primarily SQL based role into literally anything else where I get to write real code.",

I have about 8 months of informal experience working with JavaScript/React, although I've been doing an internship for a month so far at a brand new start-up working on the MVP for a React chat app. Can I get a full-time (ideally tech) job with this kind of background? Any tips on how I can make that happen? I do have a mechanical engineering degree and some years of experience there, but yeah trying to switch to coding, which so far I like a lot better.\n\nFull background:\n\nI started learning JavaScript basics at the beginning of 2020 to get ready for a coding boot camp, but then the whole pandemic thing happened and I felt less inclined to do the boot camp's remote program. Fortunately, I had a close friend who's a Software Engineer and also had prior experience teaching at a boot camp, and he offered to teach me personally as my mentor. He put together his own curriculum tailored for me based on what he thought would be most beneficial, starting with some cs fundamentals, then more web fundamentals, and then finally putting together an actual web application with React. I spent a lot of time building it under his guidance, really making sure to have a polished final product for my portfolio and resume (you can check it out here if you like: [https://www.rolemate.io](https://www.rolemate.io/jobs))\n\nWith that experience, I was fortunately able to get a Software Engineering internship at a startup, where we're working on the very early stages of an app creating the MVP for a social app. It's been pretty good React experience as well as I've been working on new features with the guidance of the Senior Software Engineer.\n\nAnd of course, I've also been practicing with algorithms (my least favorite part) with an online course and just grinding away on different problems and mock interviews. This part is probably my weakest area and I'm still struggling to get solutions consistently.\n\nAnd that's pretty much where I'm at. I've been sending out a BUNCH of applications but haven't gotten a single response besides the internship. Is there any hope for me with my unconventional background?? I'd appreciate any feedback and insights!",

After a lot of begging and pleading we only recently got access to a proper DBMS (MSSQL). No standalone software or script can be created outside of the \"real\" IT/dev dept, but their turnaround time on such requests from other depts (like accounting) is abysmal (1-2 years). But the CFO was desperate and so managed to carve out the position I now have with a few other people.\n\nSo back to my original question - I'm aware that VBA is not a \"real\" language (real as in, used seriously for development by a tech company), but I also think it would be disingenuous to say that I haven't learned a lot from having to use it so much for work. Would you consider the 1.5 years I have doing this as relevant xp when applying for a SWE position, or no; and in either case, how would you describe it in an application (ie concise yet attractive)?\n\nEDIT: typos",

I don't really consider myself an extremely extrovert person, but whenever I don't meet someone for 24 hours my mood falls down significantly. I love talking to other people, getting to know other people, travelling, and in general I like to be on the move all the time. I just hate being in one place.

I've been taking CE courses for a bit over a year now with the goal of getting a software engineering certification from the university I'm attending.\n\nEverything I've learned so far in the 3-4 classes I've taken has been restricted to a single coding language. I've chosen Python. I've come a long way and it's been a challenge getting as far as I have. I'm confident in my Python skills and know that I can program pretty much anything the language allows me to if I can do a bit of research. \n\nBut then I go to look for requirements for entry-level software engineers. And programming in a single language is 1/10th of the requirements they're looking for. Most want you to be familiar with full-stack design. Comfortable in multiple languages. Familiar with both scripting and compiled languages. Proficient in databases. Networking. Familiar with a bunch of third-party tools that I've never heard of like WireShark or SoapUI.\n\nIt's so incredibly demotivating. It feels like I spent the last year and a half checking off ONE of TEN boxes that employers want in an entry-level employee. Is this normal? Should I be approaching it a different way?

I really like C# and .NET and have several webapps out there that I designed, built and deployed by myself(Including one that makes me a little $$!). I have a decent resume and would consider myself to be a proficient programmer who has enough full stack projects out there to let a potential employer know I'm a good candidate.\n\nI'll skip the pity stories because no one gives a shit, but I didn't have it easy growing up and often turned to trolling and being a piece of shit online for entertainment when I was a teen, it was the best form of attention I could get at the time. I used to bait people on reddit, twitter, and other social medias and say some dumbass shit, I loved the thrill of seeing just how many angry replies I could get and how angry people would get at me. This all took place when I was ages 15-18. \n\nI made the foolish mistake of trusting a good IRL friend of mine with this knowledge of my shit past and about 3 years ago we had a falling out and he doxxed me hard on social media. The logs and things that he posted weren't the most obscene things on this earth, but it did paint me as a very shitty, racist, ignorant person, even though I know for a fact that I never truly believed those things and was just memeing and trolling like an idiot.\n\nI could write for hours about all the things I lost because of it, but I don't want to bore everyone. I lost some old friends and my girlfriend had to disassociate herself with me for good, that one stung the most and still does to this moment.\n\nFast-forward to 3 years later, I've lost a lot of weight, been to therapy and can confidently say that I'm no longer that type of person at all, inside and out. I look back at those years with disgust. The original \"doxxing\" thread is now deleted. The comments on the thread are still there, and when you google my name, one of these comments comes up. It isn't a good look, but it's a lot better than before. I've tried many ways to see if the original doxx thread is archived anywhere but as far as I can tell it isn't (It definitely is somewhere out there, but it looks like it isn't traceable/ easily found)\n\nSo, as I begin to look for a start to my career, I wonder if it's even worth it to press forward, knowing that inevitably someone from HR or a team member or recruiter is gonna google my name and see those two comments labeling me as a piece of shit, It's only a comment or two, so there is a ton of plausible deniability with there being no concrete logs linking to my name. I can't have any social media anymore, as it would most likely just get harassed and to be honest I have no desire to maintain a social media presence at all, is this going to be a problem for your average company? Should I just own up to everything if ever asked? \n\nI'm sorry for writing this cringe, pathetic thread, and I'm sure that many reading this will say that I don't deserve to have a career of any sorts, and I can understand your position if this is the case. This is something that has consumed my life for several years now and has drove me to the brink of suicide and back several times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks",

The few personal projects that I have is a discord bot, a barebones path algorithm visualizer website, and a few web scraping applications for stocks and covid information. I didn't start applying to jobs till after I graduated (which is a mistake for sure) and I applied throughout the summer using LinkedIn and Indeed.

I got demotivated from the job hunt in september and was getting anxiety from not hearing back from companies and family members lecturing every other day about not finding oppurtunities. The pandemic also made me demotivated from starting new projects and doing leetcode problems without getting even a phone call from companies made me demoralized. I started only applying to jobs every now and then. Fast forward to now, in the past month I started some online courses on udemy, cs50 from harvard, and freecodecamp to learn more about web dev.

Won\u2019t get much experience with infra at scale. \n\n- Salary is $130k. Similar benefits to my current role. \n\nNot sure why but my gut feeling is leaning towards skipping this new job. Only plus is the money. This is a lateral move. I have 15 years experience in the field and don\u2019t have a problem finding other jobs. I feel like this new job won\u2019t really give me the experience I\u2019m looking for in terms of working with infrastructure architecture at scale. But I kinda want the money. I have already asked for a raise at my current job and got a double digit raise, so I\u2019m not sure if they will counter this offer. If I bring up the offer, they may not counter and I might have to just leave. \n\nUnsure why I\u2019m hesitant to leave. Partly because I\u2019m pretty comfortable and am just chasing money.

I don't know - there have been studies that say people aren't even really productive for more than like 20-30 hours a week anyways.

This can take anywhere from days to weeks and they need to remote access my laptop to do the installation.\n\nThese delays compound with other issues (and my own mistakes) to bring me to today.

We went through HTML/CSS, SQL, Javascript, Python and C#/.NET in that order, with a heavy emphasis on .NET (and a little on .NET Core).  \"Learn at your own pace\" meant that we would be enrolling on online courses from places like Pluralsight and doing some skill checks and short coursework developed by their staff... of Jr Devs that ended up working there after they couldn't find a job in the field of their choice (this is confirmed by them to me, not speculation).\n\nWhat's that, you say?  You paid over 10 grand to enroll in online courses and take some coursework developed by people who have zero industry experience?  That's correct.  At this point I want to briefly stop and note that not all camps are like this, I think I maybe just picked the worst of the bunch.  Please don't be like me, ask questions before you enroll like \"who developed your coursework?\" and \"What kind of real-world experience does your staff have?\".\n\nOk, so that kind of sucked, but at least I was going to get help finding a job when this was all over... right?  Not so much.  Our job placement guy was a total disappointment.  While he helped us write our resumes (they all looked the same... more on that later) and did mock interviews, the actual job placement part of his job left a lot to be desired.  He never actually looked for any jobs for me or my peers, instead opting to send us links to meetups around town, which if you have been to them, aren't exactly job fairs (although the networking can be beneficial).\n\nWhen I actually did get some interviews (on my own, no thanks to my job-placement guy) I quickly learned that most companies do not want to hire folks like me with zero experience in the industry.  It is important to note that I went all-in on .NET, and was trying to get a job as a full-stack developer working with OOP (lol, I didn't even learn what an API was at the time as it was never taught to me or brought up in my coursework).  In one interview that I was able to secure, the interviewer asked me about my resume, specifically where/how it was written.  I let him know that it was written with the help of my camp's job placement guy and he flat-out told me that he had received roughly 25 applications from my peers and our resumes were exactly identical.  No idea why I got an interview and others didn't, maybe he was just curious.  I didn't get the job.\n\nIn the post title I also mentioned not to trust sites that promote \"hey go to this bootcamp!\" or \"here is a great story from Unclematttt about his experience with going from zero to hero!\".  This bit is what actually made me want to make this post.\n\nThere is a LinkedIn power-user (again, not going to disclose their name) who reached out to me and was chatting me up about his cool site that helped people just like me choose their bootcamp.  \"Hey Unclematttt, I see you went to XYZ Bootcamp- would you mind writing a review for my site and maybe doing a AMA for our users?\"  I proceeded to tell him my experience was bad, I am pretty sure the camps lie about placement numbers (at least half of my 'graduating' class never even made it into the tech industry), and the job I ultimately got was more of a support role that was at my wife's work.  I actually had to grind my way up to this position by working double-time and developing helpful scripts and applications in my free time.\n\nThe power-user's response?  Silence.  I followed up a couple of days later to ask what their thoughts were, and they never responded.  I guess it didn't really fit the narrative that they were trying to push.\n\nNow that I have shared my experience, I want to note a few things:\n\n* There *are* quality bootcamps out there, I just ended up at one of the shitty ones (do your research)\n* The job situation in my city (known as somewhat of a tech-hub in the region) might not be the same as your city\n* I could have done more to build out my portfolio before applying to jobs and possibly giving a bad first-impression (don't be like me)\n\nHere are some tips that I can share that I think might be helpful if you are just getting into the idea of picking out a school/bootcamp and want to be successful:\n\n* I sound like a broken record here, but DO YOUR RESEARCH on your bootcamp.  Don't put blind trust into what they are *selling* you.  They churn through students and their goal is to just get your money and get you into their program\n* If you are interested in full-stack development, take baby steps and learn everything you can about backend engineering first (what is/how to build an API, how do applications interact with databases, what are the hot SQL and NoSQL technologies in your area to learn, what are containers and how do they work, etc.).  Full-stack devs do not just sprout out of the ground IME, it can take years to become proficient with any given stack\n* What stacks are hot right now?  Are there lots of jobs for ELK?  What about MEAN?  Find something that you like and go nuts on it\n* Personalize your resume.  Start with what your camp/school helps you build, then do something (anything!) to make it different than your peers\n* IME there was more success with Javascript devs from my camp than anyone else.  Consider learning Javascript in detail and some of the more popular frameworks like ~~AngularJS~~ and Vue (I have been informed that Angular isn't hot anymore- I am not a JS dev, so my apologies on that, research what frameworks are popular in your area.  Edit: this is debated below in the comments, so again do research on what Frameworks are popular in your area.)\n* You will likely end up using databases in some way shape or form during your career, make sure you understand the ins-and-outs of various database technologies and how it applies to your stack/languages of choice\n* Develop a solid portfolio.  If you are doing front-end work, this is a lot easier as people like \"pretty pictures\" (my opinion).  Make daily commits on Github (many employers will ask for your Github profile to check it out before deciding to interview you).  Also have a basic-to-awesome portfolio website, and even though we all hate it, get a LinkedIn account.  Consider buying the premium version if you have the cash for it.\n* Try to find a language/stack that you are comfortable with and enjoy and go HARD on it.  Make sure before you make this decision that there are plenty of jobs that want those skills, there is fierce competition for Jr Dev roles, so you will need to apply to many of them (maybe even hundreds) before you land your first gig.\n* Make sure you are in a good place mentally before starting on this journey.  It can be soul-crushing at times, but there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel if you persevere\n\nI could write a whole lot more, but I think that this covers most of it.  Sorry for the long post, this is kind of therapeutic to write out.  Believe in yourself, but also take care of your future self by not making some of the mistakes I did along the way.  If I could do it, anyone can with the right amount of drive.\n\nTL;DR Make sure your bootcamp doesn't suck before enrolling.  Know the local market and what skills are sought-after.  Don't trust sites that paint a pretty picture, this whole process is a total grind.  Believe in yourself and put in the work.\n\nedit: Minor grammar fix.

In my experience companies act as if they own you.\n\nI've been offered a new job with a globally renowned company in the UK and have been presented with a contract that intends to own all my IP/code. I've been on sabbatical and developed a lot of projects that are in full production.\n\nNaturally asked for a waiver for said pre-existing projects. The company is not interested in engaging in this process at all. Stated that if they were relevant to my role/the employer, then the IP would reside with them.\n\nWhy do companies act like they own programmers? Why should all my ideas belong to the employer? Why shouldn't I be allowed to continue with my pre-existing projects on my own dime/time?! Sure, anything I do concerning their business is 100% theirs. But to not even want to engage in discussion of side projects is just ridiculous. Especially given that the hiring manager loved the fact I had side projects during interviews?!\n\nHonestly, as a creative individual, I am thinking about leaving software and becoming a plumber. Pay outside London is poor, and what's the point in developing all these skills if I can't use them to benefit my life? I feel so trapped in this career. Am I the only one that feels this way? How do the rest of you deal with these issues? Do you refuse to sign? Or ignore such contracts and go ahead anyway?\n\nUPDATE: UK contracts often state that the company owns everything developed \"in the course of your employment\" (which is exactly the problem with the current contract that I've been presented with). This clause sounds very innocent. But it's not. See \\[1\\]. Note that using your own equipment in your own time does not save you! \n\nFrom \\[1\\]:\n\n>If material which includes IP rights is created outside office hours and/or using the employee\u2019s private resources this may give rise to arguments that the rights belong to the employee rather than their employer, but that is not decisive. The fact that work is done outside normal working hours does not necessarily mean that the work is not done in the course of employment as, for many employees, there is often no clear demarcation of the hours of work.  \n>  \n>The key question to be asked is whether the work was the kind of work which the employee was employed to do i.e. whether it was within the scope of their employment. Could the employee have been ordered to do the work and would it have been a breach of contract for the employee to not do it? The terms of any contract of employment and job description will be relevant, however, these (and duties more generally) often evolve in the course of time and it may therefore not be appropriate to rely on them exclusively.\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] Russell-Cooke associate Emily MacDonald looks at intellectual property rights within the context of the employment contract (2020).

I recently got an email from a recruiter (for now I'll keep the recruitment company name hidden) that said they had a specific company with a specific job listing that was sent to me after I asked for more information and it seems like it all lines up... However, this is just where I wanted to see if these are big enough red flags to be wary of. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. emailed me on my work email, had to ask at second email to contact me elsewhere\n2. the recruitment company has a legit website and linked in and the website graphically is very clean. It only has a contact portion of it though with the CEO's phone number. It seems to be new and I don't know if this is something that happens with any sort of scam. i.e., sometimes in certain areas people make 'companies' over and over on platforms until their scam is caught but again just repeat that process and present themselves as a 'new' company. \n3. The insistence on that this is for a company that is looking to have the turnaround process of the interview in a very short time. It seems it is like the process feels perfect in regards to minimal interview(s).\n4. pay is extremely good. Base is 2x what I make + bonus + shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings which are literally holding me to not think I am being crazy are:\n\n1. recruiter is legit on linked in it seems.\n2. job is for a company within nasdaq (can't find the posting elsewhere online but that is a given.\n3. didn't seem like a mass generated email, it was very identifiable that they were talking to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I being crazy? The work email thing just put this whole thing into a very bad place for me as I have zero idea how they got it. (No linked in connection with it, no usage elsewhere online besides internally at company, however I work at a pretty damn known company so it might not be too crazy to somehow find my email somewhere)",

I have a 3.9 GPA from a top 50 CS school and have prepped well but it seems like CS was just a huge waste of time.\n\nI go on LinkedIN and see all of these \"software engineers\" at these top companies and all I see is that they studied at top 10 schools studied a major completely abstract something like Industrial Engineer, Physics, Biology, even seen Art, and I'm assuming that they could not find jobs in their majors so they instead go into the software engineer route. They suddenly go from being a Masters + PhD in biology to a software engineer at FAANG within a year and in a way it frustrates me to know that these wealthy candidates only got into these top companies because they can afford to buy the resources, all the coursera courses they want, pay for a bootcamp, or CS MS, it's truthfully unfair.\n\nI know I shouldn't judge but I truly am passionate about CS and to see wealthy candidates with no passion for CS (otherwise why wouldn't it be their undergrad?) switching to Software Engineering at FAANG companies immediately within a year through different means (e.g. references, family, wealth, buying resources, etc) and get in without having to even study CS is simply unfair.\n\nHow do you guys feel about this?

I figure I should lay out all the gory details so I can get the best advice possible.\n\nThree years ago, I was laid off from my last job, where I worked for a little over two years as a data engineer. Prior to that, I worked as a technical consultant for two years at one of the big software giants (name omitted for privacy reasons). Subsequent to my layoff, my then-husband and I moved to my current city so I could begin a master's degree program. We had a nasty divorce as I embarked on my studies, which were going reasonably well until everything went remote. Coupled with my depression (which is being treated), the stress of the divorce and online classes forced me into a leave of absence from my graduate program, to which I may decide not to return in favor of finding a full-time job.\n\nThis is where I need some help. It's been a long time since I appeared for a technical interview, though I do have experience conducting such interviews from my last job. I have several books I am using as preparation materials (Algorithms Illuminated by Roughgarden, Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, et al, CTCI, and EPI) and I am also trying my hand at some of the practice interview problems on CodeSignal. I have always struggled with these types of questions despite my four-year degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, and I am finding the preparation process rather overwhelming. Furthermore, I am worried about the large gap in my resume. I suppose my explanation is reasonable, but how can I convince prospective employers to take a chance on me?\n\nI feel very alone in this process, and it feels like the odds are stacked against me. Would I be better off just returning to my graduate program (my leave lasts until January)? How can I overcome this gap in my work history? I would also appreciate suggestions on effective strategies and helpful resources for brushing up on my skills and becoming more confident with technical questions.\n\nDMs are welcome.",

It's hard to say, \"We can handle all your FW/HW needs\" when you don't have anyone to do it.\n\nVariable pay -\n\nCurrently I have a 20% Bonus target, of which I've never seen more than 2.6%, although I only worked through one Bonus cycle (COVID). I also have ESPP which has a minimum payout and due to COVID had banner returns, all in this could potentially makeup \\~$40k but expected to settle around \\~$15-20k as the world returns to normal.\n\nStartup has equity, if things go well this could return, but it is a hardware/services company. Historically, aside from Roku, we're not hearing that many Cinderella stories. Maybe see a 2x on the strike.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day, I want to work on cool stuff.

I've been here for 1 year, and I'm actually finding my work very engaging, but there are just some issues I've noticed in this job for the past few months that make me feel like I can't work here anymore.\n\nThis discussion is not intended to be offensive, but I don't really know of a \"good\" way to describe my predicament.\n\nAlthough our site is based in the US, 80% of our employees are on visa from a certain southeast Asian country. Some of my American coworkers who were on track for promotion and exceeding expectations under American-born managment were suddenly let go when management randomly got rearranged recently to be a supermajority of people from said country. They were all terminated  within two weeks of the permutation for \"exceptionally poor performance\", and never were they asked to improve/put on PIP. No one who was from this southeast Asian country was let go, even though I'm aware of a few people who are certainly not pulling their own weight. (for example, there's a girl who's been here two years who's still under the trainee permissions group only)\n\nI'm currently under the last remaining American manager, but I'm receiving hints it's only a matter of time before I get moved to one of the other managers, and it's creating a silent sense of hostility that I'm not welcome here because I'm not \"one of them\". I'm not currently on PIP, but I think I only have about 3-4 months left here. I need some time to decompress, not worry about meeting my metrics, and start applying for new jobs, but I don't know how to do that. If I take PTO for a few days to do so, my metrics will fall. We're told that'll be taken into account in our 1-on-1 meetings if our performance suffers, but I feel like it'll just be turned around on me, saying I should be performing well enough that taking PTO shouldn't cause me to fail to meet my monthly goals.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n* Is my only option to just try the PTO route and hope management doesn't try singling me out for it?\n* With about one YOE, am I likely to be able to get out of here in 3-4 months, or do I need to take something else temporarily in the meantime, and try again later? Would that hurt my prospects to quit ***this*** job, go do something irrelevant for a few months, and apply to relevant jobs again afterwards?",

I passed the tech interview, and final interview with a member of their exec team. They seem like a good company overall. I got an offer, I didn't say I accept but will consider and passed all the criminal background checks, reference checks, within 2 days since this was through a recruiter. I hadn't heard the terms of the offer yet and hadn't signed anything or even the terms of the offer.\n\nCompany B came around nearly the next day as my first interview with Company A  and I really progressed to the point I got a written offer and employee agreement from them before Company A did. Company B is a really good work environment from the reviews and others I've talked to who had worked there, and I also use their site regularly. Also an added bonus, they paid $10k higher than what I asked. I'm considering this one since I've gotten so much more information upfront.\n\nI got the call that I got the offer from both companies within 12 hours of each other. Company A at 4:30pm on a Thursday and Company B at 9am sharp on Friday, which happened to be only an hour before an intro interview with a completely different company, which I attended but passed on doing a technical interview.\n\nWhile Company A does a background/criminal check this week, Company B has come back just 3 days later than expected with their offer in writing. Even though I've never signed anything and that I said I will need to consider and read through their offer, it sounds like their recruiter for Company A was under the impression that I had accepted the offer, despite not signing anything.

        "body": "To give some context:\n\nI've been with this company and my group; I'll call this burger group; for about 3 years now. According to my peers and management I have excelled in all expectations of my work both in development and technical understanding of our entire product. To the point where I was offered a retention bonus for 2 years for some big bucks.\n\nHowever most of the work I have been doing is outside of my job description, and to best summarize it, I apply band-aids to production issues, which management loved because it made our customers happy. However it was a very unpleasant experience for me because this band-aiding continued for over 1 year and I became frustrated with my work, because I was doing less development and was missing out on cool projects our team was working on, because I was quite literally turning the gears of the business to keep it moving... \n\nI was complicit because I knew I was helping the business and I kept getting promised for months that  they would get me off this work. Eventually they hired some additional resources to offload this work, with the expectation that I would be able to focus on more development... 6 months had passed and I was still doing the same thing... At some level I was still the expert of the things they needed so they still leaned on me heavily...\n\nBecause of this I felt like I wasn't growing enough in my role. I wasn't learning any new technologies. I wasn't developing any new software. I was in stagnant waters... I actually hated this the most. I just wanted to develop and build my technical skills considering I've only been in the industry for \\~4 years (3 of which at this company) I don't feel like I'm at the level where I should be in my technical skills. \n\nAnyways... A co-worker from a different org; I'll call this Pizza Group; reached out to me with a position on their team. This position had all the bells and whistles I could think of. It was R&D in some pretty bleeding edge tech and they were well funded by the group so they bought lots of equipment to play around with for R&D. All in all, it pretty much sounded like a candy shop in comparison to my current position. I would be working on a range of projects/Proof of Concepts, where I have complete freedom in how these projects are built and I'd be using some really cool tech that somewhat aligns with my hobbies and outside of work interests. Needless to say I did apply and was ready to get extended the offer after interviewing with their team. All while burger team was in the dark...\n\nAt this moment I decided to tell my managers at burger group about this opportunity I'm pursuing (before getting extended the offer from pizza group). They panicked and scrambled to talk to the managers of the pizza group and to talk to HR about my internal application. Before the meeting with HR (which was only a few days after I had informed my managers) I had several calls with both of the groups managers. Both seemed to care about what I wanted (What I wanted was to grow my technical skills and get better mentorship to do so, specifically working on cloud applications and microservices and scalability of such things). Both sides made some statements in an effort to convince me to pick them. Burger group offered me the opportunity to work in a different team within burger group that is focusing more on the development side of the things and the things I want to build my technical skills around. The pizza group already had a really exciting opportunity for me to begin with, not to mention it would come with a swanky new title that would make a lot of people jealous given my experience. Pizza group's opportunity comes with a pay raise as well 1 band up and this would go into effect as soon as I join the team. Burger group is prepared to offer me a pay raise 1 band up but wont go into effect until my retention bonus is over.... Ohhh shit... My retention bonus...\n\nThis is where it got really frustrating for me... My retention bonus hadn't expired yet, at least not for a couple months. So pizza group was informed about this late in the process and it definitely threw a wrench in my application, but they were willing to fight for me to make sure I don't have to pay my retention back. Burger group already knew that it would be pretty difficult for me to leave without me having to pay back my full retention. But it wasn't impossible...\n\nAt the end of the day, I ended up going with burger group because I am familiar with the projects and the team and I'd be building my technical skills in areas that would make me more marketable for my next opportunity. \n\nIt's been about 3 weeks since I made the decision and I am just starting the transition to the new team within Burger group, although I am still doing some of the old band-aiding I was doing... But it's more progress than they've ever shown. I only worry that because I am still in burger group, albeit on a different team, they will still reach out to me when they need their expert to slap some more band-aids on the product.\n\nBut every day I can't seem to feel anything but regret for the decision I made... It just seemed like such a fun opportunity, but pizza group weren't as skilled in cloud technologies, so I would have been learning along side them without the mentorship of someone with expertise in cloud or microservices. However these were still people with decades of experience in the industry, so I would have still had some level of mentorship.\n\nA few things I have reflected on:\n\n* I suck at making decisions at the pace they wanted.\n   * I like to think about career decisions for longer than 2 days... but maybe this is just me...\n* I hope burger group follows through on their promise, otherwise it was all for nothing...\n* I made myself look like a flake to Pizza team and feel like some connections were definitely damaged in the process, but they can be repaired with some effort\n* There's too much office drama and I don't know who to believe, but I kept hearing the same thing from multiple people so there must be some truth to those claims...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat would you have done? Did I make the right decision?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I've been in contact with the co-worker from pizza group that brought the opportunity to my attention. They and some other co-workers I've worked with, were all surprised with my decision (but not disappointed or upset with me), making me think I made the wrong one... They feel like there may still be a chance for me to talk to the managers of pizza group if I still wanted to join them because they are still looking for someone... However they may be moving past looking internally and are probably gonna look at external applicants... I also have 3 months left on my retention... IDK why I'm so conflicted...*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR;\n\nI was in a rut of patching production issues and not developing anything of substance both in my job and in my skills. An exciting opportunity came up but out of wanting to build my technical skills and have better mentorship I chose to stay with my current group with the exception that I will move to a different team within the group that focuses more on development.",

Here's my situation:\n\n\n- background/backstory (feel free to skip)\nI'm in my early thirties, have worked almost a decade in tech consulting (implementing/configuring SQL-based tools for things like sales management and accounting). In that time I worked mostly as an individual contributor, with a few years as lead consultant for some bigger projects (switched back to single contributor after a mini-burn out and deciding that being in meetings/writing email all day wasn't for me).\n\nI studied computer science in college back in Europe (about a decade ago) and am currently living and working in Toronto, Canada in consulting for a large organization (I actually quite like the company, I started here about 2 years ago, they have decent benefits/pay, though lately things have been changing slightly for the worse I find).\n\n- challenge/goal:\nI would want to switch to software development, my degree focused on this moreso, but due to circumstances and emigrating I kind of ended up in consulting. I'm finding it particularly challenging to find time/motivation to do side projects and coding after a full day at work (and I probably have some covid fatigue I think, measures downtown toronto have long been quite strict). In terms of prior coding experience: I got a Java certification a few years back and I have played around with  variety of language (Python, Java, C#, Cobol, Javascript etc.), but I find I'm lacking in recent and real world experience (as well as some of the supporting tools and technologies, things like Kubernetes or getting fully up to speed with AWS/Azure and microservice architecture).\n\nI've spent the last few years thinking about making the switch, but have always come up lacking on the execution and I REALLY want to change that. However, I also know that doing this as a side project after work every day is quite likely to fail. For this reason I was thinking of enrolling in one of the coding bootcamps available here, they're quite pricey but I think it might be the fastest/surest way for me to get into a dev role sooner rather than later, which will ultimately help with me develop the required skills further (I like/enjoy studying and learning as part of a job and think I'm quite good at it). My question is what would you do in my situation? Any specific suggestions/ideas or any glaring oversights/flaws that you see with my approach? Also: any experience (attending or hiring from) any of the specific coding bootcamps in Toronto is also most welcome!\n\nThanks all,\n\nR",

I've been programming since I was 18 but I finally decided to become a software developer at 24. I've gone through Unity (C#) and Flash (ActionScript 3) for videogames, and also C, Java, Smalltalk for the basics at uni, then Matlab and other misc languages for misc subjects.\n\nI got my first dev job as a Salesforce Dev at the start of 2020. I'm not a complete beginner, but I still feel that I'm behind regarding experience. My other friends are working on other languages and technologies (JS, React, Python, Node, you name it), and when I listen to what talk about it makes me feel that Apex is just a bubble that won't teach me much about the software development world. I want to learn more are get bigger challenges. But Salesforce is not providing that for me right now, and I don't know if that is because my current company sucks or because Salesforce is lacking things to teach me.\n\nMy goal these first years is to acquire as much experience and focus on expanding my knowledge. I don't care about the money or the job position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now I'm being offered two new positions: \n\n1) SSr. Salesforce Dev for a really good medium-sized company that is one of the best in the country. The talk with the dev leader was great and he sure knew a lot about Salesforce. He put emphasis on that they follow good practices and develop high quality code. I'll be working side by side with this person and I feel that I can learn a lot from him.\n\n2) Jr. Dev at an international company (offering Java, Python, and JS-related jobs mainly) that is growing a lot these last years and offers an HR product to the biggest companies in the world. The coding tasks they gave me to complete were the toughest I've ever been given for a job application. The interview with the leader was also great. He reviewed my code and did excellent corrections. It also made me remember that I've been out of touch with the most common practices in OOP. I have very good references for this company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now I don't know what to do. I do want to move to other techs, but that can be done whenever I want and I don't want to lose a good opportunity.\n\nShould I push a little bit further with Salesforce? Does Salesforce have much more to teach me?\n\nOr should I make the change now that I have the chance?",

Also , I'd say a majority of the .Net jobs these days are 50/50 .Net/Angular/React and Azure based DevOps .. There are a lot of demands for low pay and many employers tell me how saturated they are with qualified applicants for these low pay/high demand jobs. I know .Net is considered romantically appealing and so many want to learn it. It is what drove me to learn it in 2002. Although I was a VB6/ MFC programmer prior to it so got into .Net before it became as well known as today. However, I am starting to think this may not a good trait about .Net.. It has this romantic appeal and corporations that use it have unrealistic views about the framework and expectations of those who use it.\n\nDespite Java, for example, being an even larger framework, I have found many jobs in Java are much more focused on specific development needs and realistic demands. Rarely do I see a Java Spring job description that wants you also to be senior DevOps dev, like I do with many .Net jobs. Good luck ever finding a purely back-end .Net developer job, they are basically non-existent.\n\nI am interested in a framework/language that would be more lightweight, allow for more back-end focused development where I could become more specialized in one area of development.\u00a0 E.g. I hear a lot of DevOps people will do back-end dev with Golang and/or Python which is focused on helping to build and manage microservices.\u00a0 Having to spend a lot of time with React on top of that is pretty rough, but that is what I am seeing in many .Net jobs.  I feel if i am stuck working a full-stack type of job, I might as well just migrate towards Node and have a full-stack JS framework, rather than having to deal with complexities of two large frameworks.. Also, the demand for Azure DevOps is tough , since my background is mostly AWS and I would prefer a role that is more focus on one discipline (web dev vs DevOps) than having to be full-stack web dev/DevOps dev.",

I have also studied fundamental CS and programming subjects (such as the fundamentals in topics like OS's, Networking, Game Development, Hardware Design, etc.), learned the basics of other languages (C, C#, and Python), and built small things using them, for example, I worked on Linux for more than a year, tackled building a small game in C and did it, worked on small desktop apps using C# and .NET to be familiar with an actual OOP language and a different platform, got introduced to XML, and it gave me a solid ground to work with SVG in a web app I have been working on lately, I also worked on a small Flask project with a friend and helped them debug it and get it live. Note that I've tried to tinker around with all of this just because I want to be a programmer before being a Web developer, which is very important to me.\n\nBack to the Web, I've only been building personal projects, using Node.js for their back ends, along with vanilla JS on the front end. Although I see myself more fit to be a back-end developer, I don't think I know enough to title myself as a specialized \"back-end developer\" yet. I also haven't worked with any specific framework or tool on the front end and I'm not a designer, so I am not sure of that as well. However, I can implement complete designs using HTML and CSS. I have practiced this trying to remake templates I find on the internet by myself and finishing most of them, but I can't actually come up with design ideas myself.\n\nI know I'm ready and capable to get a job once I'm done with this year of service, but the problem is, I don't know what I can call myself or where I specialize in the Web. I'm sure I can build things, I can tackle any problems in a web app, learn the specific tools needed to solve them. I've been through these steps several times and I've completed the apps, but I don't know if this is enough for employers. I see a lot of jobs with specific titles such as \"React developer, Angular developer, etc.\" and I don't know. I'm currently building my portfolio, and I don't know what the title should be. Should I go with a \"Web developer\" or is it \"too general\"? Should I go with \"JavaScript developer\"? Or would it be thought of as me just open to using JavaScript? Thanks for reading through and I would really appreciate any advice!",

To be honest, my first few months here haven't been that great at all, but I'm burnt out on the job hunting thing and I want to get at least a year under my belt before I leave so it looks OK on the resume. For added context, the company has had a massive amount of voluntary turnover and the company basically has no culture at all.

I worked with her to get some small projects on there to fill it out, but they're nothing impressive. I've been trying to encourage her to work on more in depth projects so she could have more stuff to put on her resume and actually gain some coding/ debugging experience as well, but that doesn't really seem to be an option for her.

        "body": "I've been working for this company for 2 years now. I was originally employed  to work remotely as they were a startup with a grand total of 1 other developer.\n\nAs the team grew, they got an office in a shared space (hated it, 1 hour commute there, 1 hour back) and I went there every day for about 3 months(?). Then Covid happened and back to remote I go.\n\nThey announced the return to office, a different office this time though. This one is closer (40 minutes by foot/bus). We are up to 8 employees now (not including the CEO/CFO), two of them work in **England**. Literally hundreds of miles away.\n\nI honestly can't fathom why they are saying I need to be in the office. I told him straight up (I have always been up front and honest, if not a bit blunt) that I can not afford the \u00a3120 in doggy day care per month.\n\nThe response was \"That's not my problem, these are the things you have to think about before getting pets\". I did think of them, I've been working and delivering projects on time remotely for 2/3rds of my employment here, why the fuck do I need to be in an office?!\n\nThis is a company that I've been putting in 100% into for the past 2 years, working extra hours, going the extra mile. My dog won't be a puppy forever (how the hell can people even afford to have kids?!), but with the tone I doubt a compromise will even be considered.\n\nI've even been rejected a pay rise this year, I am currently sitting on \u00a330k per year, about \u00a34k less than competing jobs and my peers of similar experience.\n\nOur office is in an industrial block. In the winter it's cold as shit, in the summer it's hot as shit, the bathrooms are awful, there is no where to really eat because the breakroom is tiny  and there is a fucking gym next door that blares awful 100bpm dance music all day and slams weights. It also costs me \u00a35 to get here. So in total, this move back to the office is going to cost me \u00a3140 more per month.\n\nI am fucking pissed and now have to go through the hassle of dealing with this confrontation next week and I honestly can't be arsed.\n\nI've always read here that \"*don't be loyal and give them everything, because they will take it al*l\" but felt it was different here, but it's not. It's the same.\n\nI'll never work outside of my hours again and I won't touch a single thing outside of my department.\n\nNot my problem\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes it's a rant, I need to get it out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I know this got an overall negative response, but I thought an update would be in order anyway.\n\nFirst off, thanks to the person(s) who recommended I read over my contract. It actually states that I am indeed fully remote with the possibility of going into the office *one per month* for a company meeting.\n\nI would also like to point out, like another Redditor here has. I am in the UK, we have rights and contracts when it comes to work. They can't just *change their mind* whenever they like. So I have a right to be upset, I put in the time and thought into getting a breed of dog that fits around my working hours and got him as a puppy **because** working remote was what was agreed at my time of employment.\n\nAlso to all the people that say \"dog doesn't need daycare\" or \"just leave them at home and get someone to pop in to take them for a walk\". Yeah guys, it's a puppy. They can't just be left alone for 7 hours a day with zero stimulation. There is a perfectly good reason why shelters have a ton of dogs aged between 1 and 2 years old.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "Hey,\n\nI have been working at this small software company for about 2.5 years now as a full stack developer (first job after graduating with a CS degree). The company only has four employees and only two of us are developers (the current director of technology and me). It is still a young company so we are still very actively developing the product, which is a web application used by large businesses in their day to day operations.\n\nYesterday we had a meeting and it was announced that our director of technology is stepping away from his full time position to a more part time/consulting role where he'll only be putting in 10-20 hours a week. Later I was told by our main boss that he and the director of technology talked about how to go about this and the director of technology was adamant that I was capable of filling the role. He mentioned that he needs a few days to put together the numbers but then we'll talk about an increase in compensation since I'll be taking on more responsibilities. I'm not sure if my title would change or not.\n\nI am confident that I can do the job, but I am a little concerned that the compensation increase may not adequately reflect the responsibilities that I'm being given. I am currently being paid below market for the area especially considering I already had a ton of responsibilities, so I'm worried that the new compensation will only really get me up to where I probably should have been in the first place. I have also been in the process of interviewing with a different company in the last few weeks to try to get a better gauge on my market value but I'm still in that process so I haven't received an official offer from them yet to compare against, but from the looks of it I would be paid considerably more at that company.\n\nHow do I go about negotiating this if the salary my boss pitches to me is below my expectations? I only have 2.5 years of experience but at the same time they're asking me to fill a role of someone with 20+ years of experience. What is reasonable for me to ask for? Should it be more than a mid level developers salary?\n\nSome more info about the business:\n\nEven though its a young company that could still be considered a startup, I know that we're very stable financially and the last few months have been especially good to us. To my knowledge there are no immediate plans of hiring another person. So in theory with the director of technology taking a step back there should be plenty of funds to add to my compensation... Also for what its worth I really enjoy working here. Everyone is great and the culture is very relaxed.",

Yes, as the person leading development of our embedded product I have a good degree of control of how things are implemented, but I have no input into the conversations around \"how we as a company can help our customers given our product\". Any promise of that in the future always get trumped \"temporary\" business needs of me needing to churn out more product as code monkey doing what it's told. All that makes me feel like I should be more actively deciding on a career realignment instead of hoping it would happen organically. Because what I see ahead of myself is just getting more and more shoehorned into being a developer.\n\nHas any of you have made a jump from development to something with more higher-level problem solving? What's your story? How did you find yourself there?",

        "body": "Long story short, I am early thirty guy living in the Netherlands. Originally studied physics at Uni, even went on and did a phd because I was passionate about the topic. Left academia and has been working as a developer in the whole \"Data\"-business for the past 6 years. I don't like buzz words but titles have come and gone so much, but just to give an idea of I am doing I have been called things such as data engineer,data scientist, big data develeper and even machine learning engineer etc.... The past 4 years I have been working as an independent contractor (zzp), as I enjoy my freedom.\n\nUnless a fellow colleague in the Netherlands corrects me, the tech industry scene is not great there. So I have mostly worked in Brick and Mortar companies (telco, finance, retail, logitistics, fashion etc..). While covid19 obviously meant externals getting laid off, and I was no exception there, it became also a blessing for my career as a lot of companies are seeking contractors in other countries. This is were I got a taste of working at a tech company, tbh still surprised they were hiring contractors. There is a clear noticeable difference in mentality between tech and brick&mortar people. It was an amazing experience to have such talented and motivated colleagues. More on that later.\n\nSadly, things are never easy, I was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer a couple of months ago. Unsurprisingly, I had to let go of my current contracts to prioritize my treatment. \n\nI am about three quarter into the treatment process now. It has been not easy of course. You think you will be the exception, and that you will overcome the side effects, but they hit you like a truck.\n\nSomehow by miracle, I was able to negociate a contract with another tech to start towards the end of my treatment. In the period of my treatment, I was approached as well by two FANG companies for remote permanent. Out of curiosity, I followed the process with one of them and was even invited for online onsite interviews. As the side effects were intensifying, and I stopped the process.\n\nWork has always played a very central role to me. I am very passionate. Being able to improve and push myself to master my craft is very important to me. Cancer, however, is making me question a bit where I want to go with my career.\n\nAs I mentionned at the beginning, I worked mostly at Brick and Mortar. While I respect the people I have worked with, I do think B&M are the worst and most depressing places to work at as a developer. I often like to compare IT departments with Coat Hangers. Nice to have in the house, looks fancy and it's fun to display your coats (developers), but of course you rarely wear most of them (i.e. you can easily get away doing nothing for months and nobody will notice nor care). Everybody is different and , yes, some do enjoy the peaceful life of low pressure calm work. In my case, I have always needed action. I spend quite a lot of time initiating a lot of projects while working at these companies. It always felt I was a mule dragging a cart while 3-4 other people would pull in other directions. As you may guess already, I definitely was not the greatest friend with my managers. I do, however, take pride that I worked on some of the most innovative projects. I count myself lucky, despite the fights, that my managers's managers always saw me in high regard and always provided me with great recommendations which allowed me to keep moving forward.\n\nSince the cancer, however, and not being in my twenties anymore, I fear I will not have the energy anymore to fight similar battles. The though of working as contractor again at brick & mortar makes me almost as nauseous as my chemotherapy. I don't think I will always be able to work as an independent contractor with tech companies. Possibly, renouncing my freedom and  taking the opportunity to work as an employee at FANG (Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google) could be interesting, but looking at glassdoor it looks like I would be making less than I am making now (at least if I have a decent year with 10-11 month billeability).  My problem as well is that I am not really interested in working as a manager. I love working as an individual contributor. Bossing people around does not interest me. I want to refine my craft, keep innovating and building exciting stuff. This is one of the main reason I am   less interested in working as a employee. Being an employee feels like you are stuck in some cage where the only way to grow is climbing the ladder. I hate all the politics and petty backstabbing for silly meaningless titles. I take pride in what I create, not whatever non-sensical imaginary title or how many people are sucking up to me.\n\nHow would people want to move forward? Are there maybe some interesting companies and projects in the Netherlands I am not considering?",

My city is one of the most expensive in Portugal so I would expect a bit more, but that's fine I wanted to start working.\n* From the second day since I was hired they put me on tickets giving me deadlines of 1 day up to 4 days. I had to study the code base + all the tools I had never seen + some specific languages/frameworks they used without having the time to understand properly, especially with tickets with a 1 day deadline. I am an entry level, as much as I like learning new things it is impossible to learn in a good way and at the same time solve the ticket before the deadline. I am also afraid to make mistakes because of my lack of knowledge. For now I have respected the deadlines but I had to hurry a lot.\n* They don't explain anything, they just say \"this is the project, clone it and solve the tickets\".

I'm a  software developer (Junior Mobile Dev - I do mainly iOS but from time to  time I help out in Android project in our company). In November it will  be 1 year since I become professional developer, before I had an  technical cloud support role and been customer service in some VR games  places. So I'm pretty happy with myself and my progress through the  years mainly because I was programming for only 4 years now (since I  started my first studies which I eventually left for my Bachelor of  Informatics degree). Now I'm ending my Bachelor Degree in month or two.  I'm thinking about applying for Master degree in Germany or in some  other country in EU (Netherlands are on my list too :D). I'm from Poland  BTW so it is somewhat a big deal for me while I have really no love for  my country right now and always wanted to see how it is to live in some  foreign country for longer time. But it came to my mind: Did I really  need this masters degree? My studies right now aren't so appealing to  me, I learn much more in my job etc. I have possibility to work remote,  so I could probably just travel and work. What would you do on my  position? Do you think that Master degree will help my in anyway or  maybe it just waste of time if I'm passionate about my work and learning  by myself. (While all I learned for job interviews etc I just did of  pure interest, and outside studies curriculum.)",

Offer will more than likely start at around 135k per [h1binfo.info](https://h1binfo.info) (roughly a 12% increase)\n\nCurrent Job:\n\nPros: Great flexibility with time off and sick days, 30-minute max commute one way, absolutely wonderful coworkers, caring and empathetic management, great team culture, opportunity to learn a little about a whole lot of things (jack of all trades master of none), you are pushed to get 3rd party certifications, literally no micromanaging, respect work/life balance and do not expect work off-hours, and they do not fire people\n\nCons: Current role does not translate into a career unless you want to go into management for the department, locked into my current role within the company for two years (I'm about a year and a half in), you are pushed to get 3rd party certifications, little flexibility with working hours (day always has to end at 5 no matter how early I start), 50-70% customer-facing which I want to get away from, standing customer engagements which I also want to get away from, generally most of the expected tasks have become tedious/boring \n\nThis job that I'm at is probably tied for the best I've ever had and I've never had this kind of support from a Manager before - I had something of a nervous breakdown while dealing with some substance abuse issues a few months into quarantine. Without any hesitation, he gave me a whole week off and checked in on me to make sure that I was doing well. \n\nWith all of that said it is definitely a difficult choice for me to even consider leaving the company. However...\n\nWhat I know/been told about the new position:\n\nI will be part of a new department within the company so there is an opportunity to be at the start of something from the ground up (fast-paced start-up style type of growth), flexible working hours, will be about 20% customer work (no scheduled, standing customer meetings only working on tickets), 45-60 minute commute one way, could potentially offer a shuttle to the office (still WFH until further notice, probably until August)\n\nI'm at a point in my life where it would behoove me to make as much money as I can until the next big thing, which is moving out of the country and marrying my fiance. I'm going to a place where 50k USD translates to 200k locally which you can live on very comfortably for about 3-4 years so it would be great to max out the USD earnings. This company that I am applying to also has offices in that country as well. While there might be a possibility for a transfer, there are roles there that I would be qualified for if I had to reapply\n\nWith all that said if the current job I was at wasn't almost perfect, this wouldn't be a difficult decision. I've always followed the money throughout my career in tech and it's worked out well so far which is why I'm feeling like I should do the same here. I'm also considering having that big name on my resume as well. But this time is definitely different and I for sure am heavily considering how great management has treated me up to this point. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this and to get this far. Any and all insights are appreciated! Thank you in advance",

I have lurking this subreddit since 2018 and I cant believe my time has come!\n\nMy background is that I am graduate from a small college in Canada majoring in CS. I always believed that you needed coop to land internships but I was clearly wrong. I sent over 2000+ applications and went on approximately 50 interviews. In the end I ended up volunteering for a company as a software developer. My CTO saw that I was hard working and putting in 110% of my work and decided to offer a paid position in the company for the summer.  I will be working Software Engineer Intern( though ill be mostly doing QA work hehehe)\n\nMy advice, don\u2019t give up. Keep trying because when you give up you\u2019ve admitted defeat. Also if you can\u2019t get an internship or a FT job, work as a volunteer part time, you will make alot of connections and you gain alot of experience. If not you\u2019re into that then work on side projects, they helped alot in making my application look more appealing.\n\nMy plan for the future is to get into my masters hopefully , grind Leetcode and DS and Algo and hopefully get another internship or a FT role.\n\nGood luck everyone, you will definitely succeed.\n\nLink to my sad post, I made a few months back: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mnva5k/cant_find_a_job_sad_post/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

        "body": "Edit: I started off this post with the intention of asking one thing but it changed somewhere along the way into the entire situation Im in.\n\nI'm a 2020 grad who started his first job in September. My company made all the new grads undergo a couple of months of basic training of things like Python, SQL, AWS etc. I finally joined my team in mid-December and after a couple of weeks of getting permissions, setting stuff up etc, I started getting assigned work from Jan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts been five months now and I have not really done much - the majority of tasks assigned to me are of one of these types:\n\n1. Bugs which have been resolved in other versions of the product, where I basically have to replicate the changes made. A lot of these are assigned to me with the idea that I will be exposed to diff parts of the codebase and get more functional knowledge of the product\n2. Minor UI changes\n3. Writing of some selenium tests which are pretty basic and generally follow the same format\n4. Automation related tasks - run an automation suite, analyze whether all tests passed. If not, raise issues for the ones which failed\n\nTo be very honest, I have gone into auto pilot mode the last couple of months. With the pademic still going on and the monotony of wfh, my motivation was completely gone. Back in 2020, I was interning at a 'better' company but due to multiple reasons, one of them being covid, I did not get a full time offer. Recently I had seen folks with < 1 YOE applying to and getting into some top companies which I had deemed unlikely as I thought companies would not be willing to hire someone who is between the 0-1 year mark in experience. But on seeing this, I started leetcoding and stopped putting any effort into my actual job. I had started basically copying the code changes which I needed to replicate without even trying to analyze them, procrastinate on the other work as well.   \n\n\nI ended up giving a few OAs (Linkedin and a few good local product companies) and did not get through them. On getting some advice from some more experienced people, I am considering staying put until around July -August when I can pass off as a 1 YOE guy and then applying again, and continuing to improve at LC in that time. But now its starting to hit me that it will soon be close to a year without me having done any actual coding and Im not sure what I will say when asked in interviews about my experience. I wanted to get this sub's opinion on this situation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone been in this sort of situation where they were not getting any major work as a new grad and their coding skills suffered as a result?\n\nI am considering applying to other places and am doing leetcode prep on the side. One thing which worries me is what I would say when asked about my contributions at my first company. All I can really say is that I completed my tasks(without being proactive tbh) and delivered requirements on time. Would this be accepted? I see so many people who put on their resumes about what they designed or built etc etc\n\nHow do I bring this up with my manager? Should I be honest with him that I had kind of slacked off the past couple of months and not been making an active effort to learn the codebase(which is insanely vast and I still am not confident with).",

I began to work at the same company I did my internship with (a very very large private corporation). Ive been there for about two years now and am leading a lot of development and architecture in my group as the lead has moved to a different team so the amount of work I have is substantially more than a year ago. I\u2019m in south central Kansas so cost of living is pretty low. \n\nI have been getting a lot of recruiters messaging me so I decided to see what was out there in the market. \n\nAfter a few interviews, I got an offer from a large consulting company (considered big 4 on the business side). \n\nNow I want to lay down my situation and see if anyone has any wise words. I don\u2019t have anyone in my personal life that I could speak to and could relate to my situation so I thought I\u2019d ask here. \n\nCurrent Compensation: 77k (possible 5k raise by end of this month). 401k matching, full benefits. Full time, salary, rarely work more than 40 hours. I\u2019ve really enjoyed my time here and enjoy the people I work with, although I would like to get out and experience more of the world since I was raised here in Kansas. There is also a strict business casual dress code and working remote or from home is very limited. \n\nNew offer: 95K, full remote, option to work in DC or Austin, TX if I prefer to have an office. Similar benefits although the 401k matching is a bit weaker ($0.25 per dollar up to 6% vs 100%% up to 6%). This gives me the chance to own my life a bit more and flexibility to move to a new city in the future without having to find a new job. \n\nI am feeling very stressed about this decision and not telling my current employer about the situation. I\u2019m worried that I could do poorly at the new job or be falling behind when at my current company I\u2019m doing extremely well. I am nervous about having the conversation of leaving etc. \n\nI\u2019ve never made a move like this in my professional career and I would really appreciate advice on whether I should take this offer or any advice anyone else can provide. \n\nThank you all very much!",

I know that it's given to an employee if he fails to meet the target for a period. \n\nToday, I was invited to a meeting with no subject which I attended. To my surprise, it wasn't about regularization, instead it was about PIP that I never was warned before.\n\nOur office is a contractor and has clients abroad. During the meeting, my manager simply showed a PIP form and explained that it's being issued to me because I didn't meet the metrics and expectation of client. That's when I started to get confused. \"No specific metrics were discussed to me since I joined\" I thought that I jist need to work on the task assigned to me per sprint.\n\nSome of the metrics/target I saw on the PIP are about ensuring at least >=10 lines of code merged per sprint, ensuring that you avoid getting task carried over to next sprint etc. All of which were never discussed to me since I joined the company. And now, there I was in the meeting being issued a PIP right on my face when I wasn't even oriented about the goals. No warning, no monitoring, just straight PiP that they said I need to acknowledge.\n\nI expressed my confusion and feelings about it to my manager(contractor side) and he told me that they will help and that I just need to get through it. In other words, just accept it. And that they didn't know about those specific metrics of client, which I find a miss on their part. They just told me that my feedback will be communicated and feedback is appreciated.\nI got so pissed because I think it is so unjust and unfair to just issue a PIP to an employee when on the other hand it's them who failed to communicate to me what my metrics are. And I'm on my 7th month, not even a year. How the hell would I know those specific targets if they don't identify and ask those from client. There are sprints where there are only UX tasks. (I do backend btw)\n\nTheir miss, my record/reputation's expense.\n\nSorry, I'm a little getting carried away.\nNow, I've been thinking that I wouldn't want to stay in an office with that kind of system and management. I'm only on my7th month. In my previous offices, shortest stay was 2.5years.\n\nI am now planning to look for another office and apply actively then leave my current office once hired.\n\nBut, I would like to know your thoughts and advice on this matter. Cause maybe, someone here had experienced something similar.

        "body": "TL;DR - Coming from IT and working in first DevOps role and it's a nightmare. I'm absolutely lost on where to go from here.\n\nTo start, I'm in Canada so I don't know what it's like to be able to apply to hundreds of jobs a week. I don't really have that opportunity where I live.\n\nI'm a little over 3 years in the industry at this point. I worked at an MSP to start. Worked up from the help desk to a project based role and landed a DevOps position 8 months ago. It took time to land this role. I dedicated a lot of personal time to studying, getting certified (Azure Administrator), and working on personal projects.\n\nThings started out ok. I've worked a lot with AWS, Terraform, GitLab for pipelines, a ton of bash scripting, collaborating with devs. I've honestly learned a lot and have done some really cool things with Terraform that I'm proud of but it's really turned out to be a nightmare overall.\n\nThis company is about 50 employees total, been around for about 10 years, and I'm the sole DevOps person there. This is my first DevOps position and I was brutally upfront about my skills and experience but showed a willingness to learn which helped me land this role. Here's some issues I'm having:\n\n* First and foremost, the CEO is a bit nuts. He singles people out in chat and asks things like \"Why did you do this?\" \"Why didn't this person catch this?\" anytime something goes wrong. He flips out anytime there is any issues whatsoever, dropping F bombs in chat when something happens. He micromanages everyone. He'll directly message me repeatedly all throughout the day asking me to look into whatever so happened to cross his periphery at that time which he's now deemed critical. I don't get clear instructions on requirements from him at all.\n* I spoke with my manager about the CEO micromanaging me and he has backed off a little bit recently, but it's still there, and there are so many other problems with this person that just make it really hard to work with him.\n* The CEO \"doesn't do\" tickets, any message received from him in chat is good enough and I should drop everything I'm doing to look into whatever he's asking and most of the time it's way above me. I can't communicate with him through tickets either, I need to chase him down in chat anytime I need clarification on something because he never answers.\n* We have project managers that are absolutely useless. Everything is critical, everything needs to be done by end of day, no clear instructions from them ever.\n* Developers never stop working. This especially includes the CEO. I receive messages from him at 3 AM asking for my thoughts on things, or asking me to fix a deployment he messed up, because despite the fact I've done multiple personal calls with him to walk him through the deployment process, and written detailed documentation complete with screenshots, he still circumvents it, looks for shortcuts, messes things up, then flips out when everything breaks in the middle of the night because he decided to deploy to production.\n* My role isn't clearly defined to anyone else. Everyone thinks I'm the administrator of every single system we have and service we use. Anytime there's the slightest issue with anything I need to drop what I'm doing and fix it. It wouldn't be so much of a problem, but we have like 50+ random EC2 instances that were set up before my time and there is no documentation for any of it. I would love to clean this up, reduce systems, find better ways to run them that's more inline with best practices but I'm honestly just firefighting all day with developers and random other things that get assigned to me.\n* I have no time to really dive into some other things I would like to help grow as a DevOps Engineer. There are so many tools and processes I would love to research and attempt to look into but honestly with the way it's been with the CEO who doesn't listen, doesn't bother using processes I've set up, flips out when there's problems, I've just lost all motivation and desire to even try implementing anything else or improving anything.\n* I've been volunteered as the head of all security policies and runbooks, despite the fact I'm not actually writing anything at all it's being done behind the scenes without my involvement yet they put my name on documents.\n* No documentation for anything except for what I've wrote for the processes / pipelines I've developed. I'm coming from IT and have a solid background in documentation, it's something I've always placed a great deal of importance with.\n* No monitoring aside from some pretty useless CloudWatch alerts / dashboards we have set up. I would love to really dive into this area, and load testing as well, but see my point above regarding the CEO. I've honestly just lost all motivation to start on anything like this because of him.\n* No leads. No code reviews. Everything is under the birds eye view of the CEO. There are people who direct deployments, but they're not developers. There are so many issues with deployments I don't even know where to start.\n* Devs connect to production databases for development.\n* Things are way too fast. I'm talking deployments to production causing issues, anything I ever work on needs to be done ASAP as well. I'm not part of any discussions or meetings outside of the daily standups which are a joke.\n* Daily standups are absolutely useless. The project managers just talk about what's being deployed for 5 mins, while everyone else sits in silence in the call, but then I get singled out and asked what I'm working on and when it will be done. No one has any idea of what I'm talking about and it just feels so awkward.\n\nDespite all of the above, it honestly started out well when I was less in contact with the CEO. I got to really dive into Terraform and AWS, and had fun setting up and learning new things. The pipelines I developed were challenging but fun to work on, and I love seeing them in action. I love helping people, and collaborating with devs to accomplish this stuff with them.\n\nNow, I just look at the place and see how much wrong there is and I can't fix all of it. I can't fix the culture. I can't change the CEO. I can't fix everything I'd like to on AWS or our processes. It's all just such a mess and I'm so overwhlemed. I'm filled with anxiety every time I start something when there's something else that's being put off that I should do. It's unsustainable.\n\nI took the last week off and have been hammering out applications (I've actually been doing this for the past month), but I'm getting nothing back. I'm trying to go for DevOps / SRE positions and am trying to stay remote, but I'm not getting any interest.\n\nSo here I am, I have less than 1 year in DevOps, and a little over 2 years in IT. I don't know if I should keep trying for DevOps / SRE positions, or just give up on it since I'm not getting any interest back. I've thought about going back to IT, but I honestly don't think I have it in me to go back to something so service oriented.\n\nI'm so lost and just wondering if I should just give up on the tech industry altogether.",

I have my BBA in Marketing, but originally wanted to get a degree in CS however this never happened due to my lack of knowledge of how college really worked (First Gen Graduate). I got my general undergrad coursework done at a local community college and then transferred to a state college, during this process I found out that if I wanted to get a degree in CS, that I would basically have to retake much of my general coursework as it was going to require that I get much of the foundational coursework done despite already having my associate degree. So essentially I was looking at going to school for another 3-4 years to get a CS degree vs continuing with a business degree in 2 years. Due to financial/time constraints, I went the BBA route (and highly regret this decision).\n\nTwo years ago I graduated with my BBA and have been unable to find anything professionally in the field. I am about to turn 25 years old and am feeling like if I want to make a career/field change, now is the time to do it. It doesn't help I'm not really interested in Marketing, but I am interested in software dev as I feel that it would be much more in my spectrum of interests and fit me as a person better. I have a little self-taught knowledge of python/html/css/js, but nothing significant enough to gain employment. My hope would be to utilize something of my Marketing degree, potentially the UX/UI knowledge that I gained during my studies.\n\nJust some background info: I am married and my wife and I both have income, I would be able to work part-time and attend school/camp if the opportunity arose. She makes enough income to support us both if necessary for a period of time. I live in Arkansas, while there are not a vast amount of employment opportunities in my city, we live pretty close to Little Rock which has some SE jobs posted pretty regularly, though we would be willing to move if necessary. \n\nMy question is this, what would be the best route in my case to reach employment in the SE field?\n\n1.) I have been accepted to my local community college for pursuing a second bachelor in CS, my situation is similar to when I was in college the first go around, I will require all of the foundational classes and since this would be my second bachelor, I would be paying out of pocket/getting loans to pay. Either way, I assume it would be helpful to take some of the intro to CS classes there.\n\n2.) Should I seek a masters degree in CS? There is a college here that offers a \"Master of Computer and Information Science\" degree online and though it prefers students who have a CS background, it does allow for non-cs majors to apply after taking a couple of pre-req courses. This option seems like a good choice, but I get unsure when I consider the fact that I most likely will be lacking a lot of the core foundational knowledge of CS.\n\n3.) I've also considered attending a coding camp though I am a little weary of them. I've looked into Hack Reactor/App Academy/Coding Dojo. I like the idea of getting instant industry applicable skills, but I've also heard/seen some sort of shady stuff with some of the Bootcamps. I also wouldn't be able to lump sum pay for something like this so would need to consider the different financing options.\n\nWow, this post ended up a lot longer than I had hoped for, my apologies, and thank you for your input!\n\n**tl:dr- Non-CS grad seeking SE career. Would the best route of entry be a second bachelor in CS? Master in CS/MCIS through potential online college or bridge program? Coding Bootcamp?**",

I enjoy working with Linux Servers or Databases (both SQL, NoSQL) the most. \n\nI recently got AWS CCP certified and I am doing a side project to get some hands-on AWS. \n\nWhat I am thinking now is to be a Solutions Architect or System Engineer or Support Engineer.  I am thinking to get AWS SAA certified along with doing RHCSA certification. Am I doing it all wrong, wasting time and money? \n\nWhat type of jobs should I apply? I am unemployed since a year. I am trying to have my career back but at this point I am thoroughly confused. \n\nI do not want to be a Software Engineer anymore but a job where I could work with Linux servers, databases, use SQL (I can write complex queries), light weight Python automation and do troubleshooting. \n\nPlease help me.

One was due to lack of interest (which I realized later) and another one was due to classes going online. The resume I applied with only lists my bachelor\u2019s degree and I was offered this job based on the submitted resume. We never spoke about graduate school, and I didn\u2019t bring it up myself. They have also successfully completed my background check.\n\nThe industry I work in is tight knit, and some people knew that I had tried to pursue those degrees.

        "body": "I'm a Senior Engineer. My team's manager got moved to another team and my lead got promoted to manager. The lead put in his 2-weeks notice, so our team is basically manager-less. This is why our Director of Engineering is managing us right now.\n\nI've been working at this company for 8 months and had my first performance review comprised of nothing but great feedback. \n\nI had my first two 1-1s with the director, the first of which was very casual, but the next was a shocker. I was called out on:\n\n1. Having too many PRs open, closed, and in draft\n2. Having too many commits\n3. Too many comments from others in my PRs\n4. Pushing commented code & code with git artifacts in it\n\nIn my defense:\n\n1. Since the start of the quarter, my team has reprioritized a lot of work, and there hasn't been a discussion about what to do with the work that we all started. Also, I open a draft PR the moment I make my first commit on a branch. I do this for visibility, and in case someone needs to take over the work.\n\n2. I also commit a lot. Commits are my safety net. I use `git reset` tremendously throughout the day to go back to different states in the code I'm working on.\n\n3. The director mentioned that he expects senior engineers to have very little chatter on their PRs. They should be ready to merge with very little discussion. What he failed to recognize that were almost all of the comments on my PRs are from Hound, our linter. Rather than linting before pushing, I actually enjoy waiting for Hound's comments and fixing them afterward.\n\n4. Here I made a mistake. I've been forced to comment out code recently in some of our microservices as a temporary fix while working locally. I forgot to uncomment the code before pushing to GitHub. The director went through my commits and saw some commit messages like \"uncomment code\", \"remove commented block\", and reprimanded me for that.\n\nI've been an engineer for more than 10 years and no one has called me out on any of this. This is how I like to work. I don't see a real problem here. \n\nI can squash my commits, lint locally, and stay blocked when services aren't working on my machine. But I'm mostly concerned about why this director is calling out this bullsh*t.\n\nI spoke to my former manager, and he said it'd just be easier to appease him. But it feels like the director is looking for a reason to let me go by finding incompetencies in my performance. I do not want to work in fear or with paranoia.\n\nShould I have a chat with the director's manager to ask about the feedback and what he suggests I do about it?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**BONUS**\n\nAnother reason I think this feedback may be in bad taste is because of this:\n\nWe've recently been given one of those typical sexual harassment training assignments which were to be complete in a month (due, say, May 15). On my day off last week, I got an email from the director saying, \"I know you're OOO, but we need you to finish the sexual harassment training **today**.\" After checking my email, it was still due May 15th, not May 8th. I completed it, of course (to shut him up), but that still leaves me with one question: Why would this guy message me on my day off with such urgency to complete something that was not even due? It feels like he's really trying to catch me slacking.",

I was very much bothered by lack of interest from the management to promote from within despite people working crazy hours or outworking every other colleague. Also for note, this is my only IT experience.\n\nI followed this subreddits as well as [r/ITCareerQuestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) guidance on Resumes, interviews, salaries, career progressions and other.\n\nBecause of that I found myself with two offers in two differing companies. I was not able to decide which one to follow with since.\n\n**Company A.) Graduate Technical Support Specialist**  \n27.500 Euro a year \\~ 25 days off \\~ no other benefits.\n\nThe Company provides software akin to Mobility Management and other things. The type of work as L1 support will allow me to tackle any issues as L1's take full ticket ownership, so if there is a very difficult ticket I can work on it to try and solve if its not over my head.\n\nThis will make me be able to do a work that I enjoy in stable office hours and work with corporate clients who know what they're doing to some degree. I can also work outside of working hours to work on my specific ticket. There's no HelpDesk or anything of the sort so they do not handhold you and wave numbers and quotas above your head.\n\nBecause of nature of the company I think the progress within it will be slow, but they use different interesting technologies and focus on networking a lot which I could apply in day-to-day basis.\n\nIf not for benefits + School which I will explain below I would chose this one.\n\n**Company B.)** **Customer Support Specialist**  \n32.000 Euro a year +5% p/a bonus \\~ 25 days off full dental + health cover for me&fam + other benefits\n\nThis Corporation deals with GRC and in the last year they have opened a new customer support hub that will be the only support hub globally. They use random shifts with new employee logging in on every hour to ensure constant coverage and the job is being done via HelpDesk where the clients call to the customer support representatives.\n\nThey have again and again highlighted that they want technically gifted people to be selected from L1 candidates within about half a year so they can fill up tens of new positions as once again they opened this support hub semi recently so those positions are being made/waiting to be filled.\n\nThey will be looking at numbers and I need to be by my station 24/7 as it often happens with HelpDesk types of scenarios. Also they look at metrics and it scares me a lot because I would love to help people to the best of my ability instead of pushing them out asap.\n\nAlso, those strange working hours would more easily allow me to finish my Software Dev Undergrad where I miss only three classes that need to be taken during the day AND I need to get my dental work done.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI have about 25k saved so I'm not in the worst place monetarily but I'm not sure if I want to take the jump into a work I could potentially hate for half a year where I will know what's what or start looking elsewhere.\n\nThe first Job is more interesting but has lower salary and benefits, as well as possibly much slower progress, but I would enjoy it more and it would be more of technical challenge. The second I will be stressing over metrics over months and hoping they pull me over for something more technical than learning product from 'the kitchen', while simultaneously they provide better benefits/pay and perhaps a career opportunity.\n\nSorry if I'm rambling, I have gotten zero sleep at night over this and thank you everyone for weeks of supporting people here which helped me in turn as well.\n\nThanks everyone!",

        "body": "Hello guys, I am a self-taught web developer, I started learning front-end at the end of last year, I've landed two jobs as a front-end dev with REACT, both of the jobs were really bad(on the company policy part, one of them was against my rights), after those two jobs, I soon realized I am more interested in the backend development, so after quitting, I studied a month of basic backend knowledge and then landed an internship as a backend engineer in a start-up.\n\nDuring the internship, though my position was called \"backend engineer\", but my duty was actually using AWS CDK to do IAC for our service, I had a great time learning cloud services and knowledge about internet, and the crew was really nice to me. But because of the company's lack of budget, they had to let go all the devs including me. After this short but awesome experience, I was almost certain that I want to be a backend Dev in the future, so I started to develop my own side project.  I am an admin in an English study group and we hold events every week, I decided to created a web app to optimize the registration process so I started develop it with something I haven't tried out yet. \n\nRight now the first version of my app is done on the backend, but because of my friend (she's in charge of UI designing), my side project is not ready to be deployed yet, so I thought maybe I could demonstrate my backend code and get into the job market.\n\nAfter a week of browsing and applying some of the junior jobs, I feel a bit frustrated, I feel like I suit most of the junior job and still feel like I don't. I really don't know what should I do now, should I keep searching for the job? or should I learn something else? \n\nIf I should learn something else, where should I go? should I keep optimizing my backend service, or just keep learning new things? My friend always tells me to \"master\" one thing, and I honestly don't know where to start, I am currently learning data structures, CS knowledges and algorithms when I am not searching for jobs, is that sufficient? I've been considering maybe getting a AWS certificate, but I really don't know if it helps since $150 is quite expensive for me at the moment..\n\nI truly love this industry and the knowledge of everything about this, but I just feel so lost in this sea of tools, languages and knowledge.. \n\nWhat do you guys suggest?",

        "body": "As someone who has just recently graduated from a CS bachelors program, I have no idea what benefit I have over someone who graduated from, say, only a bootcamp (all else being equal), and I have been having a hard time finding the answer to this question. The closest answer I have gotten is that 'bootcamp grads usually can't apply to embedded entry level jobs.' (No hate to bootcamp grads though. All respect for anyone trying to hustle to make something of themselves in this world.)\n\nI have heard so much rhetoric about the different types of jobs available to SENG and CS grads, and how those grads don't make 'software stacks'(MERN, MEAN, etc.) their main selling point as a bootcamp grad might. I have heard that once you start defining youself by these stacks, then that usually means you are a web developer. I don't want to become a web developer at the end of the day, but I don't know what to look for in an entry level job description that will keep me off that path.\n\nWhat I am trying to point out, is that there seems to clearly be some distinction about the doors that a CS degree can open, but looking at the market and job ads in Canada, I can't seem to see that distinction in entry level positions. Either the job ads are asking you to be familiar in some software stack and the job is web-dev related, or the experience and tech required is so absurd that I find it hard to believe that any fresh grad would have that experience. I have only checked linkedin job ads though. \n\nWhat kind of entry jobs should I be looking for as a fresh CS grad (and as such, are available to me as a fresh grad), where I would generally not be competing with bootcamp grads? By this I mean, what search filters should I be using to find such positions, or what should I look for in job descriptions to keep me away from jobs heavily applied to by bootcamp grads? It is hard to not sound condescending when asking this question but know it is not my intention.",

I switched from biology to software engineering the end of my sophomore year, so I was very behind and in order to graduate on time and to save me thousands of dollars (from taking extra semesters) I took about 3 summer classes each summer on top of the usual 4-5 classes during a normal semester. I am about to graduate soon, but since I have been rushing and catching up with the large amounts of classes I needed to take in a quick time, I've had no time for internships or any real world situations. Graduating without an internship I feel like is going to make it super hard to get an entry level job, as employers would probably hire someone that has had an internship or CS work experience over me.\n\nHas anyone here been in the same boat? Or has tips for what I should do to stand out as a good hire? I have a few projects on my github, and my senior group project is pretty decent (but is focused on cybersecurity not software engineering).",

This is going to be an explanation of my situation with a friendly request of pep talk/advice at the end. \n\nBit of background: I graduated 4 years ago with a CS-lite degree. \nIt's focus being on networking and security with a side of information management. It taught me the fundamentals of how to troubleshoot effectively, think critically, and most importantly self teach. Now due to my youthful foolish college ways I graduated with a not so attractive GPA (2.7 but whose counting). As such I pounced on the first job offered which ended up being entirely SQL based. Though I had exposure to SQL it wasn't something I had known in depth. Despite this the requirements for the job were low as was the pay. (I'm not trying to sound ungrateful, it remains one of the biggest pride points for me though now being slightly seasoned I am aware what the standards for the industry are.)\n\n\nFast forward a couple years, I am still in the same city I moved to for the job. I have established friends and a girlfriend I'm very happy with, things are nice. (Enter life and uncertainty) The small software company I work for gets bought out and recent restructurings have made me want to look elsewhere.\n\n\nMy personal problem is that I've been on a SQL only diet for about 4 years now and getting mixed messages from the internet as to the viability of that skillset long-term. My preferences for work I have found are being back of house interfacing with customers as little as required though I can do it when necessary and get complimented on my people skills. What I want to do isn't being a BA or manager-type however it's to be a dev/software engineer. I know I need a real scripting/programming language to move into that but it's all so daunting. I've been saying for a year now I'm gonna learn C# (my shop is .NET) but have not nearly but in enough hours to even grasp the fundamentals.\n\n\nIn all honesty half the reason I'm even looking towards other jobs and at my career is I don't want to be stuck with the legacy doom projects all my colleagues are leaving me with. I have a general sense of what I want and now have urgency but I simply lack the skills to make it happen. Do I do leetcode? Do I get back to school to get a CS degree? Bootcamp? There's so many options and it's overwhelming me into a mode where I do nothing and simply try not to think about it.\n\n\n**TLDR; Database dev wants to be a real dev/swe and is in paralysis on how to achieve.**\n\n\nGonna leave the tag as experience.....it's just the wrong experience haha....",

        "body": "I'm currently in Program Management (I am currently the PMO Manager) and am tired of the project management world. I ended up here by unfortunately chasing money and authority. I was chasing the dream of executive management, but now that I am working daily with VPs and C-level people I realize it is nothing but massive problem after problem, politics, and long hours (evenings and weekend). I also realize my job has too much responsibility, too much stress, and is too people oriented. I think about my work 24/7 - I wake up in the night thinking about it.  That said there are tons of perks with my job, I have complete freedom over what I do each day (it is 100% up to me what I do - sometimes this drives me nuts) and no one is watching me work (I'm supposed to be watching others work). Every now and then I get into incredibly interesting initiatives and see first hand how the business is run from the top level. But I just can't see myself doing this for another 20 years.\n\nWhen I look back on my university scores I realized that my best grades were in programming. I loved programming, and was good at it, but I was always afraid it would be flooded with cheap labour and it wouldn't continue to pay well. Now that I am in a management position I can clearly see that will never happen - the quality from offshore firms is dumpster-tier and we only leave the most basic menial programming jobs to offshore. (sorry to my offshore friends- every now and then I meet one of you that is rockstar-tier).\n\nAll this said - has anyone else been in my position? Did you make the jump and how did it go? I'm afraid I'm going to miss the massive freedom I have in my position, the direct access to upper management for mentorship, the high pay ($125K+ base in a non- tech hub). That said I would love love love to have someone just tell me what to do and I can pop in some earbuds and sit down and code away in peace. I am not a social person, but I'm also not a recluse - I enjoy talking with people and making friends (something that went up in smoke once I got my first management post). But for the most part I am happier to be working solo.\n\nMy degree was a mix business/information technology, so I already have a base of programming, database, systems analysis -  I'm not starting from zero. Plus I've been around the IT world for 15 years. I've done hundreds of interviews and I can interview really well. I am thinking of going Python + Javascript + SQL route to build a baseline full stack skillset. I know html/CSS already. My biggest concern is getting a position that I can learn in. Oh yeah, I'm 45 so I wonder if this is going to be an issue.\n\nAny feedback from someone who has already been here is appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. if you are in the opposite situation (going from software dev to project management) message me if you need any advice. I'm happy to help but I'd rather keep this thread clean for people in the same situation looking for advice.",

However, I doubt those degrees will mean much in computer fields \ud83d\ude04. I am primarily working in health sciences-related chemistry (ie therapeutics) so it's not like my math is exceptionally strong\u2014 though I have taken multivar calc and linear algebra in college. After spending so many years in the lab, I realized that I don't really want to be a chemist for the rest of my life, and I'm not at all interested in staying in labwork. I also strongly dislike academic culture. And I much prefer to work at a computer.\n\n\nRight now I'm working through The Odin Project, which gears you up for webdev. I'm not that entirely interested in webdev as a career, but from what I read, it is easier to get a job in as self-taught. As a chemist, I enjoy brainstorming solutions and thinking about troubleshooting issues but I don't actually enjoy the physical labor of chemistry (I'm not interested in working with statistics so thats why I have ruled out cheminformatics and data science related to health sciences).\n\n\nSo,\u00a0 I think I would be into software engineering but the barriers of entry seem much higher. And I have been in school so long, IDK if I want to go back just for a CS degree lol.\u00a0I don't mind self learning at my own pace though. Or  online Master's are even worth it?

I have been working for a consulting firm for more than 10 years now in Data Analytics field(Building Reports/Dashboards). For the most part I really enjoyed it as I was working for different clients up and down the country. The projects usually lasted for not more than 5 to 6 months. Around 4 years ago I developed my interest in Data Science(DS) my company gave me couple of DS related projects which were great and I learned a lot. Then 2 years ago, I was given a project(let\u2019s call it Project X) that has absolutely nothing to do with Data Science and I\u2019m still working on this project. When I was given project X I got really annoyed as I knew that all the knowledge I gained from my DS projects will now be lost. I got really frustrated and started looking for job elsewhere just before Covid. As you know things were a bit unstable during Covid so I thought lets suck this up stay and stay with the Project X until Covid is done. The problem with my job is that I have no say over my career path. Recently I have come to realisation that maybe I should not only change my job but also my career path altogether.\nI have recently developed my interest in Software Engineering(SE) and I want to ask for your advice if you think switching from Data Analytics to Software Engineering is a wise move? I\u2019m not sure even if I\u2019ll be able find any job in SE that will match my current salary but I feel like there is much more potential to grow in SE than in Data Analytics/Data Engineering. With SE I\u2019ll be able to work for a company as well as the knowledge I\u2019ll gain, I can use it to do my own side hustles in Web Development domain. I think SE is much more dynamic field than Data Engineering. I have MSc degree in Software Engineering and I\u2019ve been doing on and off coding in Python and R for the last couple of years and I think I have decent technical background. I also don\u2019t mind learning and picking new languages such as Java.\nWhat are your thoughts?",

I am able to choose between a MS in F or BA since those are 10 month programs.

Would the BA degree set me up to seek a  data scientist job?\n\nCurriculum from the school:\n\nBA:  \n\nanalytics programming, data mining, data management, interactive data visualization, proficient in highly sought after analytics tools such as Python, SQL, Tableau and IBM SPSS Modeler\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nF:\n\n Portfolio Management,  Python for Finance ,  Corporate Finance,  Economics for Finance,  Financial Markets and Institutions ,  Equity Valuation and Modeling \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems to be BA is more CS oriented but I am not sure if it outweighs the value of the Finance degree.

The work is more project management based and hasn't really allowed me to delve into technical/analysis work which has led to me looking into software/tech as a potential career change. That being said my salary is above average for a graduate engineer, given the workload will become more intense as I progress.\n\nAfter enrolling and making progress on a beginner Python course from Udemy (which I've been really enjoying) I've been heavily considering my options on how to make this potential transition.\n\nI've dm'd a few individuals within this community regarding this, and have gotten excellent advice, but I would like to hear a more general consensus (if possible) regarding my situation.\n\nAt the moment I'm trying to spend my free-time both at work and at home to learn programming and any relevant skills.\n\nThe biggest concern I have is how and when I can make the transition into working within the tech space, with software dev more specifically.\n\nMy current plan is to do whatever I can on the side, and look out for any potential opportunities whilst continuing with this 2 year program for ATLEAST the next year.\n\nSome questions I have to the wider community more specifically:\n\nWill the next year be enough to learn programming, upskill and complete projects to a level enough for entry-level roles in the space?\nWould it be more important to go back to Uni and get a relevant comp sci degree (would be about 2 years given my free electives and such are eaten by my mech eng. courses) to help in my learning and garnering a formal qualification\nI've considered doing an online masters degree in something like data science or cyber security (which I can complete whilst working) but I'm not sure how relevant these could be for programming as a whole + it would require some prior knowledge I'd assume\nI do know that my current role will become more intense as I progress through the project lifecycle and become more involved with longer days/hours leaving less free-time for study which is why I'm considering a second degree.\n\nApart from that, any advice on potential next steps and how to move forward would really help solidifying my plan for the future.\n\nIf there's any more information I can provide please let me know.\n\nThanks everyone in advance.",

It\u2019s so hard for me to just think about that...\n\nI started looking into remote jobs available for engineers and 99% are software/ full stack dev jobs. I then started to look into it and saw some people successfully got full time job after learning coding and going through code camp. I just started a HTML and CSS course and feel excited about this path.\n\nMy question is do you think this is a right path? Do I need to go back to school and get a BS in Computer science since I really don\u2019t want to. What is the best way/program to learn and  be ready for the job? How much time should I devote for this journey?\nI\u2019m ready for it.\n\nThanks very much for any honest advices!!",

It is very repetitive and you don't require much cs knowledge to do it. As a result, I did not manage to gain any actual experience as I was doing the same thing day in and day out.\n\nIn these 2 years, for almost 1 year I was free. I did not had any work to do and no calls to attend. So i started doing leetcode. Its been around 5 months of leetcode now and I think Iam OK at it now.\n\n I know how to solve problems and I want to shift companies. The problem now is, I don't have any Skill or actual work experience to share with my future employer. All I know is how to leetcode and some basic select queries and creating stored procedures in database.\n\nI have been applying to many companies in this pandemic but none have reached out to me. I think the culprit is my lack lustre resume as I have nothing to to showcase as my actual work.\n\nIts just 2 years of bogus experience.\n\nSo what do I do? I can't apply for a Backend engineer role since I haven't worked on it.

        "body": "Hi all, I'm in really need for advice, so I hope it's OK to post this here.\n\nI'm a back-end developer with 7 years in exp. I worked in several companies, mostly doing APIs and dealing with dbs. I have a bachelors in Software Engineering + business, so it's like a weird combination and it lacks some areas of a \"traditional\" CS degree. I have also experience with working with front-end, although my skills are not at the same level of back-end, but I can pretty much find my ways of doing stuff in Typescript/Angular. I also deal with \"Ops\" stuff, like CI builds, Docker/K8s/Helm, but again, not an expert. I can prepare images and all the like but I'm not a infrastructure/network/security expert.\n\nAnyway I'm currently in a job which the tech stack is modern and it's the only reason why I wake up everyday and go to work. The team is awful. Management is awful. It's this culture of blaming when things go wrong, no support and I'd even go and say a bit of 'tech bros' culture. Another thing that is bothering me is I get these huge tasks, not even a high level specification, just a \"wish\" of what they want. I try to make meetings, to find out what is it that they want, most of the time the meeting gets hijacked by one of them (the tech bros) arguing about something that we'll not need in 10 years. Then  I have to work my ass off to do things, then when I present my ideas or what I came up with they say oh but that's not it, or let's change this.. so the task that should be 2 weeks becomes months, just bcs I have no way to know what they want. Make no mistake, I don't work 2 weeks without talking about it, I post on our chats, i create documentation, diagram. But nobody seem to care and they only care later on. Frustrates the hell out of me.\n\nSo this has been going for over 2 years now. Recently I decided to start looking around for jobs and I found out this one which looks very interesting but it's completely out of my comfort zone. The tech stack is different from the ones I work with, and not only that, it's a different domain, I'll be developing let's say tools for other devs.  I already had an interview with them and will be having a second one, so I guess they liked me. It was very technical, about the tech stack I work now, and there was some other general questions. I liked the interviewer, it was fair and felt more like a good conversation.\n\nSo, now I'm wondering what should I do. I'm kinda getting scared of jumping and then finding out it was too much to handle. I stalked some ppl there and they all seem super smart and working with like 3, 4 different languages, doing all sort of different things and I'm here like: Why they are even considering me? I only know 1 language \"well\" + front-end but not that deep.\n\nI kinda understand that if they decide to offer me the job, it's because they believe in my skills and my past track tells that given challenges and new things I have always overcome them. I'm excited about it and I think it will be great for me as a professional to broaden my skills but the imposter in me is telling me that this is TO much and I'm panicking a bit :).\n\nSo I guess what I'm after with this post is: What you think about moving to a job where you don't have much exp with the tech stack? What things could I ask during the interview to assess if they are really aware of the fact that I lack knowledge and also if I will be given the time/support to ramp up and become a productive member of the team? I'm aware of my fears and the shitty imposter syndrome holding me, but I'm afraid of jumping in, then been given tasks where I have no idea what to do and then not get support, specially now with Covid and prob not meeting the team IRL for some months. In the other hand it's not like it's raining cool jobs, so I'm also worried of moving then being fired or not liking it, and have lost what I have today. I have my savings and would be ok without a job for months but I would prefer not to be in that situation.\n\nSorry for the long post and thanks in advance :)",

My goal is to spend the next six months padding out my skill set where needed and start applying in the fall. The dream job would be using Rust + WASM + WebGPU to create high performance webApps. I don't see much demand for this right now but could see it growing as WASM matures.  \n\n\n**Skills I have**\n\n* Writing maintainable code - I wrote and maintain multiple Python packages my team uses. These range from data analysis libraries, to system models, to CLIs for sensor communication.\n* Showing a passion for programming with side projects -- my GitHub is pretty active with various side projects and I have a blog that I use as a brain dump as I learn new concepts. \n* CI/CD and VCS -- via GitLab runners and CircleCI.\n* Seeing a product through to release, managing schedules, technical leadership, and agile development.\n* Critical thinking/all those engineering goodies.\n* Python, Rust, C++, and Verilog proficiency.\n\n**What I See Myself Lacking**\n\n* Working on a large scale software project -- Most of my software projects are at best two people. I'm sure there's some subtleties that I'm not aware of when a project scales.\n* Deploying to AWS or similar. This pops up on a lot of job reqs, and it's on my todo list to get a basic REST API up and running to cut my teeth on it. \n* I've never written anything \"For production.\" Even work software doesn't extend outside of my team.\n\nEffectively, I see my pitch as being: \"Yes, I'm not from a software background, but I have 5+ years of experience delivering products in a high tech field with many parallels, a track record of learning and adapting to new situations quickly,  as well as professional & personal programming experience.\" Does this seem like a fair pitch or am I way off base? Are there any major things people recommend I pick up before starting to apply?",

        "body": "I have a question about executive roles in big tech companies.\n\nAs long as I have worked for them and followed them they always seem like they lack creative juices.\n\nThese execs are always in such a position of privilege and rarely do they ever seem to improve the products they govern. I'm not arguing that engineers would be better at coming up with product ideas and the general direction, but I do think that some people are naturally good at ideas and strategies.\n\nWhich is weird because these types of personalities are generally the engineers at a company. And the execs tend to be more like salesmen or managers grandfathered into their high status role.\n\nIdeas people should be execs. Not managerial people. These are two very different types of people. One type is good at managing others, details, facts, schedules. The other is good at big picture, creative, potentially a bit disorganized, and abstract thinkers.\n\nYet every exec I talked to so far is just a glorified manager. And their ideas are (no offense) usually pretty bad. I've seen great products get shafted by terrible ideas piled on top of it by people who have no understanding of what a good idea or bad idea looks like. And you can see this in almost every big tech company.\n\nWant a great example? Activision Blizzard. It's clear the higher ups are not interested in making good games or they don't understand game systems. They are so out of touch with the product that it just seems like the perfect example of this. It happens on a smaller scale at every tech company. And it makes me wonder why these people even need to exist. These execs remind me of DeeDee from Dexter's lab. They just run in and start pressing buttons and turning jobs and making noise hoping that they do something good and can take all the credit for it.",

After doing really well on the initial interview, I was sent the test and have been preparing for it religiously. After looking through many Reddit and Glassdoor posts, I was confident in my ability. Many of these posts stated that this company would be giving LeetCode easy or medium problems for this assessment but that was not the case at all. I assumed I would only take a few minutes for each problem but ended up taking up the whole time. Ended up with a syntax error I couldn't find in time on the first problem and was completely lost on the second.

I am a recent college graduate and believe my resume was pretty well written with a few projects under my belt and relevant work experience. I also had a referral for this entry-level software development position. I am not sure how the CodeVue assessments are graded was wondering if I still have a chance to pass this portion of the interview process? Should I contact a recruiter regarding this matter? If so, what should I even say to them? Or should I just move on and keep applying to different positions.

        "body": "So I'm just at the start of my journey, a few years out of college, but I'm finding myself failing to find any resemblence of a work-life balance at yet another job. I've worked as a programmer thrice so far and every single time, I'm facing the same problem - I cannot wrap my head around how to structure my days to still have a life. I've tried going corporate, I've tried smaller companies but the overarching problem remains the same.\n\nIn order to get to office at 9AM-ish, I wake up around 7:40 as my commute takes up around 40 mins in the morning and anything in the realm of 40min-70min in the evening depending on the traffic and accidents on the way back. So after I get out at 5PM, I'm home around 6PM, eat dinner and start my life around 6:40PM or so. In order to be able to live the next day, I have to go to bed around midnight, having prepared myself and sandwiches for breakfast and for work beforehand. \n\nThis realistically leaves me with 4 hours between 7PM and 11PM which does not sound _that terrible_ on paper but in reality, after work I'm so exhausted that these hours couldn't be further from any \"quality\" me-time. I feel like my brain is fried - both from having to _pretend_ to work for a large part of the past 8 hours (which I'm sure many people working corporate can relate to - though now working at a smaller company, I feel like the problem remains largely the same), and from the lack of fresh air and/or human interaction during that time (I'm an outgoing person and I crave human interactions but at my previous jobs, the interaction was literally three sentences exchanged at the watercooler a day; now at this new job, it's the same thing - the guys I'm seated with in the room literally don't say _a word_ apart from \"Hi\" and \"Bye\" the whole 8 hours - and believe me I've tried to have them talking but having felt like I was conducting an interview again and again, I just stopped pushing). Also, I'm so appalled by any digital media after sitting 8hrs in front of a screen that the things I would normally do to unwind (watch YouTube, watch a movie, play games) are completely off the table as my eyes are dead and I can't even focus on those things. I feel both physically and mentally done and it takes me a good two hours to be able to do any focused, quality activity for the remaining two. \n\nIn my previous jobs, this escalated so much that I'd gained like 15kgs over my year of working there, neglected basically all my hobbies and hated every hour of my life both on the week days (because of having no quality time outside of work) and on the weekends (because I wanted to cram so many things that I wasn't able to do during the week over those 48hrs that I was constantly stressed and frustrated that I could not). I did learn some lessons from that job and applied them now (like preparing meals in advance, forcing myself to sleep right etc) but honestly, the effect of those seems pretty negligible in the big picture.\n\nSo now I feel like I'm starting to fall into the same cycle again and I don't want to allow it to spiral as much as the last time. How do people still have a life while working full time? Having hobbies, friends and relationships, running freaking marathons? I do have all those things but am never able to sustain them when working full time. Even now I can see that my running schedule starts to fall apart again, I'm playing instruments 1 day a week instead of the usual 6 and so on. Despite rigorously sleeping 7h+ nights now, still the thing I'd love to do the most is just go and have a nap (which I'm forcing myself not to as it disregulates night sleep afterwards when done that late in the day). Is it the nature of working in CS and if you're not temperamentally compatible with being silent and alone for 95% of the day then you're not going to fit in? What am I doing wrong? Do you have any tips, personal accounts?",

I've recently (last 5-6 months) gained a significant interest in programming which began with a intro to data science course I took last fall. I am currently in school for a bachelors in Psych with a minor in Computer science.  I feel like that might not be enough especially since applying for software engineering internships has been rough to say the least. \n\nShould I consider applying for a masters in csc or data science? Im not too keen on working in the data science field due to many subreddits stating that many data science jobs today are not at all like the cool stuff you learn in school, also that many of these \"data science\" jobs are really more like data analytics and things of that sort. Machine Learning does seem very interesting but I am not sure if that field is dealing with the same things I have read online with data science. Can ML engineer be a similar work environment/field as a software engineer (assuming you work at similar tech companies). Idk much all I know is that I feel more challenged and more satisfied when I work on my csc projects.

I intend on doing an accelerated program where I get my bachelors degree in computer science and masters degree in software engineering within 5 years. My bachelors tuition is practically completely covered with a full tuition scholarship, I am a commuter so I do not pay room and board, and my masters will hopefully be covered with a graduate assistantship of some sort. Therefore, I will likely be debt free by the end of my education.\n\nThat puts me in a great position of not being in any debt out of college with a bachelors and masters, as I also have fully financed a car that will hopefully last me the next 8-10 years. Therefore, the next step would be to move out of my parents' home and find somewhere to live. For years, my dream has actually been to live \"up in the sky\" in a highrise in a beautiful city, and many of the top tech cities in the country are ludicrously expensive to the point that software engineers may not be able to afford to live in them. Something that has been heavily weighing on my mind is the fact that I ultimately hope to move to Miami, Florida, in a high-rise condo (not apartment) ranging from $2000-$3000 per month, but from my research, it appears as if Miami is not a big tech city and the engineers/developers do not get paid as much as engineers in, say, the west coast. I'm at a loss because living in the west coast in a highrise in a city is nearly double or triple the cost of doing the same on the east coast, but the salaries are much higher over there. I'm unsure if this dream is unrealistic in my 20's, but I want to do anything I can to set myself up to make it happen. I've lived in a crammed house my entire life, and the idea of living in a cozy condo with beautiful views is peaceful to me. Additionally, I am in a relatively long-term relationship, and my girlfriend is on-board with the plan and going to school for registered nursing, however I am unsure if it would be wise to finance the condo together rather than pay for it myself.

However, my national guard unit got surprised with a deployment that's going to be from Oct 2021 to around September of 2022. This means I won't be able to start PT school until Jan of 2023.  I will be honest and say it does have me down in the dumps since I applied specifically after being told this deployment wouldn't happen but now it is. \n\nNow since I will be spending a year in Kuwait doing basically nothing (and will have internet access most likely) I have been looking at what I can do to not make that year a waste of time. Looking at CS vs PT I noticed how much more upward mobility and flexibility there is in the CS career field compared to PT. Also not to mention not having to go to PT school for 3 years which means no income at all and maybe some debt even with the military paying for schooling. \n\nI have always liked computers and have built many systems, but I have zero experience with code. If I applied myself over the course of a year would I be able to become proficient enough in the an area of CS to possibly switch career fields and work my way up from an entry level position in the future? If so what path should I take to go from learning to applying what I learned to looking for a job? And of course is it even a good idea to think about changing careers when I have an acceptance letter in hand to PT?\n\nAny input is appreciated. Thanks everyone",

I have to choose my major 2 or 3 months later.\n\nIn advance, sorry for not sufficient knowledge on technical domains and the Reddit platform. This is my first post on it.\n\nMy interest includes robotics algorithms (mapping, localization, motion planning, and so on), computer vision, machine learning, low-level programming, autonomous driving systems. I would like to work in the robotics industry as a software engineer or research engineer. To get job opportunities in these competitive areas, I plan to get a Master's degree or Ph.D. in a related area. I recently have got an internship (almost equals to a part-time job) as a computer vision engineer, which attracts me so much. So, I am eager to get deeper into these areas.\n\nBecause of my broad interest and probably vague understanding of these domains, however, I have trouble with deciding whether I will major in Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science.\n\nThe same kinds of questions are already posted, but courses of CS and ME are a little bit different from ones in general. For your better understanding of my situation, I give a brief explanation about departments in my university.\n\nThe department of Mechanical Engineering in the university where I learn provides so many courses about mechanics (heat, fluid, material, mechanisms), control (classical & modern), and mechanical designs based on CAD, but not enough ones about robotics software, especially about the algorithm area. In lab classes, they deal with more heat systems like engines, less intelligent robots, deep learning, or software (not zero).\n\nThe department of Computer Science provides a deep understanding of computer systems, algorithms, low-level programming, machine learning, compiler, and logic. Especially, since I like low-level programming and computer system, these kinds of classes strongly attract me. However, they learn nothing about engineering concepts such as control, signal processing, and robotics algorithms. In addition, they learn mathematics from so theoretical point of view, which does not seem to fit me. I like math, especially optimization and geometry, but classes like \"definition -> proof -> definition -> proof -> ...\" are boring for me. Historically, CS in my university derived from Math and belongs to the School of Science, not to the School of Engineering, so it is natural that professors studying pure discrete mathematics and pure logic in CS. In my view, though a CS degree is said to be good for jobs related to software, it is not necessarily true for robotics software.\n\nIn summary, it is a problem like \"Hardware side with so much mechanics and design or Software side with computer systems and a little bit too theoretical mathematics\".\n\nI hope to get some advice from those who are related to the robotics industry or academia.\n\nThanks for reading and answering, in advance.",

These would be greenfield applications.  First company is a small bank.  It is a small organization and they are using all the latest tech.  I think the learning security part would be cool as well, but worried about the work potentially becoming routine after a couple of years.  Second is a consulting company.  It would be a salaried position - B2B job, where the company contracts with a larger organization, goes onsite with the consulting companies staff members, spins up the project from the entire lifecycle and leaves.  The contracts would usually take  6 months to a few years to complete.  Both are backend heavy.    \n\nI'm leaning towards consulting mostly because of the variety.  Wondering if there were pros/cons of either in these types of jobs (or maybe it would be too company specific for an opinion).",

During that time I had a bunch of managers, but my last one hated me from the get-go for some reason and my life a living hell. Right before the pandemic he called me all sorts of names, I went to his skip level, huge mess. I was ready to get out, and then the pandemic hit and suddenly jobs were hard to come by.\n\nThen with the pandemic the company laid off 1/2 of their staff and it ruined what was left of the culture. Nobody trusted each other, everyone talked shit behind everyone's back, micromanagement, people constantly getting yelled at, coworkers that were friends turning on each other. It basically got to the point where I opened my laptop and wondered \"how am I going to get yelled at today?\"\n\nLong story short, I left that nightmare and started a new remote job. People from my old job are stalking my LinkedIn. I even had someone who still works there who I once considered a friend email me, tell me my boss talked shit on me for over 2 years in 1 on 1's (and still does), and that I was replaced by my boss's friend. I don't need old gossip in my life (and not sure what the point is to even rub my nose in this shit), so needless to say we don't speak anymore.\n\nSo long story short, after years of emotional abuse in the workplace I am having a bit of a hard time trusting my new coworkers. I keep waiting for my new boss to jump down my throat, or my coworkers to gossip about me, even though there's no inclination that either will happen. After years of passive aggressive code reviews, I'm trying not to project that tone on new people, but I can't help it. \n\nOther than good old therapy, do you have any work-place related tips on how to mentally \"start fresh\" with a new group of people?

        "body": "Warning: Long Wall(s) of text\n\nI'll start by describing where I am now: I have 5 years experience. I have agreed via email to take a new job and have been sent the final contract to sign. I was sent the final contract yesterday. I have not signed it.\n\nNow, for a lot of background: Last September I was in the interview process with this same company. It is quite a big company, probably top 5 in my country (Asian). I initially reached out to them to apply. I got the offer, however, I turned them down because the salary increase wasn't really that much for jumping jobs, about a 20% increase. I do like my current job (100% WFH, this new one is not) so it wasn't worth it.\n\nSoon after I turned them down, my project at my current job ended due to unforeseen reasons. So in December I reached out to them and asked if the role was still available, they said no, but they will let me know next spring if/when they have openings. So they did. I got an email in March. By  this time I still didn't actually have a project at work, basically having done nothing for 5 months. So I said yes. I tried to negotiate a few things with them but they would not budge on anything--no extra vacation days, not a single extra dollar in salary. Nothing. But whatever, I really wanted this job. I went through 1 more in-person interview with them. They did wonder why I was interested in the job again since I initially turned them down and I just told them the truth.\n\nThings took some time, and I finally agreed to the official offer letter in mid April. \\*\\*2 big differences\\*\\* comparing this offer and the one from last year--this is a 2 year contract offer, and last year's was permanent employment. This one also gives me a 28% raise compared to 20% last time. I wasn't thrilled about just a 2 yr contract, but well whatever.\n\n Then holy shit, literally the day I was set to tell my current job that I will be leaving at the end of May--I got a raise. Out of nowhere. I never asked for it or hinted to anyone. A 25% raise. When I got the initial email from my director, I thought I was getting fired. Now the 2 salaries are nearly identical--just a 3% difference between them. I did not tell the new job though, because I didn't want them to feel like I was stringing them along, especially since I turned down their offer last year. Then \\*after\\* that, \\*I\\* reached back out to them. So I said to myself, \"ok fine. You really have to just accept this. Very bad timing, but that's life. Stay true to your word, you accepted so it's the right thing to do.\" So I told my current job I will be resigning at the end of May, and I refused their raise. Now our 2 companies HRs are talking to get all visa stuff worked out for visa transfer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo then yesterday I finally got the final contract. And there are some things that are different, or were not included in the initial offer. For example, there is no mention of my bonus. Also the contract states that employees are not allowed to discuss salaries with anyone besides management. And it says something I (unfortunately) overlooked initially--the company can, at their sole discretion, extend the probation period indefinitely. It also states (not included in original contract) that in the event of termination, they can give me payment in lieu of advance notice. This is pretty bad for me because I am an international employee, so if I get fired my visa expires and I have 1 week maximum to pack all my stuff and leave the country--a country where I have mostly built my life the last 5 years.\n\nSo honestly at this point I just feel like this company is extremely stiff and rigid. In our first round of salary negotiations last year, they refused to budge at all. Then again during March they also refused to grant me a single thing I requested--they just said \"XYZ is standard for our international employees, we can't change it.\" It really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. And now, finally I get the final contract and my bonus is written out. I requested that they remove  their ability to extend the probation period, and they once again said they cannot remove that language, it is standard in all contracts.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from just refusing to sign is I want to keep my reputation. I feel like going back on them a 2nd time will destroy my local reputation and recruiters that they or others may know will think badly of me, and news will get around. Other than that, honestly, a 3% salary raise is not at all worth all this hassle. \n\nShould I try to stay at my current job (I am about 90% sure they would let me stay), or just suck up the missteps I've already made? Thanks for reading until the end.",

Just for context, I'm a man and come from an ethnic minority, outside the US.\n\nI started programming shortly after College around 7 years ago, doing Java during my first job. Projects were boring all the time (desktop apps), and I was interested in doing web dev, so I decided to apply to a Frontend position and got hired in 2015 in a digital agency, where I've had the chance to work on a variety of projects using several of the most popular JS frameworks. It was there where I really learned the software development cycle, versioning, testing, among other stuff.\n\nThe first two years I used to engage in long learning curves whenever I started a new project (we do mostly outsourced maintenance of existing projects). I would spend hours reading documentation, testing, googling, and debugging during ramp-up phases. And I kinda hoped this curve would get shorter with time as I got more experienced. But the truth is that it never did.\n\nBecause of how diverse and complex FE projects can be technology-wise, every time that I have to switch to a new team or project, I feel like I am starting from scratch. Like day 1. There can be a new framework with hundreds of new dependencies that I've never seen in my life or a strange integration of js libraries that somehow somebody managed to put together to build a set of web forms that could've been easily implemented in a different approach.\n\nAnd it's so frustrating because I have to be asking tons of questions all the time, onboarding sessions are never enough and mentorship is nonexistent most of the time. I get stuck easily and it takes me forever to catch up. At a personal level, it makes me feel constantly incompetent and forever inexperienced until eventually, I manage to fully understand everything.\n\nI know code maintenance can be hell. And I know every project and every company is different. But in my case, I haven't had the luck to grow as much as I wanted during these years as a FE developer. Maybe maintenance doesn't make you grow as much. Maybe FE is actually a huge mess. Or maybe I have the wrong impression of how experience translates into learning curve times. But the truth is that it can be very overwhelming.\n\nHas anybody here gone through something similar?\n\nAny tips to speed up learning curves?\n\nThank you",

It's essentially my dream job because I get to work on something that I've been using for a couple of years now, but I'm feeling dumb and it's taking a toll on me mentally.\n\nI'm aware of imposter syndrome, and know that everyone experiences it.

Some days I look at code and literally freeze up because I don't even know where to begin. \n\nMy coworkers are all really friendly, so it isn't a case of them showing toxic behavior like \"you should know this\" or anything like that (no matter how many times I create the scenario in my head that it secretly is). In fact, they've told me they like some of the ideas that I've implemented into our product to improve the user experience. \n\nHow do I get myself out of this mental state and fix this?

Working with senior dev who drives good engineers away and management has no intention to address it. Should I quit and focus on my mental health and interviewing? Or will that hurt my second job hunt a lot \ud83e\udd14 \n\nHi all. I\u2019ve been in my first engineering job for about 10 months and I\u2019ve been seriously contemplating quitting for about a month. It started off as a good experience because I had a great senior engineer mentor on my team but once she left I realized that she shielded me from working with the senior developer who everyone dislikes. She left during a reorg where both my supportive manager and coworkers that I like got moved to a different team and I was left working with people who are all doing their own things. The senior developer is the only one I get to work with and his code is bad, the whole team depends on him, and I got stuck doing shit work for months (moving an app to production) so I basically just spend all day trying to get his code to run on my computer and he\u2019s constantly changing it so I have to constantly meet with him. All of the code stuff I\u2019m doing is shitty configuration stuff and it\u2019s never ending. I\u2019m not learning or building and everyday I have to say \u201cstill working on the same thing\u201d in scrum. The senior dev is not friendly, very condescending, mansplained the terminal to me, and basically just does what he wants since he\u2019s been here forever. Adding on to all of that, I started my first job during the pandemic and throughout everything that\u2019s been going on with BLM, Stop asian hate, etc. no one on my team talks about what\u2019s going on. Add on to that that I\u2019m the only woman of color on a team of 20 men and I\u2019ve started hating and resenting my job to the point where I have crying breakdowns everyday. I\u2019ve also expressed my frustrations to my manager months ago and asked to get put on a different project but nothing has happened. I hate the company culture and a bunch of people have left my team as well. I\u2019ve given up on pushing for change here and I\u2019ve started job hunting. I\u2019m trying to hold out longer but part of me is wondering if I should just quit and focus on my mental health and interviewing. I have about 3-4 months of savings saved up as well. I\u2019m mostly concerned about losing negotiating power or having to job hunt/explain my situation in interviews. I\u2019m also concerned about not having my first job tenure be a whole year & the idea of potentially not finding a job for months. Any thoughts? I\u2019m trying to hold out but my mental health is worse than it\u2019s ever been. \n\nAdvice would be much appreciated especially from people who have found a second eng job during Covid!",

They all typical work 32 hours over 4 days, no call, rare emergency overtime, and seem to get more desirable with age.\n\nThe cs folks I work with over 40 tend to take 2 paths. The lucky successful ones (10% of people or less) get m7 mbas and move into the upper echelons, making great money with terrible hours. The remaining 90% of people on my path tend to settle into middle management, face lay offs, lack autonomy, face wage stagnation, and generally seem unhappy.\n\nI applied to a competitive pre dental program with over 90% acceptance rate to dental schools but I'm getting cold feet as everyone I know is telling me it's not worth it (5 years long, 300k tuition plus lost wage). I'm also worried in the future dentistry will go cities l corporate and I'll be a slave to production.\n\nAm I wrong in thinking ageism will hurt me in my current career without a masters degree? Am I looking at dentistry with rose tinted glasses? Any older math/cs folks regret staying in the career after 40?",

I like money.\n\n2. Fashion isn't exciting and there's no room for meaningful innovation. Besides which consumers are simply not interested in fashion, like yeah sure everyone wants a Louis Vuitton or whatever but there's no value for craftsmanship or design, only 'hype'. The pandemic has forced the industry into an existential crisis and it seems like a sinking ship to me.\n\n3. I want to be part of a meaningful community that doesn't have its head up it's a\\*\\*, tech/coding/UX/UI seems like a nice bunch of people... but I don't know that yet.\n\n5. I don't want to live in NY/Cali.\n\nI know people keep saying it's a trendy field and everyone is career-hopping into it but nonetheless, I have a few questions:\n\n\n1. Is it worth it? Will it stay relevant? Is the money good? Is the work culture good (or at least not as toxic as fashion)?\n\n2. Do I need another degree? I would rather not get another degree or Bootcamp. I'd rather be self-taught or a certificate. Is that a legitimate route to go or will I be wasting my time?\n\n3. Are there any transferable skills between Fashion Design and software? I can make tech packs and spec sheets, 3D model a dress, draft patterns and textile prints, cut and sew a garment and photograph to sell.. but how do these skills transfer to something like software development? \n\n4. What does it take to get a well-paying job? The people I know in software keep boasting about 110k straight out of college, now that's rare obliviously, what kind of starting salary is reasonable and how does it scale with experience?",

        "body": "Hey everyone. I'm a (formerly) lead developer based in the Rust Belt. Have about 12 years experience, skill wise I have had my hands all over the place. My last company went belly up due to the pandemic and earlier this year I started interviewing.\n\nWith remote jobs popping off, a whole new world was opened up for me with job opportunities. I got 5 offers since January. Some gave me close or near my low Rust Belt salary, or the benefits weren't great so I turned them down. Then I got an offer from a mid sized West Coast company (remote).\n\nThe job was for a mid level developer role and their salary was amazing for me, so I took it. But then I took the job and found out that the job itself is way beneath me skills wise.... and I haven't even wrote a single line of code in the 2 months I've been there. So here are my pros and cons:\n\nCons:\n\n- Haven't wrote any code, worried I will stagnate skills wise over time.\n\n- They mislead me, so not exactly hyped about that\n\n- Company is going through a transitionary period, a good number of people have left and been backfilled\n\nPros:\n\n- Pay is WAY more than I can get locally. For reference my friend works in my city as a senior dev and gets $40k less than I do for a tough dev job, while I tweak XML files and other easy stuff. Pay is also more than I got with other remote offers\n\n- Great benefits (unlimited PTO with 20 days minimum encouraged, employee perks, don't have to commute)\n\n- I like my coworkers and they like me\n\n- Low stress. No micromanagement, no one cares what schedule you work, job is a breeze, no panic attacks come deadline time. And best of all, NO DAILY STANDUPS OR SCRUM SHIT!!!\n\nSo I am thinking about just sticking it out for a year. After all the mental stress put on by the pandemic, I feel like I could use a year to work a low stress job and remove myself from the rat race, at least for awhile. However, I am worried that I will stagnate and not interview well in a year. I have no problem getting offers now, and I figure that down the line I can work on my Github and stuff again and get back up to speed.\n\nWhat do you think? Is it worth the risk this far into my career?",

I have zero experience in the entire field, I have zero experience in tech in general.  I used to be a chef for a living. I was hired after I finished a coding bootcamp. \n\nThis is my first tech job and the company is aware of this. I have had 6 1on1s with my boss but I feel like I'm not asking the appropriate questions. He hasn't mentioned anything about it but I feel like I'm going to be expected to ask the job related questions now but I fear I still don't really know what it is I'm supposed to be doing. I was told to learn the test automation and be able to do the automation for when we do production release and I've attempted it but I always end up making the test fail and communication with the people in charge of this hasn't really been available and to boot, i think one of the two is on vacation or sick leave at the moment. I'm expected to do a run next Friday.\n\nI've been tasked to learn and I update on my learning. I went to a bootcamp and learned the MERN stack but this company deals with their own proprietary stack so every time I try to learn something I just say .. \"well I learned this and I can see the similarity of this with what is being used in our codebase\" and it seems to be a reasonable explanation to my inability to understand the code thoroughly but I don't know how much longer I can explain that way. \n\nI feel like there's  not much mentorship but I don't know if a month and a half is what they expect to be enough to start on asking more work specific questions and not finding similarities on what I was learning and the codebase that exists already.\n\nSo to my question, what sort of questions can I ask my manager to communicate that I want to be able to understand the codebase but I need some more guidance than what I am receiving now? Basically like 1 to 2 people talking to me a per week and tell me to update my access requests and they will connect with me again later when that's done. When I do get pass that they are busy and can't talk to me again and I'm just left to watching pluralsight videos all day. I'm not complaining, I just feel like I'm still not really learning what I need to learn specifically related to the job and that they will think I will not be good enough for this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the rant.

Other time I managed to complete the assigment and build a Springboot backend but the company replied that I didn't do the requirements that wasn't listed in their task. \n\nPerhaps I wasn't exactly dedicated to the programming as my peers were, since I was also busy with my second hobby? \n\nPrevious semester I've had to take 7 classes (In Lithuania you can't select how many classes per semester you should take) so I didn't have time to built my portfolio though I have college assignments in github but I don't think that's enough. \n\nCurrently I just feel hopelessness and tired. Though I will be applying to more companies before I would have to take an academic leave perhaps then I would have time to make portfolio.\n\nSo far I applied in LinkedIn, Glassdoor and other lithuanian websites that dedicated for internships. \n\nI would like to hear suggestions on where else I could apply to and what else I could work on.\n\nI'd be happy to get an internship that will be accepted by college even the internship will be unpaid and have to learn new language.",

What I realized is that regardless of funding, it does not stop them from having the most unpredictable hiring practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne startup promised me they would consider me for fully remote and that location is not issue for them.  Well, the boomer cofounders decided that they will not be a WFH company, and that they want people in the office at least 4 days a week in the Bay Area.  I decided no thanks, and withdrew my application.\n\n\n\n\n\n6 months ago, I applied for a backend engineering position at one startup.  The recruiter interview went well, then started talking with the hiring manager.  He literally told me that he has zero intention of hiring me for the role in the first minute of the interview, and asked me if I would be willing to interview with them a few months into the future when data-related roles open up.  6 months later, the only job postings this company has is a few account manager jobs.\n\n\n\n\nAnother startup had a lengthy technical interview process.  I did great, but they rejected me because of \"lack of fit\".  Whatever that means, but I typically do well with other companies that have more behavioral interviews.\n\n\n\nWith these hiring practices, it seems like startups will never be able to compete with bigger companies in terms of hiring talent.  There is a lot of people who are willing to work at startups if it meant not doing hundreds of leetcode problems.  I personally would take a very small paycut at my next job if this was possible and if I could work on interesting projects.\n\n\n\n\nStartups with old-fashioned views of WFH will never attract quality engineers if they can't offer WFH to their engineers when they are paying below market value.\n\n\n\n\n\nStartups have the opportunity to attract a lot of talent, but their hiring practices prevent it.",

Chances are I'll also be restricted to academia and its salaries.  I'll be making ~60k for the next 3 years and will probably be looking at 150k-200k in 4-5 years, then low 200s several years after that.   Certainly not something to scoff at, but also not the \"doctor money\" some people expect.  Medicine also comes with insurance that will cut into my salary.\n\nI have become increasingly interested in technology and computer programming over the past 5 years.  So much so that I'm considering leaving to become a software engineer.\n\nWould this be absolutely insane?  It wouldn't take much to beat my work satisfaction right now and I already sit in front of a computer all day.\n\nI think my main concerns about making the switch are my ability to make a salary in the same ballpark while having similar benefits (4-6 weeks paid vacation, health insurance) and not being too late to the game to be able to succeed and move up the career ladder.  I'm in my early 30s.\n\nConcerns about staying in medicine are my relative lack of opportunities, the need to move several times in the next several years, and the fact that I just don't like it all that much anymore.

So, I was able to obtain a scholarship and started my degree program in 2019 and have recently graduated debt-free (with some obligations, but not to the employer). While obtaining the degree, I also worked part-time for the same company doing dev work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent situation:\n\nAfter graduation, my employer offered me just above $17/hr which I felt was a huge slap in the face. I countered with a substantial amount higher than what they offered (around \\~$33/hr) noting my near four years of experience in software with them and my new degree. The senior dev has given me high praises and says the quality of code I produce is better than he's seen from other senior devs.\n\nMy employer countered back saying my hours clocked only amounted to about 2.5 years experience so they were still considering me a junior dev thus the low-ball salary. I really feel blindsided as I've been really loyal to this company and have put in huge amounts of time and effort into improving my skills and continuing to work for them even while going to school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestion:  \nWith my situation, do you think its fair for them to go based off of hours clocked and not consider the calendar years I've worked there as experience? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reply and I'll try my best to answer them.",

But my actual skills aren't as honed as they could be.

I come to you all in need of some feedback and advice in regards to what you believe I may have been doing wrong in my job search process. I graduated last year in August, and have been looking for jobs since September.\n\nFortunately, I was able to secure a few interviews in which I felt that I did well as an Entry Level candidate however, after a few days of each of them, I would wake up to rejection emails suggesting that I did not have enough work experience or, an email directly from the interviewer suggesting that they found a candidate who had at least 1-2 years of experience more than me. \n\nI did two internships during the summer after my sophomore and junior year (2nd went on for 6 months until Covid hit and I got laid off - FML) however, they had a hiring freeze throughout 2020 and I received a rejection that went along the lines of the context I mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\nThroughout the past few months, I've just been depressed after receiving countless rejections, however, I did prepare myself for it, as the times are very difficult due to covid, but the impact of rejections was inevitable as it took a toll on my mental health. \n\nThis past week, I gathered myself and have been putting in the maximum effort towards job search in hopes of success. I have been working in a startup part-time to maintain my visa status as I am an international student which I feel has provided me some valuable experience that I can now bring into my resume. \n\nYesterday, I was considering exploring different paths/fields with my Computer Science knowledge and experience such as Salesforce Development and Data Analysis but I am a little misguided in regards to them and would appreciate any guidance that anyone may have.\n\nI would also be grateful if you had any feedback or recommendations in regards to how I should up my game in job search and practicing interview questions on leetcode. I am a small Liberal Arts College grad who's looking for any sort of opportunity. Harsh feedback is welcome as well.

I also get excellent benefits and healthcare. This offer sounds great except for the fact that it is a rotational program and it requires me to relocated to Kennesaw, GA first and then Charlotte, NC or Seattle, WA. The job is an application development in C++ and C#, or implement REST based APIs in a service-based architecture. This doesn\u2019t sound bad, but I currently work as a software engineer/(mobile developer) at a small company in Tampa, FL. I love my current job because I get to work as the main mobile developer/engineer which it amazing giving that is my first job and mobile development is the field that I always wanted to be in since before graduating from college. This job gives me a lot of freedom, so much that for the past 4 months I been working remotely from Puerto Rico and my boss is pretty easy going with how I organize my daily work schedule. Unfortunately, my currently salary is below average even for a job located in FL. My salary is 55k, but I have been living very comfortably because I don\u2019t need to pay rent in Puerto Rico and the cost of living here is significantly lower than in Tampa, FL. My dilemma is, should I take this new job offer and leave my current job? I made a cost analysis of all the expenses I would inquire if I accept this new job offer and my net gains after all expenses is only like $400 more than what I\u2019m currently making/saving on a monthly basis. All my family and friends are either in Puerto Rico or Tampa so GA would be apart from all of them and I not sure the extra money is worth moving apart from all of them, but I don\u2019t know if I should let this opportunity slip away since the salary is so high. Should I mention the offer to my current employer and ask if they would at least give me a 10k increase on my salary? I have only been working for my current employer for four months so I\u2019m relatively new. Also, is me not taking this job offer limiting my chances of getting an even higher salary in the future? Should I stick to mobile development if I'm enjoying it so much? What is the best course of action for someone in my position?",

The TC is pretty good for a Canadian new grad position and it is a company I would enjoy working for and has good learning and growth opportunities. \n\nHowever, the TC does not compare to that of high tier US tech companies, and is also less than that which the US offices for this company offers. I know people say cost-of-living is different but the Canadian office is located in one of the most expensive cities in North America (and I'm also 'meh' about the prospect of living there). Furthermore, I still have 1 year left before graduation and still have 1 more internship left to complete as part of my degree so I'm still quite ambitious on aiming for a better offer at a higher tier company -- which I believe is achievable given my recent internship experience at the company who gave me the FT offer.\n\nSo my question to ya'll is, would you simply decline the offer (the ethical choice) or accept the offer with the intent of reneging if something better comes along in that year before graduating? \n\nP.S.

I've been feeling very much like I needed to go elsewhere for a while but I haven't had a good push as the job pays OK and offers great benefits (but with 0 upward mobility).\n\nHowever, last week I had a medical incident and at this point I'm not sure if I'll be able to safely drive as much (if at all), even going up and down stairs can be a challenge. I'm on medical leave from work while waiting on specialists and referrals etc. but I'm coming from an IT job that involved a large amount of walking. And work from home would be challenging as we already have a help desk that handles most remote issues (management already decided to not let people WFH as there was fear of just downsizing and outsourcing everyone).\n\nI realized that it'd be much better for me in the long term to switch to a career that allows more work from home/flexibility and could hopefully offer much better pay - right now with my current job I don't see myself having a long term career/retirement plan, and until I hear from my doctors I'm stuck on medical leave wondering if I'll even be able to go back to my job.\n\nI've been looking into coding bootcamps (as I'd rather not spend 4 years in school racking up tons of debt), but a lot seem really sketchy. The one I see most advertised/recommended is App Authority, but there's literally no way to schedule a talk with admissions (which seems really suspicious). They claim you pay nothing upfront until you \"find a job\" making $50k+, but they don't specify that it's a software engineer job. My current job I make a little over $50k, so it would be nice to avoid paying large sums while at a job I may or may not be able to go back to at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** I'm in my late 30s, may or may not be disabled/unable to walk/drive reliably, and want to break into software engineering/half-stack/full-stack.

The pay would be $50/hour, and is about 30% more than I make now. I want to take it, but my gut is telling me no. \n\nTo start off, I think the firm outsourced to India which isn't bad, but the recruiter or HR rep don't understand verbal english. So phone conversations go nowhere. The second red flag was when the recruiter lied about me getting the position and started asking for my social. I reached out straight to my interviewer and he said he didn't make a decision yet. Also when I asked the recruiter if I'd have insurance, can take time off, he said yes to all of it. Yet the paperwork from HR listed my position as a computer programmer (all docusign btw, no workday for onboarding) without insurance. \n\nI told them when I have proof from Walmart I got the position I'll fill out the paperwork. Finally this week a person who is english proficient reached out and sent an email screenshot of Walmart confirming to move forward with me. I reached out to the interviewer from Walmart to discuss long term career expectations to make sure this purely a 6 month contract and we chat tomorrow. \n\nSo I feel trapped between a rock and a hard place.

        "body": "Hello,\n\nFirst Reddit post in a long time!\n\nStory time: I am an engineering student, I have an associates in manufacturing engineering. Currently going for my bachelors. I have been a machinist for 5 years, minus 6 months where I was a tooling engineer before being demoted due to the pandemic. Shortly after I followed a coworker to a different company as it was made clear that my engineering position was being eliminated even after business picked up.\n\nI recently was reached out to by a friend who's small shop was looking for another manufacturing engineer. The place offered me the position with no raise (I am paid very well for a machinist, I produce excellent results), and the benefits are not as good seeing as it is a much smaller shop then the one I work at. However, the way I see it is that engineering experience will help my engineering career in the long run compared to more machining experience. (It's not really a field that can be peaked, but I feel like anything else I learn would only be useful if I stayed being a machinist).\n\nSo with that job offer in hand, I gave my notice at my current job. Immediately upon doing so I was told to talk to the plant manager and explain the situation. I did so, while explaining that the company had treated me excellently, and that I was not leaving due to an increase in pay but rather more suitable work experience.\n\nI was made a counter offer which will be given to me in writing on monday that states something to the following effect: I will become an associate manufacturing engineer, the company will reimburse the next 2 years of my tuition and upon completion I will be promoted to manufacturing engineer. However the duties of associate manufacturing engineer will not start for a few months while they free someone up to operate my machines.\n\nIn the machining/manufacturing world, it's completely normal for things to take a bit because skilled labor is hard to come by (especially now, given the current job market). I also did not find any reason to doubt the legitimacy of his want for me to fill this position. There is a lifetime employee/engineer retiring in a year or 2, and the other engineers have purchased tooling that has made me want to bang my head into a wall, causing real issues in the shop. I was a tooling engineer at one point, so there have been times I have told them things weren't going to work before even producing parts. (so far, I've won that argument every time after they try it anyways.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my question with that all out of the way is: should I consider the counter offer? I have always heard they are bad to accept. However I do enjoy my current company, I just want to start my engineering career and start to leave my machining one behind. If I were to accept the counter offer, what sorts of things should I look for in the written offer to be safe?",

I am in Canada btw. \n\nI guess since I have wasted so much time already I am afraid of choosing the wrong path and wasting even more time.

My original intention was to continue on to do my Phd in computer science, but due to some personal and professional reasons I won't be going into a Phd program immediately, or even for a few years.\n\nMy master's was focused on cryptography, and I managed to publish a few papers in good venues. My problem is that my work was theoretical, (think mostly math) so I don't necessarily have as much applied knowledge as my peers. I also didn't hold any relevant internships (I know, bad decision) and instead opted to do research over the summer.\n\nI was thinking of trying to get into cybersecurity, since it is closely related to what I have done. I am looking at grinding out a Comptia a+ certification and applying for IT technician roles, then transitioning to cybersecurity, but to be honest the pay seems a bit underwhelming. \n\nAre there any other career paths which I have overlooked which would fit my skills? \nWhat other certifications/skills should I be looking at to make myself more appealing?\n\nI appreciate you taking the time to read this and respond, thank you.",

        "body": "As an introduction, I'm a senior at a top 50 school double majoring cs + economics (biggest regret tbh). I was a junior last year doing well having had done 10+ APs for some credit, national merit finalist in hs etc so generally good student and was doing well but then covid struck and we all got kicked out of housing (avoiding personal info) I went without access to internet and was forced to move into an environment I avoided for years. I became incredibly depressed and basically couldn't be bothered to finish my classes even though I basically just had to open and take the final ( I was so miserable and shameful of myself I thought I deserved to fail even if I could pass). I failed 3 classes just from avoidance and got withdrawn from the university and on top of that I went through a breakup and that was the cherry on top.\n\nI appealed late in the summer when I felt a bit better and I thought I couldn't tell anyone that that happened and they luckily let me back in. I miraculously went back and my financial aid was miraculously given back as well at the sympathy of a counselor. I started to feel better around the fall, and somehow luckily I got a job around December at a very reputable company for xx engineering with a great program. The thing is the mental health issues left me barely scraping by as I wasn't properly able to be productive and got basically all D's in all my classes which was fine for graduating I suppose, but I'm nearing the end of spring semester and the classes I have exams for I could cram and take, but my very very last cs class in circuitry was asynchronous and I basically didn't even look at it doing half the assignments, missed all quizzes and lab attendance grade, and the final is in a week. I'm confident in my ability to do well on the final tbh, but even then it looks like I won't be able to pass the class.\n\nMy job is set to start in mid June, and I don't think I'll ever be lucky enough to receive an offer as amazing as this job in the current job climate and in general. It's basically 100k salary w amazing benefits and opportunities at a top 50 company. I can't take this class in the summer as it's not offered either. I emailed the professor recently and he said he's a little sympathetic but unless I get a doctor's note for some assignments, he is being strict with all his deadlines and giving 0's a minute late grading policy. I really don't know what to do and I've heard of people taking jobs and not saying anything which tbh seems possible in this case, but I also am afraid of the risks of that backfiring and sorta disappointed having done the work for 2 majors and not getting a degree. I really haven't told anyone about this as my peers are so happy for me, but graduation is in a few weeks (luckily optional so I don't have to tell family) and it's eating at me inside. Only in the last few weeks I've started to get my shit together from the support of a few incredible supportive people to recover my other classes but this one class seems unsalvageable.\n\nWhat should I even do? My friends family and relatives are all expecting me to graduate with this job. Should I just start the job and not look back? Or do I tell my company, lose the opportunity, and take another semester in the fall to graduate (if my university even lets me attend again after failing so many classes). It's so stupid that I did this to myself especially when looking back all I had to do was the bare minimum, but I also can't forget how debilitating the shame and depression that I went through lead me here. If I start my job too, I think I'm really confident that I will do really well. I have no idea what to do I just need to hear opinions.",

The way I see it, either I lie on the clearance and risk any penalty that would happen to me (I read the gov will reach out to all my friends and try to know me better than I know myself), OR I answer truthfully and my clearance is failed, and my company would probably see the reason I failed( that I have done lots of drugs, all the time), and that would be really embarrassing/possibly grounds for termination if they aren't ok with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, am I overreacting? What would you do in this situation? Should I tell my boss that I will fail? I signed up to be a developer, not james bond :(",

        "body": "I'm a recent graduate from a CS program in Canada looking to land my first full-time job in software development. My problem mainly stems from the fact that I feel that I don't really have the skills that most companies are looking for due to some off-kilter experience.\n\nAs for why that is: I actually did a dual degree in Computer Science and Engineering Physics (EP first, then started CS in 3rd year). This was partially because EP has few job prospects unless you're going into research or are gung-ho about space (which I am not), and partially because I wanted to get an internship through the CS department's internship program (which worked out, thankfully). Throughout these degrees, my accumulated experience amounts to 3 summers of research writing data analysis code for radar and satellite data (with 2 papers published with co-author credits) and a 16-month internship writing image analysis code for a university group that was half research group and half startup company (its weird). As for projects, I was focused on my classes, so my projects mainly stem from them: a Python simulator to recreate the results of a networking paper, a mechanical device for rotating tiny samples in a vacuum chamber (for the EP degree's final-year project), and other small things that recruiters likely wouldn't care about like a dead-simple stepper motor driver.\n\nAs a result, I don't seem to mesh well with most entry-level software development positions. I don't have any web-dev experience, whether front, back, or full-stack (despite the image analysis code being made for a web-app; I just didn't write much non-analysis stuff for the backend codebase, which was mostly Python, Django, and an abuse of ElasticSearch as a database). Embedded and IOT stuff seem interesting to me, but they seem to require hardcore C/C++ experience that I don't have plus a bunch of other weird skills that I've not have encountered before. Cloud and database stuff is also interesting, but they similarly have high requirements that I can't really meet. It seems that all I could really do is data analysis, but I'd much rather be a software developer and not be pigeonholed into just analysis, even with substantial coding involved.\n\nAnd so, I haven't applied to as many places as I should have so far. I've gotten 1 interview, but only because a friend of a friend (/my supervisor for my internship) gave me a referral to a popular local company with Master's level AI people also applying to it. I just don't know what positions I qualify for or should apply to. I don't know how I can convince recruiters and companies that I could easily learn and do embedded, or cloud, or web development with what is largely analysis experience. I don't know how I can spin my mish-mash of experience into a full-time software development position.\n\n(And, for posterity, [my current resume](https://imgur.com/a/TSLvJWt), though critiques are not the point of this post compared to the worries I mentioned above.)",

Felt frustrated during the process as I had many questions I cannot answer that were specific to my problem. My professor suggested I do an MS in CS with a focus on ML. Had to work right after grad because can't afford to enroll myself yet. During my working years, I met a really smart group of people who believed that an MS is a waste of time and money if you wanna work for businesses. These group had lots of connections which brought me lots of part time data science related gigs = $$$. With that money I've saved, I'm planning to study part time(I already applied and got accepted to the best uni that offers this degree in my country and under the ML lab of a great supervisor) and work full time. I can't quit my job because I need to support my family financially.\n\nI think I need more time in school aka MS degree because in my work as a data scientist for a startup, Ive been in situations where I failed to understand what to change in a ready made tool so it will work for my client's specific problem. These are open source tools for deep learning. I don't know if experience alone can fix this under the hood problem.\n\nI also did not understand the material perfectly well in theory classes back in college. I believe a formal training will sharpen my skills in reading ML papers and implement them to code. Plus, I got rejected from a machine learning research scientist position I applied because someone with an MS degree was preferred by the company. \n\nOther than that realization in my limitation of understanding, I don't know other possible motivations to get an MS in CS with ML focus degree. Hoping you could give my some guidance. Thank you. \n\n\n\nP. S\nI'm from a third world country where AI/ML is not yet booming.",

I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this way knowing how lucky I am to have a job and a company that has treated me well but oh well.  Over the past 2-3 months, I've started to feel very upset and angry at my work due to small little things adding up to a point I can't just ignore and I want to share with everyone to see if anyone else has experienced these. I feel like I'm being a soft azz beach but I just can't tell why it upsets me so much.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. In our team calls where we are discussing new features and details, I feel like I don't get the chance to say what I want to say. One senior starts talking about something, UX jumps in to point flaws and then it just becomes a back and forth back and forth between these two with others jumping in and cutting each other off to speak and I'm just not like that. Ill politely raise my hand and wait until my manager calls but because these guys keep going back and forth and my manager doesn't shut them up, it gets to the end of the meeting and I either forgot what I wanted to say or no more time and the meeting ends with my opinions and thoughts not expressed. Like there have been times I wanna unmute and just yell \"CAN EVERYONE PLEASE SHUT UP AND LET ME SPEAK!\" but that's obviously unprofessional and I hate cutting people off mid conversation to assert my point. It happened several times and I just feel like nobody gives a shit about what I need to say. The seniors dominate the conversation and UX guy can't just shut the up for a God damn second and keeps pushing back while I sit there politely waiting for my turn. At the beginning I just ignored it and said it's fine but it happened so much that now I just feel like crying and feel useless to the company cause nobody apparently cares about what I want to say. The couple times I have had the chance to express my views regardless how dumb they are, I appreciated just being acknowledged and being told that it's not a good idea or it's a great idea. I'm not always right but I literally just want to be acknowledged and heard when I have something.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. One time some guy from another team was having trouble with something he was working on and it was connected to something I worked on before. I help him troubleshoot and spend my entire day looking beyond our code and into the packages we are using (went beyond our codebase, a deeper rooted issue). Once I found out why, I was excited since it took me the whole damn day. He's much more senior than I am so I was really excited to report to him the problem. Once I did, he was just like \"oh that's wrong it shouldn't be like that\" end of conversation. No thank you, no appreciation for debugging for him, no F'ING NOTHING! I was so deflated cause I literally could have denied to help him but because he's much more senior and has way more experience, I felt rude rejecting his request although I had my own work.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n 3. Manager assigned me a feature that I should work on. I was super excited and he helped give me get started. I start digging into it, researching it, spending my personal time outside work cause I was just that invested. Mid way through, he tells me he will look into it too. He ends up hijacking it and finishing it using some of the work I had done ... Again I felt upset. Why do all that when you were gonna end up working and finishing it. Wtf??? Was I taking too long? Could you have not just directed me to get it done the way you wanted?   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways these are some examples that come to mind and I've gotten to a point where I just drag myself to work. I can't tell if it's valid to feel upset and hurt cause the company has been otherwise treating me well and my manager most of the times is cool and understanding but I can't help understand why I'm so frustrated and upset when I do work. Everyone else in the company seems to be at harmony. Nobody else seems to have trouble with one another. Why do I feel the outlier? Why do I feel so upset and angry at people? I'm so confused .... I cannot reason my emotions. I shouldn't feel this way I have work at a time many people don't and I'm getting paid well but why am I so upset and frustrated with people??",

So another thought I had was to go on these sites that offer developers for hire and vet them myself and then turn around and apply for jobs that allow third party applicants. The developer would then be handed over as a consultant to work on the project for the client. There would be no project management on my side. They would simply be a supplemental resource added to a client project. I would build a higher hourly rate and take a cut off the top of it.\n\nWhat am I missing here?

Most of my active development deals with AngularJS and Java 8/Spring.\n\nI wasn't interested in the support part at all, but I decided to continue with the job because I was afraid of the job market during the pandemic.

This team completely makes internal products, so we have next to no \"good code\". I have worked with better code than this in my second year of university. It ranges from ridiculous architectural designs, to unit tests that are written purely for the sake of it (think mocks an input and verifies that the input is mocked), and just zero handling of technical debt whatsoever.\n\nI have toyed with the idea of shifting to a different team that does work on consumer-facing products, considering I love the firm I'm at but that seems to be unlikely because our support team is currently in the middle of a resource crunch.

Skip to the tldr for the relevant question in bold:\n\nApplied for a job I wasn't qualified for (by accident), surprisingly, they still wanted to interview me. \n\nI did well in the first interview, was asked to do a second one with the team I'd be working with. That also went well. \n\nHad a 15 minute zoom call with the hiring manager (from the first interview), he wants to hire me, but (as described above) I'm not qualified for the position I applied for, but he wants to hire me for a position that's being created currently (already submitted to hr, they're doing approval before its posted). Told me it SHOULD take 1-2 weeks, but knowing hr, make that a month. \n\nHe told me I might consider doing a temp position in the mean time, but only if Hr could guarantee a smooth transition to the full time position. After about a week, hr could not give him the assurances he wanted, so he took the temp thing off the table and said we'd wait for the full time position.\n\nGot an update friday, they're negotiating the salary with hr now. Got another update this morning: position passed the first step of the approval process, he expects the job to (hopefully) \"post\" this week. He'll then move my application to that newly created position where he'll then tell hr he wants to hire me for that position. \n\n**I then asked what step comes next. He said hr will do their vetting of me, then they'll formally extend me the offer. He said the vetting will be normal stuff like checking references and my education. I have the bachelor's degree in computer science that is required for this entry level position, but I'm worried about my gpa. While i didn't see anything about gpa requirements, my college gpa was pretty shit (under a 3.0) because I switched majors yata yata yata. I've heard from a friend who's a software engineer at an insurance company, that she's had people get hired by the hiring manager, and then upon hr reviewing their application, denied the hire because of their gpa. I don't know how typical that is though. Couple questions then. First, how common is it for people to check your gpa (rather than just verify that you do in fact possess the required degree). Of the 4-5 places i've gotten interviews with the last year (fuck covid man, so many places are in a hiring freeze, if not outright laying people off), only one has requested my transcripts. Obviously I didn't get that job. And my second question, how common is it for places to then reject you if your gpa isn't above a certain threshold? I mean its not like its beneath a 2.0 or anything. its just not above 3.0. If i were to just give them my gpa for the last 2.5 years (5 semester) when i formally switched majors to computer science, my gpa is a 3.06. I think that's a lot more relevant to my skills than to look at my long gpa history when I was in a completely unrelated major.**\n\ndon't sugar coat it for me. This is the first time since i graduated last may that a company was actually interested in hiring me. Its a large university hiring for biomedical research they do. I'd hate to finally have a tentative offer only to have hr give the thumbs down. If my hiring manager (whom i've built a rapport with) is emphatic enough, could he sway them? \n\nThanks as always guys",

One is a return offer with the company I've been interning with, the other is a new company.\n\nI'm pretty content with both offers, although I do plan to negotiate, but that's not what this is about.\n\nIn one of the offers, my role would be Software Engineer and I'd be doing actual software engineering work. In the other, my role is an \"Application Engineer\", which uses some (much more advanced) Scratch like software to let you \"Drag n Drop\" applications together, with only minor programming involved. Beyond this, the role also entails a fair amount of project management, sales, etc (interacting with clients).\n\nSo my question is, if I want to be a software engineer in the future, would being an application engineer for a year + listing the entailed job responsibilities make it harder for me to transition to a full-time SE later on? I feel like if I'm applying for SE jobs and recruiters see \"Used Scratch++ to build applications for clients\", they won't be very impressed and may not be as likely to hire me compared to if I just had traditional SE experience. On the flip side though, I imagine they would like to see that I have soft skills (sales, PM, client management, etc) that I would not gain from the Software Engineer job.\n\nJust curious to see if anyone has any thoughts on this, of course there is no \"right\" answer!",

I have been fortunate enough to work a summer internship as a full-stack developer utilizing React and Node.JS (typescript for both) as well as a year long internship working as a system developer using Java (no frameworks AFAIK). I also have a lot of AI experience through clubs using Python but I am not really a big fan of working with ML/AI, still worth mentioning since I believe Django has a decent market share for backend.\n\nI am trying to make myself as attractive a candidate as possible through bolstering my personal portfolio. I have two projects on it thus far, both of which have used React and Node.JS. I am hoping to have a couple more full stack side projects by the time I graduate, on top of having my AWS certifications and enhancing my side projects with their services. \n\nI was wondering if you guys think it would be worth creating projects in C#/Java since currently I am hoping to work primarily in backend as this is the field I have found most compelling so far. Those two languages obviously dominate the backend job market currently but it seems like overkill to use these for projects that aren't of enterprise scale, in addition to having a higher learning curve than other languages and frameworks. I really like working with Node.JS and am quite comfortable throwing servers together with Express. I also have demonstrable work experience with Java thanks to my current internship even though it is not in a traditional web development setting. Ultimately, do you guys think it would be worth it to teach myself Java or C# for the backend of future side projects or would it be better to gain more experience with Node.JS? If so, should I bolster my Java knowledge or jump into C# which seems to be a much more developer friendly experience? Job market seems evenly split in my area.\n\nTL;DR, upcoming CS graduate can't decide if I should continue making side projects with Node.JS or branch off and learn Java/C# to prepare me for enterprise jobs",

I'd like to hear people's advice on whether this would be beneficial towards my main goal of growing my software career.\n--------\n\nI work at a startup as a Jr. SWE with 1 YOE as a SWE. I have a background in Mechanical Engineering, so I've been in the engineering world for about 7 years.  I've also done a lot of facilitation in my personal life outside of work - personal growth type things.\n\nWell, until now one of our Sr SWE's has been doubling as our SCRUM master (he also trained SCRUM masters before coming onboard with us). He just got promoted to Director of SW, and he asked me if I'd be interested to be the SCRUM facilitator for my team, because he's noticed my facilitation skills and thinks I'd be good at it.  I know SCRUM master is often a full-time job, but he said he doesn't expect me to do much more than go to the same meetings I'm going to now, like retro, standup, etc.  This is what he's been doing in the same position, so I believe him.\n\nIf I say yes, it'll come with a pay bump, although he hasn't given me a number yet. I'd also get to go to a SCRUM master training course, and I have no doubt he'd be very supportive.  I've been filling in for him from time to time, and I enjoy it.\n\nMy main goal is to grow my SW career, and this seems like it could be a good way to develop soft skills that will benefit me there. But I wouldn't want it to pull me away or detract from my primary focus of software engineering. I do, however, see how they could be complementary.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

For my second coop work term (Jan 2019), I only had 4 months of work experience, did like 50 applications, got 7-8 interviews and multiple offers. Now with that coop work term experience, I did almost 500 applications, over 10-12 interviews and no offer so far. I have done a lot of mock interviews, did 130 leetcode problems, had referrals, and had really good interviews but it seems like it is almost impossible to get an internship now. My friends who work at FAANG and with whom I practiced Mock, told me that the best way to approach a problem is to give them a suboptimal solution, then work with your interviewer to give an optimal solution, and even if you can't, if you share your thought process, they will take you in (one of my friend couldn't solve a faang problem but talked out his thought process and got the job at that same company). Seems like it is no longer the case. Interviewers want an optimal solution at the first try, and if I work with them, I just get rejected. I recently had an interview with SAP where they gave me 2 problems, i gave them optimal for the one and suboptimal for the second one and my interviewer told me I did really well, and I was really good at communicating my thought process, yet I got rejected.\n\nI really am feeling extremely burnt out and tired. if this is the norm, how can I even break into the industry? My high gpa that I worked really hard for, my interview prep that I spent hours after hours with my friends, spending time on my resume, countless mock interviews with coop office, paid service and with my friends, all are just going to waste. I am not only tired and concerned that maybe I should not be in the field in the first place. My other engineering friends even in this job market didn't have to go through that many interviews, and some coop programs (especially civil, mining and geotechnical) have almost 100% placement rate (meaning almost everyone who was in the coop program secured a work term this summer)\n\nI don't know, I chose software engineering because I really loved making small web and mobile apps, and always wanted to know how video games work, but it is really burning me out right now with all this interview prep and the disappointment I am getting after getting rejected even though I felt I did really well. It's endless cycle of rejections. I really want some advice as to what should I be doing next? Switching to some other engineering field? Go to grad school? Just give up? I am also really concerned as to whether I even have a chance to break into the career if this is the stage of internship interview, then new grad is almost next to impossible.\n\nAlso just to clarify, I am applying to everything, not just big name companies. Most of them are local with a few in other Canadian provinces and a few to US companies. \n\nThanks",

I started working harder and my performance improved, yet I was told \"I don't think you understand what's happening at the company\" after I crushed a sprint they claimed I wasn't expected to finish. I asked for very little help during this sprint which is why I'm confused he'd bring up my understanding. When performance wasn't an issue they brought up miscommunications (which had almost no impact) without commending my performance improvement, and on my first slow week after improving they fired me lol.

I've been working here since graduation and have an EE degree with a minor in CS. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to code or do many 'technical' projects while on these teams and don't have any internship experience, so I'm considering myself as having 'zero-experience' although that's not completely true.

[I saw this older post from the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6e0dm4/are_remote_entry_level_positions_rare/) about finding entry level remote positions, and how rare it is. Now that we've been working from home for the last year I imagine (or hope) that there would be more opportunities for entry level remote work? If that's the case, any advice on where to look? If not remote, what would be the best listings to find entry-level positions?\n2. It will be easiest for me to pivot internally but am interested in exploring other companies. I'm not sure if being at Microsoft is a better help considering my role but, is there anything you think I could do to better my chances of switching companies (beyond \"doing side projects\")?\n3. I'm currently going through CTCI and attempting a couple LeetCode problems a day (studying Java). My coding experience is limited to Java and C which I studied in school. I know that lots of companies use more modern languages such as React, TypeScript, etc. Is it necessary for me to learn these to standout as 'relevant' (such as taking a bootcamp course, or doing a side project in these languages)?  I know \"anything helps\" but 'm trying to optimize my studying since I have a full-time job.\n\nI may need some help deciding on whether to pivot companies or try to move internally (and then pivot) but would like to start here.

For reasons I don't want to get into, I decided that's not the path I want to take, I want to just do programming full-time. I do a little bit of SQL and Python at work, but not enough to satisfy me, or tell interviewers that I did proper software development in those languages, mostly bug fixes and scripting.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't have any real internships, I just volunteered on-and-off for about a year and a half on a website my friend made, it was C#, MS SQL, and Bootstrap. I wrote maybe like 10 web pages of varying complexity, with a lot of guidance from my friend. My friend stopped doing the website several months ago and I can't really carry it on, I don't have the permission or expertise, as he pretty much told me what to write and only I understood some (but not all) of it, though towards the end I was getting more independent. \n\nThe C# stack my friend used is pretty old, I really don't see many jobs requiring any of the front-end stuff we used; it's all react/angular and typescript/javascript now from what I'm seeing. In the few technical interviews I've made it to, they're surprised/disappointed I don't know REST, MVC, or Javascript. The jobs I'm applying for I can usually do fine in the interviews and pass the (easy) coding assessment, I just don't think I tick the boxes for recruiters or hiring managers because my stack isn't really common anymore.\n\nAs all my C# experience sorta ended several months ago, I'm really rusty on remembering how certain things worked and my friend really isn't available to help me with that stuff. Unfortunately for me, this seems like the best life line I have on my resume to hop over to software development.\n\nAre there any options I have other than just spending all my free time forcing myself to learn javascript/typescript/angular/rest, or will the right opportunity come along eventually? I don't really care if I'm front-end or back-end, I just want a job and obviously the least amount of extra work I have to do after working 40+ hours a week would be nice. Are there other things I should prioritize learning instead? And just as a note, I'm not trying to get into a FAANG here, just any old job would be cool.\n\n**tl;dr - Only real experience other than my cs degree was some volunteering on a website where I was guided through everything by a more senior dev.

This was January 2020.\n\nAt that point I escalated it two levels up and had a one on one with the manager of all software engineering for my company.  He was definitely more receptive but was also trying to make the point that I was \"silo'ed\" and needed to do more stuff to get my work noticed.\n\nCoincidentally a month later we had a huge project come in with an incredibly aggressive timeline.  I was able to shift gears quickly and help complete the project, being a fundamental part of it.  This brought us up into March of 2020. \n\nThen COVID hit and I was told that I was SOL and come back in 3-6 months.  That sucked a lot especially since I had busted my ass for a huge company win.  I basically went on cruise control for the next several months, and kept inquiring about my promotion once the 3 month mark had passed.  I started looking for new employment during the summer, just passively and when I had time.  I had probably a dozen interviews over the past year to varying levels of success, some I got really close to closing.\n\nMy manager kept checking and the answer was always no.  As fall and winter rolled around I started nagging more about it.  It was pretty rough, on one end you have corporate saying \"there is no hiring freeze\" but then your manager saying \"all adjustments are on hold.\"  \n\nI had to sit through multiple town halls where they paraded marquees of all the people who did get promotions.  It felt like everyone was getting a promotion BUT ME.  At this point my manager had done a complete 180 and was pretty angry I had been neglected.  During my 2020 performance review I got the highest possible rating.\n\nDespite all this, the corp still tried to say no to my promotion.  This brings us to March 2021.  Upon hearing their refusal again I got more aggressive with my job search.  There were some murmurings that my promotion was going through but it was still taking forever and I was given no ETA.\n\nAfter taking a hackerrank from a company and probably getting what I would consider a C- to D+ on it (finished 4/5 of the problems, most without all test cases fulfilled) I was able to secure an offer of 85k.  I told my employer I was going to leave if they weren't able to get my promotion and more than the offer by Friday.\n\nI was contacted the next day by the manager of software engineering and asked for my range, which I said was 90-100.  He offered me my promotion and 80 on the spot which I turned down, and was confused by.  Pretty much said give me 90-100 or I'm walking.\n\n24 hours later I had secured the promotion to level 3 and a new salary of 90k a year.  It's amazing how fast these things can turn around when you threaten to walk.  I'm pretty happy now, and I didn't want to leave the company I work for because it has great perks and an awesome work life balance.\n\nThanks for reading!",

I did everything as good as I could and people were impressed, but they did not take me because they said that the project had no future, since it was too different.\nFirst job: was hired as a ML developer in the testing department and was the only Machine Learning developer in the firm. Never had a mentor and was put in the position to talk directly to clients. No code review, no guidance, they just asked for solutions. And the pay was terrible (even though the company is big).

        "body": "So a bit of background:\n\n* I started out at this company as an intern last summer. After the summer, I was offered the opportunity to co-op part-time while finishing up my last year of school. I graduate in just a couple of weeks now.\n* In February, I asked my boss about a potential full-time position after I graduate. After some back and forth, he basically said that quarterly results would depend on whether or not a position would be available. However, I would be given the option to extend my co-op until August to see if any more positions open up then.\n* In April, I bring up the question again. He says that at the moment he can't tell me anything. \n* Yesterday I asked him if my next steps at this company were to continue the co-op or if any positions have opened since I graduate soon. I have not gotten a response as of the writing of this post.\n\nWhile I understand that the bottom line ultimately affects the availability of positions, this company has also been hiring for similar positions while I've been co-op'ing for them, so I find the 'quarterly results' reasoning to be a bit questionable.\n\nThat being said, I can tell that my boss has definitely made an attempt to get me a full-time position since he has generally been impressed with my work. I have a feeling that he couldn't tell me anything in April because he was in the middle of discussing it with the company.\n\nAs for the lack of response from yesterday's email, I think it's most likely because he thinks that I'm going to leave if he tells me there isn't a position now. \n\nI haven't had trouble landing interviews, and I know that it's only a matter of time before I land a position somewhere. Money is a little tight, but I will be able to manage for the time being. So, should I give my two weeks' notice?",

        "body": "Trying to get some outsiders' thoughts on my situation so I can gauge how it compares to other workplaces. This is my second job as a programmer, and my first was a two-year stint at a company where there were no other programmers at all, so I don't have much basis for reference.\n\nI work at a smaller company of about 40 people total. The dev team is 8 people including me and my boss the CTO. Our product is a SaaS service with a few tens of thousands of users.\n\nI've been here for three years and am the only \"senior engineer.\" I got promoted into this role after one year at the company. In any reasonable situation, I would probably not hold the \"senior\" title, but I'm a big fish in a small pond in that the rest of the team (including my boss) are very junior engineers who frequently need hand-holding with basic concepts.\n\nStuff that has me unhappy in my role:\n\nWe don't do testing, full stop. Nobody on the team, including me, has experience writing tests. (I don't think most even understand what tests are or why they're useful.) QA is done by one non-technical guy clicking around the platform to see if everything seems good.\n\nSince the app is large and sprawling, the above QA process is not enough to prevent the regular occurrence of severe bugs in production. The process for resolving such situations is to Slack me, tell me it's super urgent, and let me figure it out. It's not practical to attempt to involve other members of the team, since they have neither the general experience nor the familiarity with the codebase to be able to help. (To his credit, my boss often tries to investigate the problem himself if it's something urgent, but again, doesn't usually have the knowledge or problem-solving skills needed to be of any help.)\n\nNew features are developed by the junior devs with little guidance. (Being the senior engineer, I try to provide guidance to the best of my ability, but I don't have the time to be closely involved in several different ongoing projects when I'm also assigned my own time-sensitive projects and have to field regular emergencies.) Once a PR is made, it goes through a perfunctory \"code QA\" process, where another member of the team, usually another junior dev, glances over it to make sure nothing is obviously wrong.\n\nIt then passes into \"product QA\" and is put in a staging environment where the QA guy clicks around to see if it looks good. (The process of deploying code to that QA environment takes about half an hour each time and often fails. There was a project done by the CTO and the previous senior engineer in collaboration with an external company over the course of about a year to improve our infrastructure, which somehow resulted in the current cumbersome and error-prone process, where I often have to interrupt my work to resolve issues with it so that QA can continue.) When he finds problems, he writes them down somewhere, and the dev responsible for the project will resolve the QA issues by making further commits that are not subject to code review. This process usually accounts for at least half of the time spent working on large projects, so a great deal of the code that makes it into production was never looked at by anyone. \n\nDeadlines do not change in response to changing situations during development and QA. For big projects, the norm is that on the day the deadline rolls around, we're still actively working on fixing aspects of the feature that are fundamentally broken, and very likely also continuing to receive new information and requirements from the product and design teams.\n\nThe good: my boss is nice, people in general are nice, I've never been yelled at or anything. I'm rarely expected to work more than 40 hours, although in practice I sometimes end up working weekends and see other devs doing so as well.\n\nI dunno, a lot of this is coming out as an angry rant, but I'm aware that there are really toxic workplaces out there and I probably have it good. Is this just the kind of stuff that all workplaces have? Any thoughts are appreciated.",

Like 3 hours east of Seattle\n\nSo I've been working my way into computer science since the 5th grade. I've done a ton of minor things and have dipped my toe into every nook and cranny I can think of. Nothing particularly impressive, but it sounds flashy enough to interest some people\n\nI'm ready to call it for software engineering. That's my role in life, and I want to call myself a software engineer\n\nBut I'm not sure what to do now. I'm a high school senior, dual-enrolled in college with the end goal of a bachelor's in computer science\n\nBut what do I do right now? Should I just work at a fast food place until I get something I can show to a development company? Should I find a computer repair shop to work at? It's not where I want to end up, but it's still in the same vain\n\nAre personal projects worth anything? What personal projects carry weight? Is it overkill to try making my own operating system to show off knowledge or is that about what I should aim for?\n\nHow important are grades? I can pass the class, but not always with a perfect grade. If I can show practical knowledge, will that get me far enough?\n\nAnd when am I ready to apply at the \"important\" companies? \nWhen do I start applying for junior dev roles and such? I'm just lost right now. Any help is appreciated",

From lurking on this thread I get the idea that after a few years of experience it gets a lot easier for the job search so I feel I can take more risks then.\n\nHowever some of my friends got return offers at FATMAN with compensation on the high end of L3 (TC: 200+) and even though my offer is not FATMAN or Big N I think there could have been some room for negotiation",

        "body": "I currently work for a very large global company that offers good benefits and a 50k annual salary, but I just got offered an internship with the Disney College Program which lasts about 6 months. I graduated a year ago in May 2020 and getting to for a famous entertainment/tech company seems like a dream come true. This internship pays me 1/3rd less than what I\u2019m being paid right now. Here are some thoughts I had about this scenario: \n\nIf I leave my current company and go for Disney, I\u2019m going for something... \n\n1. I have a chance for something that seems like a lifetime! It\u2019s like you rather go for something and say you did it rather than regretting later that you should have done it \ud83d\ude2d \n2. My dream company is Disney \n3. It might open opportunities for me because I work for Disney at a certain period \n4. And I\u2019m looking for a job now anyway trying to get out of my current job! \n5. It\u2019s 6 months and the job isn\u2019t secure \n\nIf I decline the offer from Disney,\n\n1. I don\u2019t like my job that I\u2019m currently at and I\u2019ll keep thinking about declining that offer I had from my dream company that I had a chance to! \n2. I have a full time job now vs 6 months at Disney.\n3. My associates I work with now are amazing which I can make new friends at Disney so I\u2019m not too worried about that. \n4. The pay is way more here than in Disney \n5. Can work and still make money while looking for a new job rather than a deadline if I were at Disney \n\nI am so excited about this opportunity but the thought of leaving my current full time job for \u201cjust a 6 month internship\u201d, which makes me so overwhelmed! \n\nI started this job last December 2020, and my internship begins in August 2021! I had an internship with Disney back in August 2020 but it got canceled due to COVID - 19.  I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m risking for something that isn\u2019t secure when I have something already secured. And I know my parents wouldn\u2019t be too happy with that as well. I want to ask for time off but 6 months seems like a lot of time. \n\nI\u2019m 23 and I live with my parents. I\u2019m saving a lot of money now but my current job requires a lot of relocation in the future for higher positions. The situation at home is getting unbearable which is why I\u2019m always out all the time until I have to come home.\n\nSo it really feels like I\u2019d be wasting this opportunity if I I don\u2019t take it. And this internship is a big change for me where I feel like I can\u2019t say no. But I feel like if I leave my full time position for something that\u2019s temporary - I would feel very uptight about it. \n\nI\u2019m afraid I may be making a huge mistake for my future and feel so indecisive as to the pathway I should take.

        "body": "Hey all,\n\nI've been browsing this sub for a while now.  I sometimes comment, but usually, just lurk.  I'm currently in quite a conundrum...\n\nAnyways, I'll try to make this as short and succinct as I can without leaving out the full story.  So, I graduated college in 2019 with a degree in marketing.  I realized soon after graduating that I didn't care at all about marketing.  In my marketing degree, I actually took a programming class.  It involved JavaScript and programming web apps.\n\nI of course have heard all the hype about coding bootcamps and securing high salaries with the knowledge and apps(added to portfolio) from Bootcamps.  I decided to just jump in full steam to a coding bootcamp.  I ended up finishing it right when the dumbass pandemic hit.. (April 2020 I believe)\n\nOf course, when Covid first hit the economy tanked and a lot of jobs went away..  Finding an entry-level software job as someone without a CS degree proved to nearly impossible.  I went pretty hard on the job search regardless, however.  Over 500 apps later I got burnt out.  I had a few interviews but they didn't really go anywhere.\n\nWith feeling like nothing was getting accomplished, I figured perhaps if I want to get into this field I needed a CS degree to be taken seriously.  And I figured if I got a good job while taking classes I could either throttle down to 1 class per semester or perhaps just *unofficially* drop out. (Meaning just not re-registering for classes..)  I ended up applying to a few colleges, and got accepted to most.  But chose one.\n\nWell, fast forward to the present.  I just bombed my math midterm.  There's only one math class I have to take though. (And tbh I don't care about grades I just want the degree and the knowledge)  I'm wondering if I should just take the L and power through it.  Or if this perhaps a sign more schooling isn't for me?\n\nObviously, you don't have to be in school to continue on one's learning path.  I continue to grind out leetcode.  To brush up on stuff I learned in the past, along with learning new things.\n\nPerhaps I'm justifying wanting to just drop out.  If I'm being honest I'm starting to think I don't even care about SWE.  I just want a good-paying WFH job where I can afford a mortgage(in MCOL area) and able to buy as many video games I want. (lol)\n\n**TL;DR(Sort of):** I don't have a degree in CS, but want to get into the industry.  So did coding bootcamp, but can't get a job.  Despite applying to hundreds of jobs, constantly revising my resume, and doing most everything; *Except getting a degree in CS*.  So I decided to get a degree in CS.  In first semester, but just bombed my math midterm.(I understand the material, just suck at taking tests btw)  Questioning everything....  Any advice?  (Btw I actually enjoy programming, and it fits my personality, so I would like to somehow get a programming job..) *I hate school, but love learning as well, that's a pretty important thing to mention if I'm being 100% honest..*",

I'm really just looking for any kind of software development internship, but a lot of them are looking for some kind of experience with certain frameworks and technologies that I just haven't been exposed to in my curriculum. \n\nI'm looking for some way to bolster my resume this summer if I'm not lucky enough to nail down an internship. From a little bit of looking around, Coursera seems to be the best way for me to gain a little bit of extra experience over the summer. \n\nThis may be a bit of a foolish question since I don't have anything specific in mind, but are there any sorts of courses/specializations that you would recommend to someone that could help me cast the widest net when applying for jobs in the future? \n\nThanks in advanced.",

(It was due to a longstanding bug in the framework) With that in place I was done (could have finished much earlier if he had responded two weeks in advance)\n\nI just had a performance review where he told me that he felt \"I was struggling\" because I \"depended on him too much for help instead of doing independent research\". I'm completely crushed.

I'm a 3rd-year CS major, and I took off school for this experience, as I thought working for a really good company would help me professionally. It's a big company most of you have heard of, but I'll keep their name quiet.\n\nMy expectations for this internship were to maybe debug some code, write small scripts (I work for an automation team), and do small things to start. I wrote maybe half of a working script before I got assigned a major project. \n\nWhile I'm grateful for the experience this gives me, I still feel like maybe I was overworked? Overestimated? I'm to build a web app from front-to-back, that helps us automate some internal workflows. I was assigned this entirely to myself, the intern, and had freedom to choose the tech stack. I was given some repos and libraries to reference, as they were similar/needed to what I was tasked to build. Then, off I go to build an entire web app.\n\nI was interviewed for Python automation, but now I'm building a fullstack web app from scratch. I'm spending most of my time writing React code, which I had 0 knowledge of going into this. I was hoping for more Python work, as I would like to go into Data Science in the future, and Python is heavily needed for that, but I'm stuck writing JavaScript.\n\nTo be fair, I have learned a ton. Enough to produce a pretty usable app, but there's a lot of fault and bugs that I'm sure are due to my lack of experience. I'm constantly rewriting my code, my manager doesn't look over my code too often, and I'm kinda just this free-roaming fullstack web developer with little guidance. My mentor isn't too available, and remote work make this whole internship a hell of a lot harder.\n\nIs any of this normal? Is this just my imposter syndrome?

I'm also graduating in a month, so luckily enough, I wouldn't have to job hunt after that.\n\nHowever, in the long run, Support isn't what I would like to do. Moreover, my mentor at the company says that, after a year of working in support, I would be able to switch to a team of my liking, depending on my skills, ofcourse.\n\nAnd here's where I'm stuck. I do know that I want to go for a development role, rather that marketing, or Customer relations, etc. But what sort of developer? Full Stack Engineer is something I'm currently eyeing. My final year project is based on NLP, so ML/AI also sounds great, but I hear that freshers or people with just a year of experience aren't preferred for it. I have some knowledge of iOS app development, so that seems like a possible alley too.\n\nTo give you a clear picture, here is my list of preference, and how much I know I'm each:\n\n1. Full Stack/Web Dev - Good with front end (just, good); okay with backend, need to be a lot better; can learn database, it's been more that 2 years since I typed a query\n\n2. iOS - Only learning a little but of Swift, still not good, but will be soon\n\n3. ML/AI - decent exposure through a research project (yet to be published), however, it doesn't interest me as much as the previous two\n\nI'd say it's almost a tie between 1 and 2\n\nNow, coming to the long route; let's say I'm not able to move to a Dev role at my present company after a year, for whatever reason.

How can I move to a Dev role, from a support role.\n\nAnd if anyone can give me tips on how to learn, or what to learn to be good at the mentioned fields, please do help me out\n\nCheers :)",

        "body": "TLDR; husband is depressed and overwhelmed and stopped working again. But we are in debt for his startup. What can I do?\n\n\\---\n\nMy husband has been doing startups for over 8 years. He has been as an executive within several startup companies in the first few years, then he started to do his own startups one after another. He failed at most of it. One of them is however still alive but he got a fight with his former partner so he left that company.\n\nLast year he got really depressed and not working for half of year. This year, he got another idea and found another guy who he found really happy to work with as business partners so they started a new company. He was super excited and felt happy again. He's been meeting people for several months and I would say he's actually doing very well at impressing people. But recently he started to be depressed again. I think he tends to get tired or overwhelmed by the things he doesn't like to do (exp, real management work, financial, etc), and he keeps having new ideas he wants to do and gets distracted. Also he borrowed some money so I think he's also very anxious about finance. Anyway, recently since he's depressed, he basically stopped working, instead, he watches TV and playing video games most of the time.\n\nI don't know what to do. I tried to cheer him up or ignore his emotions and just focusing my own stuffs, but it didn't help. I tried to talk to him a long time ago (this kind of situation is not the first time, it happens to him a lot) and he just got more depressed or angry, or he went to work the rest of that day but return to play games the next day...I wasn't anxious when he borrowed the money, because I thought it's normal in the beginning phase, but now I am really worried. One day, he said he wanted to go to restaurants, but I said we are in debts so we should save any little pennies. But he disagreed and still went out.\n\nI'm not just worrying about finance, I'm more worried about him. With his serial entrepreneurship history, I think a lot of companies will avoid hiring him if someday he wants to go back to be an employee. Also because he was either CTO or CEO, so a lot of senior developer positions will just overlook him. The last reason I'm worried is because, it looks like if he fails this time or abandons it again, he will think his life is completely over and it will be very hard for him to get back to his feet again.",

For the junior software developer position at Reef, I'll primarily be working front-end and I have the opportunity to work permanently remote. The glassdoor reviews for Reef aren't that great but they are coming from other types of jobs like valets, drivers, and kitchen cooks. I've met the team I'd be working for at Reef and they seem great. They were a smaller startup that recently got acquired by Reef a couple of months ago.  \nA developer friend advised me to go for the Reef job because it's more of a typical SWE job and I guess being a consultant isn't really that glamorous in the cs world? I'd love to hear others' opinions on being an AWS cloud tech consultant vs a typical junior software developer and which job I should take if I do end up getting an offer Slalom.",

        "body": "Hi all. A little background about me... I graduated from a MS in Math last May. I have extensive coursework in math/stats/CS/ML, did a computation-heavy thesis (simulations in Python, not ML) which led to a publication as first author, and taught undergrad calculus. My university was a no-name state university in a rural area with few connections to tech and I don't have much of a network. I have no industry experience/internships -- I intended to do a PhD but realized it wasn't for me.\n\nDue to health issues I've been taking time off after graduating. I've sharpened my technical skills and completed a few projects in the last few months and have started applying for jobs. I think my background and interests are most suited to a DS role; however, these roles seem to be highly contested by PhDs and people with several YoE. My math background should put me ahead of many candidates (e.g. non-quantitative BS + MSDS), but I feel my lack of a PhD or previous experience prevents me from being a strong candidate. Also, because of how poorly-defined DS roles are, I get the sense a lot of companies don't know what they're looking for, and the interviews can test you on anything.\n\nI've heard that starting as a analyst or SWE is a better route into DS/ML. I'm not really interested in the dashboarding and SQL duties that an analyst role entails. I've learned some web dev skills (Django, JS/React, etc.) to deploy ML models and think a SWE (web dev) role could be fitting. I'd have to practice LC like hell, though.\n\n**Given my background should I apply to DS or SWE positions to optimize my chance of landing a job?** I'm more aligned with DS, but it is insanely competitive at entry level, and my callback rate has been low. Alternatively, I have *some* SWE skills and the barrier to entry is lower.",

However, I hated my job so much that I'm switching to backend now.\n\nThe thing is, while doing your own frontend portfolio projects you are developer, client and designer all at the same time. That means you can get as creative as you want. You want a website with a poop emoji as cursor? You can do it. Nobody dictates how something should look, act or behave. You are completely free. Kinda like an artist.\n\nHowever, working as frontend developer felt like the exact opposite. Your only task is to translate the ideas of your designer and his clients into code. Your website has to be a perfect copy of a template somebody else has made. It's was depressing and I simply couldn't stand it anymore.  Maybe it sounds a bit arrogant, but I'm not a google translator where you can input a design and who translates it into code and then displays the result in the browser.\n\nHow do you feel about it and what are your experiences?",

I just want something more for myself and I don\u2019t want my age to be a factor as to yeah I should have this and that figured out, etc. \n\nI started school at my local community college in the fall of 2019, I finished up my last 2 gen Ed\u2019s, college algebra and csc 111. The following spring I took precalc 1 and csc 112 and ended up failing those classes because the pandemic started and zoom classes just wasn\u2019t doing it for me (yes I know that\u2019s a bad excuse and I should of passed). So fast forward to now, I will be taking precalc 1 & 2 this summer.\n\nMy goal is to take all the lower level CS classes at my community college and transfer them back to the university I first attended. At that point I will have to finish my upper level courses, electives and another math class (calc 2 I think it is).\n\nAt my community college, I have 7 classes left to take:\nComputer science 2\nDatabase management systems \nData structures and algorithms \nDiscrete mathematics \nCalc 1  \nPrecalc 1 & 2\n\nAll the classes above except precalc 1 & 2 are transferable to university.\n\nOkay so I guess that\u2019s a lot of background info...but my question is it worth going back to school at this age? I would like to be a software engineer. A lot of ppl have counted me out unfortunately. I want to prove them wrong as well as prove to myself I can do this. Also Idk if information science & technology could be an option as well because the CS math courses are kinda scary and I\u2019m not a math wiz or anything.

I like learning new things, but my role in this company is testing, not CRM shit.\n\n\\-The team leader said stuff like \"This is gonna be a very very fast paced project, meaning, everything is gonna have a deadline for yesterday\" and \"with all my teams I demand pushing\" which put off a lot of the people in the presentation\n\n\\-And lastly, the team leader demanded us to have a cameras on during all calls.

I'm decent at leetcode and it kinda come to me easier because of my math background. But the caveat of this switch is maintaining a salary that helps out my fam for atleast now (willing to relocate anywhere I just help them financially). Wondering if it's doable and if so if you guys have advice.\n\n**Long Form Explanation Below:**\n\n1. I work at a semiconductor foundry as a materials engineer. I'm the guy trynna make sure the supply meets demand however, I want to switch over to CS because I don't like the location and I am decent at coding.\n2. With my background I didn't know which direction to go through so I went on free code camp and just went the web dev route. Thought why not.\n3. I want to leverage my previous technical experience so I was wondering if you all wanted to help me find my place in the Computer Science world. I already know python due to using for research before. However, the data science route seemed to be the most stringent on degrees and certifications. That's why I started to pick up web dev. Seemed the most fluid and I can knock out javascript and a couple projects by the end of the year.\n4. My only caveat with not leverging my current resume is that I do have a salary requirement. I am right now helping my family out and paying for their bills along with mine for now since they got screwed by the pandemic. It won't be for long but I would need to maintain my salary of 89k atleast to do so. Is that doable if I switch? I can leetcode very very well. I am learning the whole algorithms and data structures aspect but, my math background kinda helps out a lot (I dual majored in math in college). This whole thing got brought up because my friend at Capital One landed about that much starting off in Texas. But I don't know if he was a fluke. ",

I've seen people say they've been put on projects that only last a couple moths. Afterwards it seems like they would have to wait until Revature finds a new position for them once their current is over and finding a job on your own with a company they're not affiliated with would violate the contract.

I understand that the TSE is more on the side of maintaining and fixing what's already built. I'd like some feedback on this role, mainly on what it entails and whether it will help me progress in my career in a healthy way. Will this role limit my prospects in the future? Is it more advisable to turn the role down and hunt harder for an MSE specific role? Is it easy to transfer over from a TSE role to an MSE role? If I do accept the offer, I will likely work hard in this for 2 years, read/learn as much as I can and switch into an MSE role....is that feasible?",

Since I wasn't aware whether I'm getting the raise or not  (when inquiring I was only told that it's in progress, I sort of felt like I'm not getting it) I began searching for something new. \n\nI applied for couple of companies, got couple much better offers and told my manager look, I got these much better offers what raise can you offer me to stay - this was very lucrative since they offered me 30% raise. The offers I got were still better by around 20% but since I like my current job, maybe it's a bit boring but I'm working only couple hours a day realistically with no stress and flexibile working hours, I stayed.\n\nBut then there was this one company that I was in recruitment process with and just for kicks, because I got the raise already, I told them I want a LOT of money - we're talking around 50% more than my current role with a raise. \n\nIt's worth mentioning that I work in Europe where I'm already earning the top 2% salary in my country.\n\nIt seems they weren't really discouraged by that and I got the offer.\n\nNow I'm faced with a really tough decision - whether to stay in my comfortable current role which already pays a lot ,with no stress and working couple of hours a day or change for this new one.\n\nThe new role has couple of cons though\n\n* the working hours are not that flexible (8-16) I prefer working a bit earlier (7-15)\n* more work - I'm assuming I will have to start working like a regular human being 8 hours a day\n* more responsibility since I would assume ownership of their app and will be the only person working on it\n* changing jobs is always stressful since there will be new people which might not be reasonable (the guys I spoke during the interview were pokay though)\n\nI feel I'm already a bit spoiled by the current role and it might be healthy for me to start working more :D \n\nBut whenever I think about the cons I also think about money which would allow me to buy a house in my country every year :D",

        "body": "So, a bit of context.\n\nI've been in tech for a bit less than 4 years now. Initially, I was working with a lot of technologies like .NET/Android/Deployement as an intern/Jr Developer. But since mid-2018 I've been mostly working in Front-end. In these 4 years, I've worked at 3 different companies (a small tech service company, a big product based e-commerce firm, and a couple years-old decently funded startup). So, it's safe to say that I've seen it all.  \n\n\nBack in high-school I had a huge interest in CS and always aced the CS exams and that's the reason I got a CSE degree (from a below-average school with average grades). But that's not the case now. Since the past 2 years, I'm constantly doubting if CS is really the right career for me. To be honest, the only reason I'm in tech is because it pays well. But, there's no gurantee that 10 years from now, there would still be such high salaries for software engineers. Currently the demand-supply ration is skewed towards engineers (for mid and senior positions). But, with 10 year olds learning to code in school, It's hard to envision what the future will be.\n\n  \nI'd love to study CS concepts even if I wasn't paid to do it. But working in the industry, it just induces so much anxiety to me on a daily basis. One reason for that is that I'm just not good enough and I'm probably mediocre at best (possiblly low-iq or I'm just not wired that way). But even if that were true, I see a lot of mediocre guys who are living a stress-free life.\n\n  \nThe reason for my anxiety is that there's so much to wrap your head around and it's hard to keep up if you want to stay in the industry. Due to living in constant hell, I'm considering a career-shift in psychology due to the following reasons:\n\n1. It would help me understand myself better and figure out the issues I'm going through\n2. I've always been intersted in how the brain functions what causes addictions.\n3. It woud give me some time to heal my brain\n4. Psychology degrees are not as demanding as CS (from what I've heard). This could be a chance to explore other interests and figure out what I really want to do with my life.\n\n  \nPlan is to go for a master's degree and then probably go into a specalised field where I could use both, my CS and Psych degree or work my way towards a Phd.\n\nI don't know if I'm delusional or just straight up crazy. But, life's too short.  I don't want to be 80 and have regrets that I just wasted my life doing something I wasn't enjoying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr;**\n\nWorkign as a software engineer in the industry is mentally taxing.

I like the job I guess, but I don't have any work experience in CS related fields besides this one, so what do I know about whether I really like it or not lol. I've been here for 2 months, by the end of month 3 I am apparently supposed to either get fired or be offered a full time position there (I am like 90% sure I'm getting a full time offering fwiw). No idea what the full time salary would be, but I imagine its probably around $36/hr? Just based off vague salary discussions with my friend who works there lol\n\nI feel like I have so little experience, and so I feel a desire to reach out and just acquire as many work experiences as possible. To me, working somewhere new often seems like an important thing to do since I'm young and trying to dip my feet in the water you know? But my friend says its too soon and I should at least get a full year with this company, saying that it looks bad if I were to work somewhere for less than a year. However, don't internships carry the connotation of being a work thing that is understood to not have to be a year+ endeavour? So I was thinking maybe I could get away with only working there for 3-4 whatever months, and then snagging a new job that hopefully teaches new things and experiences I wouldn't normally learn from working at this specific company. I have to acknowledge though, I am so new to a lot of software engineering that if I worked at this company for a full year I know I would learn plenty of software development...\n\nI made a bullet list of reasons I want to and don't want to leave. I was wondering if anyone here could graciously offer their advice/suggestion on what I should do? **Should I try to find a new job after working at an internship for 3-4 months, or stay with the company for a full time SW Eng. position because its too short of a time to dip out?**\n\nReasons I want to leave:\n* I feel a strong urge to get many different work experiences while I'm young\n* I want to work abroad badly. I'd stay with this job if they let me work remote 100% of the time temporarily, like for a 6 month span so that I could live abroad, but I highly doubt that they'd let me do that even if covid is still going on\n* Not 100% sure, but I think I could find a job with better pay than this company without much difficulty. I just say that because I think its a small enough company and the nature of the company + my experiences so far makes it seem like the kind of company that compensates for paying employees less by giving them greater work freedom/control over their actual programming and promising better wlb.\n\nReasons I don't:\n* This company has incredible wlb, definitely better than almost all other places\n* I actually work with a long time college friend here who helped me get the job, I would definitely miss working with him but you know, if its better for my future career prospects I'm not gonna stay at one company forever just to work with a friend",

When I raised certain concerns about the ability to integrate a new technology into multiple projects that all currently have different build library dependencies and asked about a compromise solution that has been brought up before, I was told that I need to show more respect to the time that was put in to the current proposed solution and that they felt they were only hearing excuses for not wanting to use a new technology (note that I am not the only one to raise these questions before this happened).\n2. When a discussion about this technology was held with a wider group of people that are involved in projects that would be incorporating this new technology at some point (some relatively soon and other a bit later), another person brought up the issue about the build library dependencies (and other issues) and suggested the same compromise solution I did in the previous meeting and I made mention of a task that we had planned for testing that possible issue (this was the outcome of the previous mentioned meeting). Just me bring this up made the same person from the previous meeting tell me that it was an inappropriate setting to bring this up (which I though was odd as that task directly relates to the question that was asked) and that he feared that what I am doing is trying to spread unfair fear and doubt about this technology (other people have brought up other / similar concerns but maybe this person thinks they are only doing that because of me or something).\n\nIf people want to disagree with my opinions or even concerns that I had, I have no problem with that, I am not a stranger to being in the minority when it comes to certain opinions on how to proceed with things but the outcomes of these disagreements are always based on data in some form and not accusing other people of lying or making things up to get their way. What I have virtually zero tolerance for is some telling me I mean something other than what I am saying. If I thought a piece of technology should not be used, I would say exact that with whatever reasons I have for thinking that way.\n\nNormally I would try to have a one on one with this person to figure out a better way to work together however given that in my limited interactions with this person I have already be accused of some ulterior motive that is deeper than what I am actually say, I would have concerns about a one on one and how this person might\u00a0view\u00a0that\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0completely\u00a0different\u00a0manner.\n\nRight now I really don't want to work with this other person at all as I think this kind of hostile work interaction is completely avoidable and counter-productive to the work we are trying to do (I have only deal with this kind of situation, though not directly, once in my 13+ years as a software engineer) and adding this kind of unnecessary stress in addition to the stress that is inherit with the job is just not worth it for me but because of the dynamics of the teams, I think future interactions are unavoidable. The only thing I can think of is agreeing to work on projects with this person but just holding any feedback I might have as to decisions on how to move forward on those project to myself to avoid derailing any project because of something that might not even be related to the project itself and just doing what tasks are given to me.\n\nHow would you handle this situation?",

Don't get me wrong, I think in many ways it's helpful and reasonable to expect data scientists to know SQL, be familiar with spark, *maybe* sagemaker and its equivalents, but so many listings seem to be seeking individuals who are experts as data scientists while also being experts at things like building dashboards, reporting, data lakes, pipelines, system design, engineering-intensive scalable cloud stuff...\n\nAre these listings the equivelant of unrealistic software engineering listings seeking \"rock star programmers\" who do everything under the sun? I'm an expert in selecting, training, and tuning ML algorithms, exploring large datasets, gathering all of the info needed to truly understand what is what and what things mean, finding ways to solve business problems using data science and defining use-cases... I've worked alongside engineers and analysts in the past but I've never been expected to be one, but maybe to have my skills overlap with theirs occasionally.\n\nDo I need to get a bunch of AWS certs for all of their data tools and reporting tools? Is that what's expected these days or is that just what a lot of the more out of touch postings look for?",

I got contacted by a small consultancy company, and after talking with the CEO he offered me a chance to work on a new project developing a WEB application from the ground up, that will offer a new service to their clients.\n\nMy concern is that only me and another intern would be working on the project. The choice of the tech-stack, design, etc. will be left up to us. It feels like quite a lot of responsibility for an intern with not that much experience.\n\nAnother problem is that the CEO will be our supervisor. He isn't a strong programmer and we won't have access to more experienced developers to learn from, ask questions, or get some suggestions. I lack the confidence that we can make the best decisions and handle all the aspects of development by ourselves as interns. On the positive side, if we come up with a viable solution we will have a job there after the internship.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I overthinking this and should just accept this internship position or try to find a place that has a bigger dev team that I could learn from? How important was it for you to communicate and learn from more experienced developers during your internship?\n\nTL;DR - Got offered an internship position in a small company where I won't be able to work with or learn from other, more experienced developers.

I have to do frontend, backend, integrate software modules with robots, even go make dataset by myself from scratch, integrate custom circuits with the software myself, write unit tests and check if the machine (It's like a prototype for a production line with computer vision, robotics and other automated solutions) is working correctly. \n\nWhen I joined this startup back in August 2020, They literally gave me a shitty accountant's computer and was like good luck. No onboarding, no shit. They were like they want to do X. So I, from scratch had to build up the codebase that we currently have . Also note that there is nobody to help me label the images or to create datasets, I spend my time building datasets and implementing machine learning pipelines for this system. 50% of my time, I write new features for the code base I make, and the other 50% I test and make sure everything works (physically on the machine / hardware setup) without glitches. There were times when I had to literally go and solder connections between different microprocessors in different modules of this system. I had to setup the system infrastructure (Nvidia GPU Compute server + Network based control and integration different electronic subsystems) and Software Architecture from absolute scratch.\n\nNow the CEO (an asshole) keeps pushing new features one after the other like a feature creep, he doesn't care what I do, he doesn't understand shit about code. Nobody at this startup codes. Recently, he has stopped caring about this project like there are no meetings, or so regrading this major project. He gives a big fuck to the smallest things like why is there dust on the robots? (LOL). So recently, This Boomer CEO is like can you teach me how to code so he can do my job(lol wtf?) . I genuinely thought he is interested in learning programing. Now he is blackmailing me if I don't teach him with PowerPoint slides he is gonna fire me. How the fuck did I end up at this shit show?. Also the CEO is a moonlighting idiot, he rarely cares about this startup and does his 2nd job all the time. Recently he hired some interns to setup his mining server lol.\n\nOh by the way I get paid 1500$ per month lol (yep in a shitty 3rd world country).\n\nHow can I save my career ? How do I make an exit? How bad is my future gonna look when it says I left a company after 9 months. This is also my first job after college. Please Dear senior CSE, guide me. \n\nThanks.",

UVA certainly has a good CS program but for AI/ML specifically, it\u2019s a bit lacking.

You submit a report on how your contributions to Google helped it and why you should be promoted. Now this committee has never seen your work before and decides whether you should be promoted based on the application. But not everything is quantifiable, like how someone helped his teammates or made documentation for legacy project, etc. These things do not really have well defined metrics. So I believe there are many who work at FAANG but are not promoted easily. They are stuck at the same level for quit a few years.\n\nOn the other hand, companies like Stripe, or startups, etc, although may not provide similar benefits like FAANG, but due to their relatively smaller teams provide better communication among members. This does not mean easy promotion but this also does not mean that individual contributions are not noticeable.\n\nSo my doubt is, if I work at a big tech company for say 4-5 years but with no or just one promotion, then decide to quit and look for job at some other company, is the absence of promotion going to hurt my chances to get a job even though I used to work at the big tech company?\n\nOr if I work at startup, get a few promotions, and then look for job elsewhere, is that better?\n\nNow I am not saying big companies don't promote. One could argue that if one is competent enough company will promote that person. It is just that, since I haven't yet experienced working at a company, I don't know if the competent thing really plays that big of a role in real world or does show business has its role to play too.",

Is the price difference really worth it?\n\nEdit 2: I think I've made up my mind. GA Tech it is. It has a very good program, the material is great, the brand name is very good, and the cost is great. You have access to a wide network given you meet other people who are also in the program. I don't care about the fact that many people have it, recruiters are still impressed by GA Tech, and hiring managers who are too dumb to like another university just because it's a higher price tag and less people pay for it are not worth working for anyways. \n\nBonus question: I am having a hard time choosing between all the specializations.

        "body": "Hello. This is a question/rant at myself.\n\nI have 3 semesters left (including this one) before graduating. Since college started, I've been trying to land an internship. I spread myself too thin trying to learn a lot of skills needed by the internships I find. I finally managed to interview once and I passed a technical interview but I sucked at the \"management\" interview (the one where they ask you behavioural questions) so I was rejected (they didn't tell me the reason, I just assumed that it's the management interview because it came after the technical one).\n\nIt's frustrating. Every internship requires a different set of skills (at least the ones in my country) and I always feel like my skills and projects aren't enough. Right now, my resume has many skills but I'm not really good in most of them, if I had to use them I will need to review and learn more about them.\n\nMeanwhile, I sort of neglected studying college subjects, telling myself I'll learn them later, but I now regret it. Maybe if I focused on studying the core CS subjects and did a decent project in each of them, I would have more opportunities when I graduate (e.g., be ready to do a master's).\n\nBut I'm still not sure if I should focus the time I have left solely on that or if I should still try to pursue internships. I think initially my desire to find an internship was a dumb one. I think it was along the lines of \"I want to be like Mark Zuckerberg\" or something. I thought I was special just because I started programming at 10 but boy was I wrong. Because of my humongous ego, I made a lot of bad decisions. I kept comparing myself to my colleagues who started interning or freelancing, one of them even worked as a full-fledged SWE in multiple companies!\n\nAnother reason of why I was rushing things so much is because of my anxiety that my chances of finding a job after I graduate will be very low without an internship. A lot of the companies I've seen are either looking for interns or senior devs.\n\nSo right now, I'm confused. I want to know if my fear is justified and if there's a rational reason people pursue internships during college. Right now, the only thing I can think of is money and experience. I need both but more importantly I need knowledge. I don't want to call myself an engineer if I don't have good grasp on these topics (I'm talking about OS, databases, distributed systems, even compilers).\n\n**TL;DR** I wasted a lot of time trying to land an internship but never did. Now I have 2.5 semesters left and I want to know if there's a merit in pursuing an internship or if I should just focus on college.\n\n**Edit** Some details about me:\n\n* I'm from Egypt\n* 2.7 GPA\n* I don't mind working in non-FAANG, in fact I've seen better working environments than FAANG\n* I would prefer living and working in a different country, if my job affords me to\n* I will probably need to work a while after graduating because I can't afford a Master's unless it's a scholarship or something",

I'm not sure what steps to take here, but hopefully, someone can shed light.\n\nMy approach (please correct me if this is not the right way to tackle it):\n\n1, I believe the smartest thing to do right now is to get a TN by becoming a Canadian Citizen.  AFAIk, you only do TN for as long as you can\u2019t get H1B. Good thing is TN can be extended \u201cindefinitely\u201d in 3-year increments, so as a Canadian, you can still work there as long as it takes to get H1B.

Apply for H1B while working as a TN, I think I'm stuck with one employer with H1B and I might not be able to switch jobs during the time period.\n\n3. Get Green card because of H1B\n\n4.

And it seems like they outsource these roles because it's impossible for them to find someone to agree to get hired as an internal employee, and work on such projects.\n* While working for the client, there's a constant feeling of 'detachment', they expect the external developer to be involved with the team and project, but the truth is that he's merely a tourist there, and he can be laid off in 24 hours for reasons like budget issues or team organization. \n* Indian consulting companies keep taking the rates down, which makes it very hard to negotiate a decent salary raise in the future.   \n\n\nThis is my first time working for a consulting company, because in the past I worked only for companies that build and sell software(as internal developer).

Looking for suggestions on whether to take my career path towards MLE vs SWE vs PM\n\nHi! To provide some context, I'm currently an NLP applied scientist. I chose this job because I wanted to get into ML -- however, working with almost all PhDs my imposter syndrome is going through the roof. Also, I've never been very strong in math, I somehow got through college and my masters taking no math classes lol, but my current job assumes a strong basis in linear algebra. I am working in research but I don't like it -- I find it difficult to write papers and come up with new solutions to existing problems. \n\nWhy MLE: I think ML problems are super interesting, but my current AS role is very research focused.  I want to move out of this to hopefully something further away and closer to prod (i.e. what I think is the MLE role). Would my lack of math background be my Achille's heel here as well?\n\nWhy SWE: I did pass HC at Google for SWE a year ago when I was fresh out of college (though I chose not to go b/c of the opportunities in ML) and made it into some other companies, so I think that my interviewing skills for SWE are not too bad. If I will have imposter syndrome forever as long as I'm in ML, going to SWE may not be a bad idea. Another plus is that I enjoy coding.\n\nWhy PM: Honestly not too sure of what the day-to-day of a PM looks like. However, I've actually grew up interested in humanities since I was a child until the middle of college (was always an aspiring writer/journalist), so I think that public speaking and writing are some of my bigger strengths I have that I am unable to use as an engineer. Though I enjoy it, I do not necessarily think coding needs to be part of my job (though I do want to stay in tech) and I think that my past experience in ML and my strengths in writing/speaking may be a plus.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

Completed a bootcamp and landed my first junior software dev role a month ago, during my interview I asked about onboarding and training, I was told there would be training.\n\nI got hired at a small start up with a dev team consisting of 3 other people: 1 software architect and 2 other junior devs. The company\u2019s goal is to build a complex social media platform from scratch within 4 months. This first job has been absolute hell. \n\nMy onboarding process was to code a calculator in 4 days using a language and library I have never used before. My code for the calculator was never reviewed lol but the software architect believes that was enough training to now build strong working features for this platform. The problem is the SA has created a toxic environment where questions are answered with sarcasm and condescending tones. There is no structure, no documentation, the SA has no interest and no time to mentor me or spend time going over expectations. The SA is building the platform how he wants so all the code structure lives in his head and he doesn\u2019t particularly care to take time and explain anything to us. I understand he\u2019s in a shitty position where he has to build this huge platform singlehandedly with 3 Junior devs who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\n\nHe\u2019s been in the industry for 20 years and somehow expects us Junior devs to be able to pick up on his code quickly and churn out tickets in these sprints. Some of the tickets are beyond my scope of knowledge or skill. Whenever we have company meetings he always says \u201cI encourage my devs to ask questions\u201d and when I do ask questions it\u2019s met with hostility and impatience, and some rude comments about how annoying I am.\n\nHe spends a lot of time trolling me or the 2 other Junior devs when we take long to complete a ticket or he straight up tries to humiliate me and other juniors during our dev meetings if we make mistakes. He has literally given me an eye roll emoji as feedback. If I try and stand up for myself and explain I am new and still learning, it makes him troll even harder. I don\u2019t feel I am being given the grace to be a Junior dev and to make mistakes without fear of consequence and to learn in a safe environment. I feel like I\u2019m being set up for failure rather than success. I am not looking to be spoon-fed or have my hand held but this has been 4 weeks of insanity. I\u2019m tired of feeling like an incompetent dev, because of the lack of support and structure.\n\nI don\u2019t have a HR department and this is really taking a toll on my mental health. I am stressed all of the time, my anxiety is at an all time high, I can\u2019t ask for help without fear of being judged and ridiculed. I am constantly made to feel stupid. After speaking with peers I realize this is not a normal experience for a Junior dev. I\u2019m trying to stick it out so it doesn\u2019t look bad on my resume but I don\u2019t think I can last much longer in this demoralizing environment. \n\n I don\u2019t know if this is a \u201cgrass is greener on the other side\u201d moment.

This sub is bigger, and I feel I'll get more advice here than in a more focused sub.\n\nI graduated two years ago, no job applications put out, but I've been trying to force myself to get the hang of web and app development; basically because it's like a foundation for security. I assumed if I want to secure apps, it's best I first know how to build them, but I have no flare for web & mobile app development anymore. It's like I'm forcing myself to do something I'm not interested in. I used to like development a decade ago, but somewhere along the line the passion for it died. I can read code and understand it to an extent and research what I don't, but I don't have that drive to build any sort of web or app-store type mobile app. \n\nInstead of wasting years on a skill I'm not interested in, I'm thinking of diving into the pool I'm truly interested in; security. To be specific, the technical side of it. I'm interested in pentesting, injections, building and understanding scripts/malwares/ITSec-tools, cryptography (love maths), and bug hunting. \n\n- What other technical paths/titles can I pursue in the security field? I'm not really interested in the theories of information & cyber security, but I will read up on theories that I need to. But from going through the security subs, I saw majority of the field rarely works with code. They do so mostly to create tools only. \n\n- Another thing that holds me from going into the general cyber/network security space and kept me trying to master app and web development is freelancing. I'm not really one that enjoys office weekdays 9-5 working. That's more reason why I like penetration testing. I can work from home or as a contractor. So I would like job roles that can allow me freelance or work part time and/or remotely.\n\nBasically, I'm tired of forcing myself to get the hang of web and app development; front end, back end, frameworks, etc. I'm tired of all that - it's annoying just to type and think about. Maybe because of how crowded and diluted the field is, to me. Either way, no desire comes from those topics. I want to transition into something still technical, but not a front-end/back-end based development type job. I loved my cryptography course in school, although hard, it was a challenge I enjoyed. I know I'll love everything technical about cyber & network security. What are my options and paths (especially foundation) please?",

I do have one company, let's call it 'B' where I cleared all rounds(total of 3) and waiting for the decision this coming week, my question is, if the company agrees to extend an offer hopefully, should I mention them about the offer that I have and try to negotiate for a 70k compensation package. \n\nThe average glassdoor review or new grad salary in company B is 67k, a little background about B, I really like the company and the stack that I am gonna work, but they don't provide sponsorship and I am fine with it. I strongly believe I can work there for a few months and find a job that do provide sponsorship within the end of the year. I say this because, I've been constantly applying, for months now and have fair bit of interview experience, and am financially constrained at this point to not have a job. I am not going to stop applying or interviewing in both the cases of these jobs but just wanted to make I'm thinking straight. Appreciate any help or suggestions, thank you.\n\n\nUpdate (edit) -  Got offer from B and negotiated a starting compensation of 70k+ benefits :D\n\nThank you everyone who replied to my post, really appreciate it.",

        "body": "Hi,\n\nI've joined a AI research team in a big company (transitioning internally) about a year and a half ago, and got quickly promoted to project leader of a software project that is supposed to help our research team. It makes sense from the team point-of-view because I'm the only person who could have taken that role given my experience (more real SWE experience, and also experienced working in research).\n\nRecently a brainstorming with the research team basically oriented the project toward a data processing project, which again makes sense from the team's point of view. However, for me it's depressing, I've joined the team because I'm truly passionate about ML research (although I don't have a PhD), I haven't touched a DL training for almost a year now, and this new orientation makes me think that I won't for a while.\n\nI'm still young (29y) and even tho I understand that I'm the most qualified for this role, I don't think it's the best way I can expend my career (I'm not THAT technically experienced, most of my decisions are just educated guess and take time plan, I don't have any mentoring, I'm mostly managing interns and juniors).\n\nI also don't think so far that this promotion got converted into title / financial raise (still not senior, even tho I've always been top contributor, and my colleague who stayed in SWE team already got promoted, and because I didn't get promoted my raise last year were imho pretty low).\n\nI'm thinking about asking for a demotion to get back into research (I do think this team is exceptionally good in AI research, so I would prefer not to move).\n\nIs this a suicidal move career-wise? Is there a better solution?\n\nOur raise process is announced in June, I should get promoted senior there (I'm not sure about how much raise), should I wait for it before doing anything?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated.",

Mostly using asp.net and c# as my chosen career. \n\nAs far as my job history goes I've only ever worked for two companies. My first job I was an intern and eventually was hired as a junior. The team was abusive and had a weird power complex situation going on, so I left after 4 years. Plus the company had been dangling the carrot oh money for a while. \n\nThis lead me to my current venture. I'm working for a marketing company and handling five projects that are core operations for the company. I am handling these ony own. I'm the only developer that works on these projects. There are two other devs working in their own projects as well. There isn't a lot of learning or anyone to help guide me career wise, but the culture is phenomenal. Needless to say, I can't grow like I should on my own. \n\nThis lands me on the phone with HR from a new company. I aced the interviews after a year of being told I wasn't good enough for positions, after having interviews with big companies like Microsoft, after being told I'm still junior level and after 6 years that's really bad. I'm taking a position as a lead software engineer with my new company at a 6 figure salary. Under the guidance of a team of 5 engineers as part of a bigger team of 18 engineers. I'm flabbergasted.\n\nIn the words of Rocky:\n\nLet me tell you something you already know. The world ain\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows. It\u2019s a very mean and nasty place, and I don\u2019t care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain\u2019t about how hard you hit. It\u2019s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That\u2019s how winning is done! Now, if you know what you\u2019re worth, then go out and get what you\u2019re worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain\u2019t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain\u2019t you.

And I have many personal projects because of FOMO. \n\nJob:\nI was able to land a developer job right out of school and I asked for a cool 45k because i was getting in person interviews but always rejections so i made myself a bargain, mostly because i like to code, solve problems and make stuff. \n\nThey gave me a starting TC of $65. After my first performance review, where i thought i was being fired, they gave me a raise to TC $78k.\n\nAfter my second, TC of $110k.\n\nMy manager and CTO have said i do good work and i mostly think that\u2019s because i\u2019m just faster than all the consultants (bc im full time of course) as getting products or features to testing and deployment. \n\nQuestion:\nBut how much further will this go? Am i in a position to ask for a raise when they have literally doubled my TC in less than two years? I am very bad at reading people\u2019s emotions and sentiment towards me, which is why after my boss talks in a negative tone i feel like i\u2019m about to get fired, but i think they are generally happy with me. \nI really like working there, and i would like to stay at least until my stuff vests but year two is approaching and i feel like it\u2019s up or out here. I don\u2019t think i can pass some hard core leet code questions, seeing how in this interview they asked me \u201cwhat do you like to do on the weekends\u201d and simple tech questions. \n\nI\u2019m afraid asking for a raise will hurt, I\u2019m not in Frisco, but housing is expensive and I will have to move out soon but i can only afford to live further away from the office (since were returning later this year most likely) and my current commute is about 1-1.5 hours and after working from home I don\u2019t think i want to make that commute. Even though i only live 15 miles from the office.\n\nTL;DR\nI have a liberal arts degree and they have doubled my salary in less than two years. I will need a raise to rent close to the office and not have all my income be directed towards housing.

Last 10 years in a telecom/tech company mostly focused on critical environments and automation (think data centres, etc.). Looking to move into a different part of the company focused on either AI or emerging tech or products/services. I have 3 leads/interviews and wanted to get your thoughts on the pros/cons. Assume salary is same for all the positions and they are all internal transfers. Also, all are manager positions with direct reports.\n\n1. Manage a team of data scientists, software engineers, systems analysts, and business analysts spread over 3 countries to optimize and scale an AI and ML based program to reduce operating costs of the company. So in other words, automate and digitize internal processes and even customer facing troubleshooting (currently done by techs). Team is highly technical, competent, and experienced but lacks direction, role definition, and structure.\n2. Manage a team of business analysts, project managers, and program managers to identify emerging disruptive technologies in smart building and smart cities space for M&A or strategic partnership opportunities. Work is primarily focused on identification and evaluation of technologies and companies so it is pseudo technical with some business analysis. Team would be built from ground up as it is a very entrepreneurial start up environment. \n3. Manage a team of business analysts and product experts to manage product assurance after launch. So this deals with ensuring that my team works with product owners and analytic teams to develop roadmaps, strategies, and tools to increase product assurance for the end customer (general public). This includes physical and digital products (up to 20 product lines).",

In this team I\u2019ve heard some feedback that I am not moving fast enough, that\u2019s because I let myself doing nothing from time to time, it is not good and I am working on it.\n\nThe salary is good for the place, for my region and my experience, it is adjusted to the local market. Recently I\u2019ve met a team of a startup from other country, that offered remote + literally x3 raise due to lower taxes and their market salaries for my experience. The figures are not high for their market but great for mine. Tasks also seem very challenging, and here is my imposter syndrome starts doing it\u2019s job.\n\nThere is nothing to discuss about figures, they just pay a lot. The only thing that I\u2019m concerned about is that there is a risk that in a few months startup will fire me (if I will not be able to move fast enough and work hard enough) or it can lose their money or anything else can happen, it\u2019s a startup at the end. In this case I will not be able to return to my current team and probably the company that I really like. Actually, I do like my current team and it definitely will give me some precious experience if I remain here, but they will not match this offer (and even wouldn\u2019t try because I am the new guy at the team with no significant results yet).\n\nI\u2019m asking this sub to give advice on the situation and approaches to make the decision!",

Then I went back to college as a research assistant and took out 20k in debt and quit because my car broke down and I told myself i wasn't learning anything and I hated being in school for nothing. I drive for Uber and it is getting old I've been doing it for 9 months the pay has been pretty good but is sort of unreliable long term. I want to build a career and not go through some bullshit company that sells me at a huge markup. I applied to 5 internships and kind of doubt I'll hear back I've heard back from like 3 places in the 2-300 places I applied to since graduating. Are there just a glut of CS majors? I bombed an interview at Amazon because my car just died and I was depressed because I had to leave my ra position. I should've rescheduled the interview because I could've studied the technical stuff some more but when they asked me about how hashmaps store stuff I had no idea so that really hurt me I think. They don't teach algorithms to computer engineering majors at my school. Anyways, what should I do? My brothers a senior software engineer and he's been trying to start a small company with me but wants to work on stuff I have no experience in, I finally feel ready to try taking software seriously again it's just hard to start a company and I think an internship or job might be better for me right now.",

I am planning to find job to cities like Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal as there are lot of opportunities. However, I heard from few previous grads, it is difficult to get interviews as companies prefer local candidates to avoid relocating perks or some other reasons. So some people use local address of their friends or family to avoid being filtered as outsiders. As I will be actively looking for jobs next couple of months, I am wondering which way to follow (use my current address or use friends address ). Any information regarding using a fake address and how can I avoid using fake address without getting filtered will be much appreciated.",

There are university and college courses offered here but A Cloud Guru caught my eye. I was wondering if there is anyone from Toronto or anywhere in Canada who undergone the process? I really want to become and member and start learning but I'm worried if Canadian companies don't acknowledge A Cloud Guru as a credible program. I've also asked people from LinkedIn specifically about ACG and no one has answered it directly.\n\nAnother question I have is are there any specific career path or hierarchy in this field? I'm looking to research its entry jobs and where it can branch to so I can keep tabs on what I should study in order to grow. So far, I've seen [this](https://www.findcareerinfo.com/cloud-computing-career-path/#Cloud_Computing_Career_Paths) but I haven't seen a job tree like on PayScale.\n\nThank you so much! :)",
