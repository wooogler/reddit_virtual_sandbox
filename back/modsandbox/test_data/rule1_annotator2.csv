15,nci7bm,Shipwreck-Siren,Is there any way to find overlaps between non-IT/CS experience and the experience required for IT/CS jobs in order to qualify to apply for them?,"I'm currently in a state government job that I'm miserable in and I'm reaching my breaking point. I have a B.S. in Economics. I've been considering a switch to tech and am working through CS50 and then want to move onto other certifications for Linux, Networking, Systems Admin, etc. Almost every entry-level job that I'm finding is negotiable on degree and certificates, but usually requires at least 1-2 years of experience in IT settings. I know that for many jobs you can find overlaps between experience and get interviewed and even hired without having direct experience. I'm wondering if this is true for IT/CS? I saw this job posted with the state and I'm wondering if any of my experience can be applied. Is saying that I'm working through CS50 enough? What kind of non-IT/CS experience can qualify for the information security field? I feel like a lot of my current experience as a labor market analyst can meet similarities with the other duties, but I don't have direct experience in an IT setting. I've tried writing scripts to make my tasks more efficient in the little time that I have and started learning Linux last year before the pandemic started. I would like to at least try to apply but asking if you have that experience is an initial qualifier/disqualifier. I feel like I'm trapped because of how little I can devote to my certificates/training around this full-time job and it is DRAINING me after 3 years. I'm trying to stay in some level of public sector work so that makes my options more limited.

16,nci3mb,courtois26,Prospects for STEM PhD dropout going into Industry,"I am currently pursuing a PhD in maths at a top school in the US. However, this might not be the correct path for me, since I don't have the passion for research and academic pursuit that my peers have. Therefore, dropping out and getting a CS (or Finance) job has become a serious consideration for me.

I'm currently finishing up my 2nd year, so ideally I would apply for jobs and dropout before the end of my 3rd year, since I don't want to dropout without an offer already. What do you all think my prospects are? ***I'm specially worried*** that companies won't want me because they might think: ""this person has no perseverance since they committed to a PhD but ended up dropping it"" or ""this person is too dumb for us since they couldn't even exit their PhD program with a Masters"". Is there a standard way of saying you're planning to dropout (in your resum√© or during interviews) without sounding like a quitter?

If you are wondering, here is a bit more about my background. I did by undergrad in pure math at a top school in the US and went straight to my current PhD program after that. ***I have no internships*** or previous experience (in CS or finance) except for a quantitative trading internship this summer at a top firm. My coding is decent (Python and C++, I can do LeetCode or CodeForces problems) but I don't have any projects to prove it.

I've been researching for a few hours and I haven't really gotten anywhere in regards to the most efficient way I should be learning. When I originally taught myself about wine I spent way too much time learning things that weren't relevant at all, like maximum residual sugar levels of obscure wine regions. I want to make sure I don't make that type of mistake again, and it seems easy considering how many free resources are out there.  


Potentially relevant information:

* I have no college degree, but I did spend some time attending a tech school for IT-Networking.
* I'm technologically inclined. I have a relatively firm understanding of how operating systems work and how to utilize some technical features. 
* I don't have a history of being very good at math, but that could be due to the quality and/or lack of teaching on the subject. 
* I have a lot of free time.  


Questions I have:

* My brother is an IT Director and therefor has friends in the industry, but too busy to answer many questions. From a brief interaction I was told my career path depends on what ""stack"" I want to learn, and whether or not I want to work on the design or engineering side. **What is the most widely desired ""stack""?**
* I don't want to necessarily limit myself on my journey through education by focusing on either engineering vs. design, but... **Which ""type of programming"" is more in demand with the greatest potential of growth?**
* **What should my path of education look like, including examples to use in my resume/job interviews that compensates for the lack of degree?**
* **What kind of entry-level jobs could I expect with the education that is recommended to me by you, including pay range?**
* If it's possible to answer, **What does an average day look like for you?**
* **Is remote-work significantly more common, and will it remain that way for the foreseeable future?**

136,nbhjy2,MrSirDuckDude,Struggling to secure a software engineering job with my mostly self-taught background and looking for advice,"TL;DR: I've been transitioning to programming just from my own self-studying and guidance from my mentor, and I just wanted to get some feedback since I've been getting very antsy about securing a job. I have about 8 months of informal experience working with JavaScript/React, although I've been doing an internship for a month so far at a brand new start-up working on the MVP for a React chat app. Can I get a full-time (ideally tech) job with this kind of background? Any tips on how I can make that happen? I do have a mechanical engineering degree and some years of experience there, but yeah trying to switch to coding, which so far I like a lot better.

Full background:

I started learning JavaScript basics at the beginning of 2020 to get ready for a coding boot camp, but then the whole pandemic thing happened and I felt less inclined to do the boot camp's remote program. Fortunately, I had a close friend who's a Software Engineer and also had prior experience teaching at a boot camp, and he offered to teach me personally as my mentor. He put together his own curriculum tailored for me based on what he thought would be most beneficial, starting with some cs fundamentals, then more web fundamentals, and then finally putting together an actual web application with React. I spent a lot of time building it under his guidance, really making sure to have a polished final product for my portfolio and resume (you can check it out here if you like: [https://www.rolemate.io](https://www.rolemate.io/jobs))

With that experience, I was fortunately able to get a Software Engineering internship at a startup, where we're working on the very early stages of an app creating the MVP for a social app. It's been pretty good React experience as well as I've been working on new features with the guidance of the Senior Software Engineer.

And of course, I've also been practicing with algorithms (my least favorite part) with an online course and just grinding away on different problems and mock interviews. This part is probably my weakest area and I'm still struggling to get solutions consistently.

And that's pretty much where I'm at. I've been sending out a BUNCH of applications but haven't gotten a single response besides the internship. Is there any hope for me with my unconventional background?? I'd appreciate any feedback and insights!",1620915118,t3_nbhjy2,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nbhjy2/struggling_to_secure_a_software_engineering_job/,40,330,3,1541194639,1,1,MrSirDuckDude
138,nbhdse,ougly,Late 20s woman looking for advice on switching careers into CS,"Hi all, 

&#x200B;

I've always had an interest in programming but for whatever reason didn't go to school for it. I think when I was younger I just didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and it was hard to choose from all the options available to me. Also, I was terrible at school and ended up dropping out anyway. It's not that I'm dumb, I've just always found it hard to focus in school. I may have some undiagnosed ADHD and other illnesses that I'm going to therapy for now though. 

&#x200B;

Currently I work for a company as their sole Tech Support person. I'm feeling really burnt out lately and realized I don't want to do this for the rest of my life. I'm looking into either going back to school or attending a bootcamp. I'm not sure what to pick. 

&#x200B;

* If I went to a university I'd have to take out a loan (if even possible with my credit score). I'm planning on buying a house soon so that will probably drop my score even more. Not sure if that affects getting school loans at all. 
* I suck at math. Are there any CS degrees with less complex math or are they all kinda the same? I will 100% try to apply myself regardless but... yea. 
* What remote-learning schools do people recommend?
* What bootcamps do people recommend/have had success from? Did you have any prior education before the bootcamp?

No prior CS experience, but I'm looking to make the switch to software engineering. I've been taking CE courses for a bit over a year now with the goal of getting a software engineering certification from the university I'm attending.

Everything I've learned so far in the 3-4 classes I've taken has been restricted to a single coding language. I've chosen Python. I've come a long way and it's been a challenge getting as far as I have. I'm confident in my Python skills and know that I can program pretty much anything the language allows me to if I can do a bit of research. 

But then I go to look for requirements for entry-level software engineers. And programming in a single language is 1/10th of the requirements they're looking for. Most want you to be familiar with full-stack design. Comfortable in multiple languages. Familiar with both scripting and compiled languages. Proficient in databases. Networking. Familiar with a bunch of third-party tools that I've never heard of like WireShark or SoapUI.

It's so incredibly demotivating. It feels like I spent the last year and a half checking off ONE of TEN boxes that employers want in an entry-level employee. Is this normal?

Most students in my program do the 2 semesters of post-bac classes and then 2 semesters of masters level classes before pursuing an internship but I was anxious to start getting some enterprise experience before deciding what the focus of my masters degree would be so I pursued an internship earlier and very fortunately received an offer at what seems to be a cool company with decent compensation. 

My programming skills are fairly good but I have spent little time immersed in the CS world so I am not sure what to be looking for in a job. I am of course grateful to receive an offer at all but I am curious what kind of skills I can expect to build and how marketable they might make me in the future based on this job description.

They are growing rapidly and would like to standardize the development process across teams and projects. To this end, they are developing an app using Microsoft Dynamics 365. I would be working on this project helping to create a suite of tools to aid the development process. During the course of my internship, they said I would gain experience in the following:

\- Using windows power apps

\- Working on the low-code side

\- Working on the JavaScript side

\- Creating high-code solutions

\- Creating documentation to aid in the standardization of the development process

214,nauo77,Professional_Ebb9382,Wealthy NonCS Candidates Getting Top Software Engineering Jobs,"Hi,

So I am low income, first generation about to graduate with a CS BS and the interview market has hit hard. I have a 3.9 GPA from a top 50 CS school and have prepped well but it seems like CS was just a huge waste of time.

I go on LinkedIN and see all of these ""software engineers"" at these top companies and all I see is that they studied at top 10 schools studied a major completely abstract something like Industrial Engineer, Physics, Biology, even seen Art, and I'm assuming that they could not find jobs in their majors so they instead go into the software engineer route. They suddenly go from being a Masters + PhD in biology to a software engineer at FAANG within a year and in a way it frustrates me to know that these wealthy candidates only got into these top companies because they can afford to buy the resources, all the coursera courses they want, pay for a bootcamp, or CS MS, it's truthfully unfair.

I know I shouldn't judge but I truly am passionate about CS and to see wealthy candidates with no passion for CS (otherwise why wouldn't it be their undergrad?) switching to Software Engineering at FAANG companies immediately within a year through different means (e.g. references, family, wealth, buying resources, etc) and get in without having to even study CS is simply unfair.

How do you guys feel about this? I feel like CS should just be removed completely, feels like I wasted 4 years where someone who is in a completely irrelevant major can just switch into a top paying FAANG job in 6 months.

I know it might seem that it is a little bit late, but I suddenly realized that I don‚Äôt want to study business and marketing anymore. Besides, it will be hard to find a job in this field. However, there are a lot of job opportunities for those who have a degree in computer sciences.

&#x200B;

I realized that the employment market is quite competitive at the moment, and it‚Äôs hard to find a job with my degree. There is tough competition even for a place in an unpaid internship. I have no idea why did I choose this pathway. My parents don‚Äôt have their own business, compared to some of my classmates. I think back in time, I applied for something that might be easier for me. Now, I feel like I‚Äôve wasted my time and money. Perhaps, I shouldn‚Äôt have studied economics, and maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have even noticed my epic mistake.

&#x200B;

I see that my mates from my dorm, that study IT, already found some part-time jobs in their field, and they are just in their 2nd year of study. They‚Äôve learned everything at college, and now they can make some good money on what they‚Äôve learned. While I‚Äôm struggling to find an unpaid internship with my degree, I will graduate with honors if I do good on my finals.

&#x200B;

When I look for some jobs online, I see that almost every company requires an IT specialist and pays good money. While there are no offers for business and marketing graduates. I‚Äôve reached that point when everyone needs some work experience, but no one wants to hire me so I can get one. This situation became so ridiculous, so I even found a meme based on it.

258,nacopg,renoreaper,Struggling to switch from tech consulting to software dev,"Hi All,

First post here, apologies if anything isn't in order.

I wanted to get some input/opinions on my situation from all the good folks here, as I've been trying to make this switch for a while now. Here's my situation:


- background/backstory (feel free to skip)
I'm in my early thirties, have worked almost a decade in tech consulting (implementing/configuring SQL-based tools for things like sales management and accounting). In that time I worked mostly as an individual contributor, with a few years as lead consultant for some bigger projects (switched back to single contributor after a mini-burn out and deciding that being in meetings/writing email all day wasn't for me).

I studied computer science in college back in Europe (about a decade ago) and am currently living and working in Toronto, Canada in consulting for a large organization (I actually quite like the company, I started here about 2 years ago, they have decent benefits/pay, though lately things have been changing slightly for the worse I find).

- challenge/goal:
I would want to switch to software development, my degree focused on this moreso, but due to circumstances and emigrating I kind of ended up in consulting. I'm finding it particularly challenging to find time/motivation to do side projects and coding after a full day at work (and I probably have some covid fatigue I think, measures downtown toronto have long been quite strict). In terms of prior coding experience: I got a Java certification a few years back and I have played around with  variety of language (Python, Java, C#, Cobol, Javascript etc.), but I find I'm lacking in recent and real world experience (as well as some of the supporting tools and technologies, things like Kubernetes or getting fully up to speed with AWS/Azure and microservice architecture).

I've spent the last few years thinking about making the switch, but have always come up lacking on the execution and I REALLY want to change that. However, I also know that doing this as a side project after work every day is quite likely to fail. For this reason I was thinking of enrolling in one of the coding bootcamps available here, they're quite pricey but I think it might be the fastest/surest way for me to get into a dev role sooner rather than later, which will ultimately help with me develop the required skills further (I like/enjoy studying and learning as part of a job and think I'm quite good at it). My question is what would you do in my situation? Any specific suggestions/ideas or any glaring oversights/flaws that you see with my approach? Also: any experience (attending or hiring from) any of the specific coding bootcamps in Toronto is also most welcome!

Thanks all,

392,n99c59,SageTG,Non-CS Grad Seeking Guidance for Career Path,"I am looking to enter the Software Development scene. I have my BBA in Marketing, but originally wanted to get a degree in CS however this never happened due to my lack of knowledge of how college really worked (First Gen Graduate). I got my general undergrad coursework done at a local community college and then transferred to a state college, during this process I found out that if I wanted to get a degree in CS, that I would basically have to retake much of my general coursework as it was going to require that I get much of the foundational coursework done despite already having my associate degree. So essentially I was looking at going to school for another 3-4 years to get a CS degree vs continuing with a business degree in 2 years. Due to financial/time constraints, I went the BBA route (and highly regret this decision).

Two years ago I graduated with my BBA and have been unable to find anything professionally in the field. I am about to turn 25 years old and am feeling like if I want to make a career/field change, now is the time to do it. It doesn't help I'm not really interested in Marketing, but I am interested in software dev as I feel that it would be much more in my spectrum of interests and fit me as a person better. I have a little self-taught knowledge of python/html/css/js, but nothing significant enough to gain employment. My hope would be to utilize something of my Marketing degree, potentially the UX/UI knowledge that I gained during my studies.

Just some background info: I am married and my wife and I both have income, I would be able to work part-time and attend school/camp if the opportunity arose. She makes enough income to support us both if necessary for a period of time. I live in Arkansas, while there are not a vast amount of employment opportunities in my city, we live pretty close to Little Rock which has some SE jobs posted pretty regularly, though we would be willing to move if necessary. 

My question is this, what would be the best route in my case to reach employment in the SE field?

1.) I have been accepted to my local community college for pursuing a second bachelor in CS, my situation is similar to when I was in college the first go around, I will require all of the foundational classes and since this would be my second bachelor, I would be paying out of pocket/getting loans to pay. Either way, I assume it would be helpful to take some of the intro to CS classes there.

2.) Should I seek a masters degree in CS? There is a college here that offers a ""Master of Computer and Information Science"" degree online and though it prefers students who have a CS background, it does allow for non-cs majors to apply after taking a couple of pre-req courses. This option seems like a good choice, but I get unsure when I consider the fact that I most likely will be lacking a lot of the core foundational knowledge of CS.

3.) I've also considered attending a coding camp though I am a little weary of them. I've looked into Hack Reactor/App Academy/Coding Dojo. I like the idea of getting instant industry applicable skills, but I've also heard/seen some sort of shady stuff with some of the Bootcamps. I also wouldn't be able to lump sum pay for something like this so would need to consider the different financing options.

Wow, this post ended up a lot longer than I had hoped for, my apologies, and thank you for your input!

I am so lost and would really appreciate any advice that you all can give me.

Let's get the basics out of the way first. 

I am now 28 years old and have not been in school for about 7 years now. I have only been working in dead end jobs like being a cashier at target and McDonald's for a long time now. I'm very depressed from the poor decisions I have made in life and am yearning to make a change for the better this time.

So, fast forward to today. I've come to understand and believe that the tech industry will be the future and have some of the best paying jobs out there. I've been reading that there are three different paths to take in breaking into a career in this field. Getting a college degree in computer science, being self taught, or going by way of bootcamps. 

The college route seems like it may be a safer route (correct me if I'm wrong, please), but it also seems like it will cost the most time and money to do so. I have completed some education at my community college many years ago. I mapped out a potential plan with a college counselor, and it would take me 3 years to finish my time at community college, then transfer to a university, which would take another 2 years to finally achieve my bachelor's degree in computer science. That's 5 years in total, PROVIDED that I am able to pass every single class that I take.

417,n8yvrf,changexd,Where should I go now as a backend Developer?,"Hello guys, I am a self-taught web developer, I started learning front-end at the end of last year, I've landed two jobs as a front-end dev with REACT, both of the jobs were really bad(on the company policy part, one of them was against my rights), after those two jobs, I soon realized I am more interested in the backend development, so after quitting, I studied a month of basic backend knowledge and then landed an internship as a backend engineer in a start-up.

During the internship, though my position was called ""backend engineer"", but my duty was actually using AWS CDK to do IAC for our service, I had a great time learning cloud services and knowledge about internet, and the crew was really nice to me. But because of the company's lack of budget, they had to let go all the devs including me. After this short but awesome experience, I was almost certain that I want to be a backend Dev in the future, so I started to develop my own side project.  I am an admin in an English study group and we hold events every week, I decided to created a web app to optimize the registration process so I started develop it with something I haven't tried out yet. 

Right now the first version of my app is done on the backend, but because of my friend (she's in charge of UI designing), my side project is not ready to be deployed yet, so I thought maybe I could demonstrate my backend code and get into the job market.

After a week of browsing and applying some of the junior jobs, I feel a bit frustrated, I feel like I suit most of the junior job and still feel like I don't. I really don't know what should I do now, should I keep searching for the job? or should I learn something else? 

If I should learn something else, where should I go? should I keep optimizing my backend service, or just keep learning new things? My friend always tells me to ""master"" one thing, and I honestly don't know where to start, I am currently learning data structures, CS knowledges and algorithms when I am not searching for jobs, is that sufficient? I've been considering maybe getting a AWS certificate, but I really don't know if it helps since $150 is quite expensive for me at the moment..

487,n8bais,boxthrow101,Moving away from traditional engineering into tech.,"Hi everyone.

I've just graduated from uni with a mech eng. degree and have just started my grad role at one of the top construction companies here in Australia.

After the past 4 months or so I've come to realise that the work here is definitely not aligned to my skills, interests and passions. The work is more project management based and hasn't really allowed me to delve into technical/analysis work which has led to me looking into software/tech as a potential career change. That being said my salary is above average for a graduate engineer, given the workload will become more intense as I progress.

After enrolling and making progress on a beginner Python course from Udemy (which I've been really enjoying) I've been heavily considering my options on how to make this potential transition.

I've dm'd a few individuals within this community regarding this, and have gotten excellent advice, but I would like to hear a more general consensus (if possible) regarding my situation.

At the moment I'm trying to spend my free-time both at work and at home to learn programming and any relevant skills.

The biggest concern I have is how and when I can make the transition into working within the tech space, with software dev more specifically.

My current plan is to do whatever I can on the side, and look out for any potential opportunities whilst continuing with this 2 year program for ATLEAST the next year.

Some questions I have to the wider community more specifically:

Will the next year be enough to learn programming, upskill and complete projects to a level enough for entry-level roles in the space?
Would it be more important to go back to Uni and get a relevant comp sci degree (would be about 2 years given my free electives and such are eaten by my mech eng. courses) to help in my learning and garnering a formal qualification
I've considered doing an online masters degree in something like data science or cyber security (which I can complete whilst working) but I'm not sure how relevant these could be for programming as a whole + it would require some prior knowledge I'd assume
I do know that my current role will become more intense as I progress through the project lifecycle and become more involved with longer days/hours leaving less free-time for study which is why I'm considering a second degree.

Apart from that, any advice on potential next steps and how to move forward would really help solidifying my plan for the future.

If there's any more information I can provide please let me know.

Because of this, I can only find the energy to do about 2-3 hours of programming a day.

My plan was to continue working and programming for about 2-3 hours per day (which would give me a max of 711 more programming hours by the end of the year assuming the unlikely that I'll both never miss a day and always do 3 hours instead of 2).

The thing is, I have been working as a database engineer for almost 2 years but most of the work is not very challenging. It is very repetitive and you don't require much cs knowledge to do it. As a result, I did not manage to gain any actual experience as I was doing the same thing day in and day out.

In these 2 years, for almost 1 year I was free. I did not had any work to do and no calls to attend. So i started doing leetcode. Its been around 5 months of leetcode now and I think Iam OK at it now.

 I know how to solve problems and I want to shift companies. The problem now is, I don't have any Skill or actual work experience to share with my future employer. All I know is how to leetcode and some basic select queries and creating stored procedures in database.

I have been applying to many companies in this pandemic but none have reached out to me. I think the culprit is my lack lustre resume as I have nothing to to showcase as my actual work.

Its just 2 years of bogus experience.

So what do I do? I can't apply for a Backend engineer role since I haven't worked on it. I can apply for database roles but i only know the basics. 

Shall i start leetcoding sql queries?


Is there any role where I can utilise my leetcode skills and basic db skills to get a good job? 

What should be my next step in order for me to get selected in any other company with a decent hike? 

Iam at my wits end.

**TLDR:**
 Worked for 2 years. Most of the time, was free. Hence no actual work experience. Did leetcode practise in free time. Now i dont get any interview calls because I couldn't showcase my work in my resume and I have basic skills only.

What should be my next step in order for me to get selected in any other company with a decent hike?",1620504620,t3_n7xedb,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n7xedb/need_career_guidance_have_2_years_of_work/,221,995,3,1401600906,0,1,techindie

Being an ECE student i have light  programming experience on c and tried experimenting with a little bit python too. I am not seeing a clear path as to how should i approach learning stuff.

(my future classes of ECE include JAVA, object oriented programming using C++ and machine learning too) 

I am reading some books like Learn python the hard way, C programing by K.N.KING.

I have been learning data structure and algorithms as well.

532,n7tyks,SheldonPlankerton,Entry level jobs in NYC,"Hello,

Currently I‚Äôm still in high school, but in a couple of months I‚Äôll be in college majoring in CS. I currently live in Georgia, and I‚Äôm going to a pretty average college in the Atlanta area.

My family is telling me to stay here after college, but I‚Äôd really like to move back up to the NYC area. I‚Äôm not looking to explicitly work in the city (although that would be nice), I‚Äôd at least like to live in the nyc metro area. I wanted to know what steps I should take now to better my chances of getting a job up there.

I feel like I‚Äôm sounding pretty vague, but is it possible that in 4 years there‚Äôll still be entry jobs up there? From what I hear most people talk about there being less and less job opportunities up there than compared to atlanta or the west coast.

I honestly don‚Äôt care who I work for, as long as I make enough money to afford a living space, food, and having enough to put away in savings. I don‚Äôt expect to be making 100k right off the bat, but I don‚Äôt want to be making so little I can barely get by but I think that‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs way of thinking. 

So the main point of my post is:

Is it still possible to have job opportunities up in NYC? And what steps can I take now to give myself a better chance of getting a job up there? I‚Äôm gonna be a college freshman in a few months.

Thank you",1620494542,t3_n7tyks,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n7tyks/entry_level_jobs_in_nyc/,770,8815,1,1599509133,0,1,SheldonPlankerton
537,n7rnh1,mynameisanominus,Which jobs do you think I should go for? (Some experience),"Hi everyone,

Here is my current situation:  

* I work on a business intelligence team (title is business analyst) where I build solutions to minimize engineering overhead required for other business analysts to do their work. For example: Python wrappers around APIs/databases and machine learning tools.
* I am able to work in and understand a ""cloud environment"": K8s on AWS, Artifactory, Docker, Spark
* Good background in machine learning (math major, 2 medals in Kaggle competitions).
* I would say ""good"" understanding of computer science fundamentals: data structures & algorithms and using these correctly in Python.
* Some Java understanding (3 courses from college).

My goals are pretty basic and probably common:

* Land a job in Seattle.
* Work with many other engineers in order to build a strong professional network.
* Work as part of a larger system/software-base (basically have my work intertwined with other SD's work. Most of the stuff I build now is stand-alone).

So now I'm wondering what sort of positions I should be applying for. I think I would be a good fit as a SD on a ML-engineering team, but these positions are scarce and seem to want people with more experience. That said, I'm definitely not set on staying in data analytics -- I think it would be great to learn new technologies as I can see myself working on a research/start-up team in the future.
  
  
Anyways, what do you all think? What sort of positions should I be applying for? Can you recommend any services that will help me land a job?

Thank you!",1620487913,t3_n7rnh1,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n7rnh1/which_jobs_do_you_think_i_should_go_for_some/,6,45,2,1575029260,0,1,mynameisanominus

552,n7lld1,Dry-City8766,Psych undergrad with minor in CSc,"Hello, Im a psychology major about to enter my fourth-year next fall. I've recently (last 5-6 months) gained a significant interest in programming which began with a intro to data science course I took last fall. I am currently in school for a bachelors in Psych with a minor in Computer science.  I feel like that might not be enough especially since applying for software engineering internships has been rough to say the least. 

Should I consider applying for a masters in csc or data science? Im not too keen on working in the data science field due to many subreddits stating that many data science jobs today are not at all like the cool stuff you learn in school, also that many of these ""data science"" jobs are really more like data analytics and things of that sort. Machine Learning does seem very interesting but I am not sure if that field is dealing with the same things I have read online with data science. Can ML engineer be a similar work environment/field as a software engineer (assuming you work at similar tech companies). Idk much all I know is that I feel more challenged and more satisfied when I work on my csc projects. I'm also taking an aws cloud technical essentials course on coursera so maybe I could work with that to start my career and then transition into software engineering?

571,n7e1ad,SquidwardTennispoles,Using a Military Deployment to Switch to CS from Physical Therapy?,"Hi all,

So I am in a strange situation. I got accepted to go to PT school about a month ago and was supposed to start in the fall of this year. However, my national guard unit got surprised with a deployment that's going to be from Oct 2021 to around September of 2022. This means I won't be able to start PT school until Jan of 2023.  I will be honest and say it does have me down in the dumps since I applied specifically after being told this deployment wouldn't happen but now it is. 

Now since I will be spending a year in Kuwait doing basically nothing (and will have internet access most likely) I have been looking at what I can do to not make that year a waste of time. Looking at CS vs PT I noticed how much more upward mobility and flexibility there is in the CS career field compared to PT. Also not to mention not having to go to PT school for 3 years which means no income at all and maybe some debt even with the military paying for schooling. 

I have always liked computers and have built many systems, but I have zero experience with code. If I applied myself over the course of a year would I be able to become proficient enough in the an area of CS to possibly switch career fields and work my way up from an entry level position in the future? If so what path should I take to go from learning to applying what I learned to looking for a job? And of course is it even a good idea to think about changing careers when I have an acceptance letter in hand to PT?

Any input is appreciated. Thanks everyone",1620436705,t3_n7e1ad,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n7e1ad/using_a_military_deployment_to_switch_to_cs_from/,38,23,0,1492174126,1,1,SquidwardTennispoles
