        "body": "I'm going to preface this by saying that if you've seen me making the same repetitive, hair-on-fire post in other subreddits, I apologize but I've just been trying to figure out what to do about my situation.\n\nI took an intro coding class the first semester of my freshman year of college (am currently ending my sophomore year) and I hated it, mostly because the material was so foreign to me -- ended up withdrawing from the class. Despite changing my major to Econ, I took an equivalent course at a community college last summer. Didn't particularly enjoy it but I think that was more of a result of the pandemic than anything. Now, I'm taking the next course in the CS sequence and actually really enjoy it and am doing moderately well, probably right on the median grade. I also found out that I've actually got quite a few of the other classes required for CS out of the way and would still largely be on track for the major (maybe an extra semester or two, which sucks but isn't as big of a deal as if I were paying out-of-state tuition). \n\nThe problem is that before I realized that I actually do really like CS now (like it's my favorite class and I wish I could spend more time coding during the week), I applied and was accepted into a program for UX design at my school. I like the thought of being a UX designer, but I realized that the market is oversaturated and the program itself isn't very difficult i.e. I feel like it wouldn't give me the same marketable/technical skills as CS and it'd be harder to find a job. \n\nI find myself at fork in the road trying to choose between two things I feel like I'd enjoy but one of them would be tough to find a job (UX) or one that I'm still not totally sure I have the chops for (CS -- and also I might be screwed for finding internships being as old as I am). Has anyone been in the same position, and if so how did they navigate it? Also, has anyone made the jump into CS this late as well?",

I am familiar with computers and beginner/entry coding like HTML CSS and Javascript(freecodecamp). I have been looking into a career as a developer, (I know this is a broad category), right now I wouldn't mind doing front-end or back-end work to start. Eventually, after a few years working as something along the lines of that and getting familiar with the industry, I would want to have a shift in career and focus in Mobile Development. Tech Elevator-Pittsburgh is in my area, and I have been really looking into their 14-week program and of course, the marketing point of time & cost of Bootcamp vs 4-year degreee (I cannot afford the time or cost of a 4-year degree). I do not have a degree, but I have completed a 4 year accredited apprenticeship in my current trade(not that this is relevant in the tech field but maybe work experience?). So I have a few questions as far as:\n\n1. Is it worth it for someone with no degree or tech-related background to go through a Bootcamp with expectations of starting a career upon recent(6months) of graduation?\n2. Is this the best route / how would someone in this current field recommend going about this career move?\n3. Has anyone been through, or heard any about Tech Elevator? Reviews? Experience? Employment? \n4. Looking for general advice/any recommendations on the topic of the Career Field itself, and Tech Elevator / other Bootcamps in general.\n\n**Thank you for reading!**",

I had uploaded pay stubs and tax documents that verify my employment there (and of course, have shared contacts who could verify my employment), but in the section where the background check details \"Employer Response\", all these fields are blank. I have good references and experiences at all of these companies that others can vouch for, so I'm not really worried about that. (I'm a US citizen so this isn't about visa or work authorization - just happened to work in China for a few years before coming back to the US)\n\nIt seems like it was flagged because they couldn't get a response for those companies (they're international well-known companies with offices in China that I worked at). I reached out to my recruiter to let her know about the situation, and that I'd be able to provide any supporting documentation or contacts HR would need to help verify my employment. My recruiter responded and said \"that makes sense, and I've cce'd HR here, but I wouldn't worry too much about it :)\". I responded to the email and communicated to HR to reach out to me if they need anything, and I haven't received any response.\n\nI'm probably being overly paranoid here, but how likely would it be that my offer ends up being rescinded, without any warning, because of this automated background check?

I was given about 2k more than my asking range, which at the time was amazing news to me as I didn't know I was worth that.\n\nI am also an integral member of the team and am the only one currently employed by them that does what I do.\n\nI've recently received news of the possibility of a temporary salary cut within the next couple months. Allegedly this would be temporary and they would make up for it with future increases, bonuses and upcoming stock options. One of my colleagues has even already volunteered for his salary to be cut. Of course I don't know his finances, but the feeling is now if I don't do so as well I am a greedy jerk who doesn't care about potentially laying off colleagues.\n\nThis would be a 13-16% decrease, which would put me in the same salary range as the company I worked previously, which I left for this one. I drew a line in the sand and basically told them I wouldn't go any lower than 10% cut, as it was my minimum asking salary when I applied to the job.\n\nI was also somewhat hinted at the fact that a colleague developer may be let go if funding doesn't come through as expected, but that they want to keep me. This also does not sit well with me.\n\nI told them I'd have to think about it, and talk to my SO, who was absolutely livid at the whole ordeal and wants me to quit ASAP (after securing another job, of course). \n\nAnyway, even typing this out,  and re-reading it before posting, nothing sits well, but I suppose I am holding on to the fantasy of the possibility that we'll hit it big and I'll be rich if I just hang on for this next little while.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that I started not too long ago (6 months, give or take) and did end up joining them over other companies due to their generous offer, but now feel like that is being held over my head. Can't help but think that I may have made a big mistake and only now it is coming back to haunt me. \n\nSo what are your thoughts on this situation? Is it normal? Is it reasonable to take that cut under particular circumstances?\n\n**tl;dr: being told of the possibility of being asked 13-16% salary cut within the next couple months.

        "body": "Hi there,\n\n###\u2003\n\nI'd like to apologize in advance for the long post. Feel free to skip the life story and jump right to the Questions section if you'd prefer.\n\n**tldr: I'm looking for advice on pursuing a career in programming without a CS degree.**\n\n###\u2003\n\n###Background\n\nI've loved to program since I was about 12 or 13. Learned Java to make Minecraft mods, went to some tech summer camps, took a couple high school programming classes - a pretty common story. From early on, I never even considered pursuing any path other than CS, and went off to college with that plan in mind.\n\nNow I'm 22, still a student, and just realizing that I couldn't care less about computer architecture or the IEEE 754 standard for floating point arithmetic. I've never been good at math, which has proved to be a roadblock for things like time complexity, etc. I aced every Data Structures programming assignment, but tanked all the written tests. I definitely had a different image of what \"Computer Science\" was, and am now coming to terms with it not being for me.\n\nI'm still as passionate as ever about programming, and I'm also pretty damn good at it. I work on personal projects in my spare time, learn new languages, and have built up a sizeable portfolio of code.\n\n###\u2003\n\n###Questions\n\nI still definitely want to pursue a career that involves programming, and there's two paths that come to mind:\n\n* Shift gears to a major like WebDev or Game Design so that I obtain an actual degree.\n\n* Use my previous internship experience and code portfolio to try to find work without a degree.\n\n###\u2003\n\nRegarding making that decision, there's a couple things I'd like to ask about/get advice on:\n\n1. How beneficial would a non-CS, but programming related degree be for finding work? I'm fully aware of how important a degree is in the application process, but is it worth it if it's not a CS degree? What would my time be better spent on - looking for work, or getting one of those degrees? How about a programming certificate?\n\n2. Are there any other programming related degree options that I'm not thinking of? WebDev and Game Design were just the first things that I thought of.\n\n3. My understanding is that a CS degree allows for a wide variety of career paths. If I do end up getting a degree in one of those more specialized majors, will I pretty much be restricted to just that field?\n\n4. If I do end up deciding not to get a degree, are there good tips for improving my odds at being noticed when applying for jobs? I'm sure there's already a bunch of posts on this subreddit asking about this, but I figured I'd ask anyway. For example, I've been using various AWS services for years and have gotten pretty familiar with them. Should I look into getting AWS certification? Anything along that same vein?\n\n###\u2003\n\nMy mind is sort of scrambled right now trying to figure out my future. I'm sure my post isn't as coherent as it could be, but I appreciate anyone who took the time to read it.\n\n###\u2003\n\nThanks,\n\n/u/AnImpromptuFantaisie",

However, in the event of this not going to plan, I want to ensure that I have a solid backup that I can jump back into, pays well and I won't have to start at the bottom of the ladder again.\n\nSo therefore my question is, which career path would be best for me, PHP or .NET? Is there more of a future in .NET and would I earn more money in that career path or is PHP still a solid option? Does it matter if I plan to go freelance anyway?",

Do you think that's possible? I understand I would be working all day, but the reason why I can justify this is because I normally don't do anything over the summer anyways and I know as soon as I finish my day at company A I would practically just play video games for the rest of the day and get bored.\n\nHow do I approach telling both companies the situation I'm in? Should I ask them if they're okay with me interning at two places at once or should I keep that info hush hush?\n\nI would like to work at both companies for the experience and because I would like to build a relationship with both companies in order to expand my full-time options upon graduation.\n\n**Team:** The technologies I'd be working with overlap a lot. With Company A I'd be working with Python, Docker, Kubernetes, and some cloud stuff. With Company B I'd be working with Java, Docker, Kubernetes, and some other stuff. Both companies placed me in a real team working on real products.\n\nBoth jobs are remote and company B mentioned that they're flexible with the time I start and end the day as long as I get the job done.\n\n**Compensation:** Company A is more per hour, but Company B is more long term since it is a year long internship rather than just summer. I don't necessarily want to factor compensation into my decision but I'm including it to give a better picture.\n\n**Competition/NameBrand:** Company A uses Company B's software so I don't believe they're necessarily competitors \u2014 and I believe Company B is better known because it has been mentioned before in these CS subreddits whereas Company A has no mentions.\n\ntldr: I want to intern at two companies over the summer. How do I go about doing this?",

From my understanding, when asking a previous boss/associate if they would be willing to provide a reference, you typically share your resume with them. But here's the thing:\n\n* I only had two work experiences prior to my current job as a software engineer\n* The last experience was a \"software developer\" internship in the summer of my senior year, where I did very little actual coding and mostly menial crap\n* The experience I had before that was a research position where I did work that a trained monkey could do\n\nGiven the fact I got nothing from my summer experiences, let's just say I \"embellished\" my resume a bit regarding those two positions and have already submitted my resume to companies that I'm in the final stages with. Should I email my potential references without providing my resume? Or do I revise my resume to be slightly more accurate and hand them the revised copy?",

It naturally skews towards people who are drawn to high compensation / level / \"prestige\"\n\nEven sources like [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) only show the compensations of people who choose to share it, which again isn't a representative sample. If compensation / level / prestige is what you're after, by all means, go for it and work for it. But comparing yourself to people who  *humble brag* on social media does nothing good for your mental health. [Studies](https://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/) have shown that Instagram is bad for teens' mental health, comparing yourself to the humble braggers on LinkedIn/ Blind / other CS / DS focused social media would likely have a similar impact on your mental health too.\n\nAlso keep in mind that on average \\~65,000 CS graduates graduate every year in the US. If you include China, India, and Russia the number is more like 460,000 graduates per year, of which \\~45,000 are considered elite. My source is this [research article](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/14/6732). Assuming a 15% annual growth rate , that means \\~3.5 million CS graduates just in the last 10 years,  (5.5 million in the last 20 years).\n\nOf these, only about 10% (just napkin math based on number of employees in Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and assuming only \\~50% of them are \"tech\" roles) can ever work in Big N, and of the 10% there, only about another 10% make it to Staff levels, which is where you see compensations of 500k+ (some seniors can make it too, but it's more reliably available at staff+ levels). And these salaries too are only common in SF Bay Area, Seattle, NYC, and maybe Austin. \n\nSo you're comparing against 1% of an industry that is already on average better paid than most other industries. So take a deep breath, stop comparing yourself against humble braggers, and know that for the most part you will be ok.",

My first question is an average LeetCode Medium, yet most candidates fail to solve it.\n\nAs a candidate myself, I find you can very often get an offer by solving nothing more than some LeetCode Easy questions and maybe an easier Medium. These are all six-figure positions in above-average startups and small-mid sized companies in the Bay.\n\nSo while someone reading this forum can get an impression that tons of candidates are \"grinding LeetCode full-time\", and because of that companies are starting to ask harder LeetCode Medium and even Hard questions, my experience indicates that:\n\n1. Even above-average companies are mostly asking LeetCode Easy and a few easier LeetCode Medium questions.\n2. Most candidates fail to solve these questions, which suggests they're not \"grinding full-time\" or anywhere near the levels suggested by posts here.\n\nWhat's your experience?  How much did you \"grind LeetCode\"?  How many hours per day, for how many days?  How many problems solved per day, and overall?  What difficulty were they?

Meanwhile recently as of this week I got my second offer at a defense company starting at 76,000 and I was wondering whether to go with the tech company or defense company? The advantages of the tech company that I could come up with are that I would learn more about databases and frameworks and C# as well as some security principles, At the defense company I have not gathered enough information other than developing in C++ and learning about the systems they use currently. Which should I choose? This will be my first job in the industry so I want to make a solid choice.",

        "title": "Extending degree for two more internships or not",
        "body": "Hi there!\n\nI know this is a long post and I understand if you do not have the time to read it. But if you do, I really really appreciate it and I would love it if you could offer your input on my dilemma.\n\nI am currently finishing year 3 out of 4 of my software engineering degree and I am also enrolled in the school\u2019s co-op program. Because covid hit us hard last year, I didn\u2019t manage to get an internship last summer (as I was supposed to per my co-op recommended course sequence) and so I had to take some summer courses and shuffle around some classes.\n\nThe co-op program wants us to do three internships before we graduate. I have done one already and I will be doing another one this summer. This leaves me with only one internship left to do but with two semesters worth of courses left. This leaves me with a dilemma in my hands.\n\nOne option is that because I only have two more semesters of school left, I could simply study next Fall and Winter and thus graduate next Summer (beginning of May 2022) with two internships (and not three). I would have to quit the co-op program for this (not a big deal).\n\nThe other option is currently what I am planning on doing but I have my doubts on whether this is the best option (hence my posting here). I could take another internship this Fall (internship #3), then study in Winter, then take another internship in the next Summer (internship #4), and then finally go back to school for Fall 2022 and graduate in middle of December 2022.\n\nMy dilemma here is the following: is it worth it to extend my graduation date by nearly 8 months in order to graduate with four internships instead of two? I will write down a list of advantages that pertain to my situation for each option below and I would love to have your opinion on which option you think is better (and if my points make sense or not).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption #1 pros:\n\n\\- I will start to earn a better salary (vs lower intern pay) sooner and so those eight months will be a lot more profitable.\n\n\\- Will also make me acquire \u201cbetter quality experience\u201d sooner (i.e. full-time experience is seen as superior compared to intern experience). Instead of having 8 months of extra intern experience, I will have 8 months of full-time experience.\n\n\\- Not dragging on school longer than I need to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption #2 pros:\n\n\\- Doing two extra internships (at hopefully two different companies) will allow me to experience more work environments which will allow me to know what I like more, what company is better, where I should set my standards, etc. I won\u2019t be able to explore companies as much once I get on the market since leaving before 1-2 years is seen as bad on your CV.\n\n\\- Will allow me to have a more developed professional network. I don\u2019t plan on returning to my first company but maybe to my second one. And so, with two extra internships, I would have the possible choice of returning to three companies vs just one.\n\n\\- Would allow me to apply to FAANG for my last internship (Summer 2022). This would give me a better chance to compete since I would have 2 internships + 1 ongoing when applying in August 2021 as opposed to having to apply to a newgrad position with 2 internships where it will be harder to get into a FAANG (with option #1). Am I correctly estimating the difference in difficulty of entry for intern vs newgrad or do you think that I would still be ok with applying for a newgrad FAANG or Microsoft position with just 2 internships?\n\n\\- Would allow me to possibly travel in January-March 2023 after graduation with my girlfriend since she would have the time off from university during those months (although this is not set in stone). If I find work right after graduation in December 2022, I would try to negotiate my start date for it to be in March 2023 or something. However, in the case of option #1, I doubt that I would be able to get some time off after 8 months of work in order to travel (and this is assuming that I start working in the beginning of May 2022 immediately).\n\n\\- Would have an easier time getting a newgrad position in general with 4 vs 2 internships. However, I am wondering if it really makes a difference at that point anymore. Would I really have an easier time? And would I really be able to leverage a much larger starting salary and benefits with 4 vs 2 internships? Maybe a hiring manager can chime in on this point.\n\n\\- Jumping into the market later could be a good thing since it would allow the job market to recover even more after covid. However, will the situation really improve that much between May 2022 and December 2022 for this 8 months extension to be worth it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, the way I see it, option #2 offers a lot more flexibly and potentially better outcomes (e.g. travelling after graduation and easier FAANG entry). However, I am afraid that stretching my studies this way is simply a waste of time and I should just jump into the market as soon as possible with option #1 and get paid better and gain better experience since I already have 2 internships which is enough. What do you all think?\n\nThank you so so much to everyone who managed to read everything until the end of this wall of text. It really means a lot to me and any input will be highly appreciated!",

I came from a small company and I'm now making a move to my next job and I need a bit of insight on what I should be looking out for now that I am moving to a different job.\n\nApart from the common things to consider such as WLB, I want to be working on tech that will keep me relevant for the next n years while being able to gain mastery in my craft. I'm debating the two things at the moment:\n\n- Do I continue the path to specialize in Python or on cloud tech?\n- Do I want to expand my breadth of knowledge in technologies?\n\nI have two companies that I'll likely join. One is a huge bank so software is not really the focus (con), they use Java which I thought is old and will not be too relevant if I learn but I did a quick job search and a lot of companies actually still use it. If I take this, one of my goals is to add another language to my toolbelt, another is to prove to myself that language is just a tool and I can join a team that uses a tech I do not know well and get comfortable with it. I also want to learn a little more about bigger teams coming from a small team myself. I also think I might learn a thing or two about the Java ecosystem. Do you all think this is a good idea?\n\nThe second one is a medium sized company but with the team size similar to what I'm used to. They use similar technologies to what I know - Python and cloud. I am by no means an expert on either so I know that I can still learn something here. They do have a product that I find interesting. If I take this, my goals will likely be to deepen my mastery of the technologies that I know, try to level up and be a senior someday.\n\nI have been reading about this and there's common mention of T shaped.

My course consists of a lot of programming and CS: high performance computing, algorithms and numerical methods, parallel programming, object oriented programming etc. \n\nAs an international student, employment is pretty hard for me and was wondering whether I would be able to get software engineering internships and positions with an aerospace engineering degree or should I look to pursue a masters in CS after my degree. Also I'm more interested in the algorithm development and ML side of CS, would I still be able to get a position without a CS degree?\n\nTIA!",

        "body": "Good Morning,\n\nWanted to pass along a warning that there has been a recent spike in spear phishing targeting job seekers on LinkedIn and perhaps other sites like Indeed. The fake job offers, many of which are aimed at technical people and developers, attempt to get the targets to give up personally identifiable information (PII) or install access trojans like More_Eggs in the form of an \"offer package.\" The motivation appears to be access-for-hire\u2013where access to compromised systems is sold to others for use in subsequent campaigns.\n\nThe scammers are posing as companies using combinations of gmail accounts and in some cases look-alike domains (examplecareers.com instead of example.com.) They're further using real names of company employees obtained from public websites and LinkedIn profiles.\n\nMessages include weird wording (note the \"no right answers\" instead of \"no wrong answers:\")\n\n> Please find attached the Screening test/Interview Questions for the Screening/Interview process. Keep in mind that there are no \u2018right answers'.\n\nThey also try to create urgency with time limits so targets don't think and click:\n\n> You are required to email back your answers to me within the next 90 minutes.\n\nanother example:\n\n> You will be receiving your Employment Offer Letter from HR via e-mail to sign tomorrow. Our aim is for you to start training as soon as possible. You are to immediately forward the following information to enable the HR secretary register you and prepare your offer letter\n\nBecause these attacks are targeting out-of-work professionals with personalized and compelling campaigns, user education has to come through non-work channels such as professional organizations, or reaching out to friends whom you know to be job hunting. That's also why I'm posting here. \n\nWe have seen a number of different companies impersonated over the last week and not just major names like Microsoft or Amazon but small and medium sized tech companies as well. The attackers are choosing companies geographically close to their targets for name recognition and legitimacy.\n\nWatch out for red flags if you're job seeking:\n\n- Unusual grammar and wording choice in professional emails.\n- Statements that create very short term urgency.\n- Changing addresses/domains between subsequent contact.\n- Use of free webmail services by the \"HR\" people or use of domains different from their primary site domain.\n\nWhen it doubt call the company using a known good number found on their website to confirm you're interacting with real people. Do not trust phone numbers in email signatures.\n\nMore Information:\n\n- https://threatpost.com/linkedin-spear-phishing-job-hunters/165240/\n- https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/hackers-targeting-professionals-with.html\n- https://www.esentire.com/security-advisories/hackers-spearphish-professionals-on-linkedin-with-fake-job-offers-infecting-them-with-malware-warns-esentire\n\nMods, I hope this is OK...

        "body": "I've been working for a few weeks in a new role that's remote. The company used to be in office but transitioned into a remote company after the pandemic. The company is about 500 people in total and apparently I'm one of the first on my team to be on boarded remotely.\n\nWell things haven't gone so well. For example:\n\n- there's no real onboarding to speak of. I was doing work just a few hours after I started my first day. No meetings with HR to discuss items, no overview of company culture and values, no new hire orientation.\n- No one speaks to one another on Slack. I'm in a lot of rooms and I might get a message pop up a few times a day, and this is with hundreds of people. \n- I barely know about the company. How are we doing financially? Who are our competitors? Who is the head of engineering?\n- I don't know my coworkers. Seems that everything is \"strictly business\" and no one talks about their hobbies/likes/interests. No humor or ice breakers. Basically they are just names on a screen. There are 3 people on my team that I have never even spoken to or were introduced to. \n\nI should point out I have been working remote for years now, long before the pandemic. I have onboarded and mentored people remotely. So I know this can and does work. But this experience here makes me feel disconnected and like I've already been lost in the shuffle.\n\nI'm really worried that the moment I'm stuck on something I'm going to go at it alone, and that's just not how I can work. I know I can't change a culture as a new hire, but I want to at least try to survive it for now. Do you have any suggestions?",

        "body": "Hey, I want to double major in Finance and Computer science at UIS. I am not worried about understanding or grasping new concepts but if anything I am lazy and would look for an easy way out. So far joining the CAP honors program and double majoring doesn't look hard or too strenuous to achieve.\n\nI am worried about the content and the quality of the education that will be given to me. I want to know if the lessons and instructions from the professors will suffice in offering the materials I need to thrive whilst also putting forth the effort to elaborate and explain any concept. Becoming a Quant trader is hard work and seems like mostly ivy league kids get those jobs. I ask this because I am fairly confident I can learn anything thoroughly from a teacher who puts in the effort to talk and explain during class and not just demand homework or to read a textbook (which is practically self-teaching and again I am pretty lazy and require someone to teach me rather than demand me to teach myself).\n\nWill these two majors be beneficial to become a quant trader? If not what would you suggest?\n\nDo you think getting degrees from UIS would be satisfactory for future employers or would I have to stand out even more than others ( I am set on attending UIS although I have been accepted to more rigorous schools)?\n\nIf I would have to teach myself and basically create my own lesson plans what would you suggest I do? Please offer a routine that I could follow and be specific on how/what to do.\n\nI am not 100% devoted to being a quant trader, I am actually really into real estate and owning properties and making only enough to live somewhat comfortably, but my goal is to aim high and see where it takes me. I am currently a senior in a somewhat prestigious public high school (Lindblom MSA Chicago) with 3.56UW & 4.49W everything so far has been easy and that's also thanks to my teachers actually caring to teach.\n\nAny and all advice would be beneficial!",

I have been going through another process with a dream employer which suggested they would pay \u00a330k. They haven't replied after my final interview for 1-2 weeks now, and it's just getting me a little bit nervous.

If you are a web developer or a mobile developer, you usually would just use the library or frameworks to do these optimization for you.\nOr you would even prefer a simple solution rather than applying several algorithms to maintain a O(log n) complexity. Like, even we have 10k records to be returned from the server, we would have pagination to increase the efficiency, it is unnecessary to apply mergesort, binary search, quick search to get a record sometimes. We can just call an api to get that record.\n\nI asked this because I get an interview question, which was literally a easy lc question for a web developer position.

Sometimes I go on Indeed to see a job that fits what I am looking for and do a  quick apply. I applied to a Junior Software Developer job at a company called  Attratusit located in San Fransico. To my surprise, someone wrote back and wanted me to give them some times that worked best so we could talk on the phone, and I could ask any questions. Excited I gave them some times and started to try and research the company to impress them with my knowledge. Well, there is virtually nothing about them and the info that is available seems incredibly vague. I even googled the address and tried to see if I could zoom in and see a building with the name on it and nothing... here is the website [https://attratusit.com/contact-us](https://attratusit.com/contact-us) \n\n I guess if I do set up a call with them what should I ask or should I avoid this altogether. I need some advice on this. \n\nThank you in advance.",

In your opinion, do you think someone with a business degree and experience/projects/bootcamp cert in computer science has a chance at pursuing a career in software development?\n\nI wasn't going to make this post, but I thought it would help someone else too so why not... \n\nI am currently 23M with about a year left in my business administration degree. I never really knew what I wanted to do in high school (as many don't) and decided to study business administration because it was sold to me as a good degree for people who don't know exactly what they want, but still has weight in the workforce. HAHA come to find out, while my business degree has allowed me get a very generalized education in business, I feel as though I have no real skills that would differentiate myself from other applicants for jobs in the workforce. Looking back, I feel misled by my counselors in high school and college that told me it would be a \"great\" degree. Not saying it isn't great, but there are more specialized degrees I would have been much better off getting in finance or accounting. \n\n I have a year left in school and I don't feel like I can point to any one skill I developed over the course of my time in college that would apply to a job in the business world. I have done well in school, averaging A's and B's and my GPA sits right around 3.3 at the moment. I have recently started learning about programming and discovered that I actually really enjoy it. I decided to take an online introductory course in programming and I am currently working through that. I only have a year left in college and won't be able to change majors now. Is it possible to get a job and pursue a career in CS with a business admin degree and (1y+) experience in CS such as a bootcamp cert supplemented with a lot of projects? \n\nI am good student and a self-starter. I truly believe that if I dedicate myself to learning a coding language, I could become a very a good programmer. However what concerns me is even if I dedicate my time and efforts into becoming a good programmer, I would be dismissed as a potential candidate for swe jobs because I don't have the right formal education. \n\nI would appreciate any thoughts, comments, experiences etc. shared here.",

        "body": "Got laid off from my first W2 software engineering role at an industrial internet of things company late December. It was an awesome company, I learned a lot, had a ton of one-on-one time with the CEO (He even wrote me a letter of recommendation after the lay off, which is on my linkedIn). \n\nIn the 11 months I worked at the company I had the opportunity to bring several features from design to completion in our flagship software product using mostly Javascript, PHP, and mySQL (we sold hardware that allowed other business to use our software to monitor, track, and control through standard protocols of modbus, CANbus, SDI-12, etc. - I even wrote a few drivers for these sensors as customers requested them). I even collaborated with their business side to build a new version of their corporate website as a quick side project when business began to slow down due to covid.\n\nAfter being laid off I became pretty depressed and decided to spend some time with family. During that time (Jan - Feb) I applied lazily to a few jobs on Zip Recruiter, but definitely wasn't giving it my all - didn't get any responses.\n\nSince then (March - now) I've applied to maybe around 40 - 50 companies with a revised resume and haven't got any responses. I have been reached out to by one company that I didn't apply to (they were looking for an SEO/marketing expert, not a software developer) and a handful of the usual sketchy LinkedIn recruiters. \n\nTo me it seemed obvious that the market would be softer during this time compared to Jan of 2020 pre-covid when I was last applying. However, I have no degree of any kind and back then my only experience was running a little freelance web dev company for small business to supplement my table waiting income, still at least I was getting tons of responses and often would make it to final rounds then get dropped due to lack of experience. I figured even with the softer market my newly acquired full-time experience would yield responses at the least, but so far nothing. No calls, no emails, just thumbs up on Zip Recruiter and \"application viewed\" emails.\n\nDo personal portfolios make a difference after you have experience? I took my outdated one down about a month before I was laid off because I figured I wouldn't need it for a couple years lol. I haven't been pushing to Github in a while, but recently spun up a create-react-app to re-familiarize myself with React - which is obviously super popular and a cool framework IMO.\n\nAny tips or revelations in this post covid market? Should I rebuild a portfolio from scratch? Should I start posting JS tutorials on medium? Should I make a dang JS tutorial Youtube channel? \n\nLast time I applied with practically zero experience, I applied to over 1100 companies in all 50 states, had something like 35 - 50 first rounds (hr calls), 20 or so second/third rounds (dev, technicals, or CEO talks) and made it to somewhere around 7 final rounds (technical, engineering team, or CEO talks) before finally getting hired. Whats crazy is those numbers are all conservative estimates, I definitely went hard last time - just having trouble imagining going through anything like that ever again. It was an incredibly draining process mentally and I actually took a multiple month break after the first 1000 resumes out. All of that is a huge story of its own that I might make a post about some day. \n\nSorry for the rambling, cheers!",

        "body": "Story time: I got an offer from a company for a sales position. I want to work in software, but all my experience is from my own startups and SaaS projects, along with some freelancing, and am finding interviews hard to come by without a degree (I've had 1 dev interview so far, it went great, still waiting to hear back). In the meantime I found a sales position, interviewed with the stipulation that if a tech jobs picks me up, I have to accept their offer and leave the sales job. Sales job has high turnover and is cool with this, it's even an addendum in my contract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSales job's company does have an internal software team. Being a fullstack web dev, any website I spend time on I check out the console and play with the inspector, because I find it interesting. I sign my contract with the sales job, they get me in their all their web apps and CRM, and I decide to check the console for the web app, which is developed and maintained in-house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI open the chrome inspector and see a log full of my personal information, and pretty much the response from every single request this web app is making. I think it's weird a $220 million / year company would make such an amateur mistake of letting console.log get to production in so many sensitive places, and decide to check the network tab and try to make a POST request myself from Postman, since my auth token is sitting right there in localStorage. Postman requests are accepted, which is also amateurish to leave CORS so open. Maybe this is on purpose?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter maybe 20 mins of playing with the endpoints being called by the app's login process, I find major security flaws. I found that user UIDs are incremental and not random (Parler made a similar mistake), certain endpoints pull all information including photos of passports, driver's licenses, SSNs, DOB, pretty much anything you can think of related to their sales team members. S3 buckets left open with minimal security, on top of all their backend lacking proper RBAC.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheir system has tons of basic and some more advanced design flaws, and just plain errors (they set a default password for all users during onboarding, but the password never works they say. I go in there and they're storing the default password in plaintext, but then checking it against a hashed version of that default password. No wonder it never works lmao, but at least they're hashing passwords).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside from not wanting to enter ANY of my personal information into this system, I see this as an opportunity. I found that they do have several open positions for software engineers, but their requirements are either 5 years more experience than I have, or DevOps and site reliability engineers, of which I am neither.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can I approach my sales boss and ask him to connect me to their software team, in an effort to ask for a job fixing AT LEAST the issues I've found in 20 mins with no real effort? I'd rather work in software than sales, but I want to go about this the right way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see 3 options as of now: I tell my boss their system needs work and wanna help fix it:\n\n1. He doesn't understand software and fires me before I even start, because finding vulnerabilities makes me untrustworthy.\n2. He understands I was not malicious in these efforts, sends me contact info for their dev team's hiring manager, I have a shot at the job.\n3. He asks me for a full write up on the issues I found, passes it along to a dev, the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy current plan: tell my boss over the phone/zoom about the issues, explain the severity, and ask for a shot to talk about it with the dev team. This doesn't give him the ammo of a full write up, while still acting in the company's best interests. If they do want a write up, I again in email explain the threats and severity of them, along with a link to the job opening that I want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd love option #2, and obviously avoid option #1. Help me out here, how do I leverage this knowledge to get hired by the dev team?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: they do not have a bug bounty program btw.",

I'm not sure if I'll survive once it actually gets difficult so I am highly considering switching CIS (information systems) because it requires less programming and less math.

I believe that opportunity will be substantial enough to propel my career forward and my undergrad school will be irrelevant in a few years.\n\nMy dad has a BS EECS from MIT and a CS MS & PhD from UIUC, and he is pressuring me to transfer schools and/or attend grad school. He has told me that in industry, your school is irrelevant in your first 5-ish years, but after that, the majority of people in senior-level positions have graduate degrees or attend better undergrad schools. He's also emphasizes attending a better school to get to know famous professors and do research with them, which is not something I'm particularly interested in.\n\nPreviously I had intended on transferring, but after I got my internship I've become unmotivated because I don't see it as a necessity anymore. The issues I have with transferring are that I might lose credits and have to retake classes, which I'm unsure is worth the tradeoff of a better name.\n\nThe schools I have applied to as a transfer are UIUC (rejected), UCI, UCSD, UCLA, and UCB. Can anyone give me some insight on how transferring to one of these schools, or going to grad school will affect my future career prospects? Ideally I would graduate with a job in FAANG or a Unicorn, and I'm unsure how hiring or promotions would be affected if I graduate from my current school and don't attend grad school.",

As someone with absolutely no \"real world\" experience in terms of working a job related to computers, I feel that it has become absolutely critical for me to start applying to internships.\n\nHowever I have become a little overwhelmed and confused about how robust my gitHub portfolio must be.  \n\nMy understanding is that a gitHub portfolio where you can showcase your programming skills is essential when applying for work in the field of computer science. \n\nMy confusion is regarding how many and what types of programs should I place into my gitHub and how many different languages do I need to code in?  \n\nThe programs I have written in various classes are kind of all over the place, some are pretty mediocre, like coding a simple calculator to learn how to code GUIs.  Or very basic programs to learn simple data structures.  \n\nOthers are a little more complex like code that I wrote in my algorithms class, however in the algorithms class each coding assignment required us to add to the previous assignment so that by the end of the course we essentially only had one giant program with a lot of different functionality.  I worry that might make my gitHub portfolio look a little sparse.  \n\nEven worse, I have pretty much only coded in Java so it would be very difficult for me to code programs in C or C++.  In fact, I haven't even learned Python yet because I started my degree program before Python become popular when the preferred language was Java.\n\nI worry that coding a robust detailed portfolio for gitHub could take weeks (maybe even months?) especially if I need to include code in more languages than just Java.  I worry that this will take so much time and effort that it will greatly delay my ability to actually start applying to internships.  \n\nIf anyone could give me a few suggestions as to how detailed a gitHub should be for students looking to find their first internship, I would greatly appreciate it.

What can I do?\n\nA little background about me. \n\nI'm at a top 20 university and I switched to cs last semester as a junior. I have way less course work/experience than my peers and honestly I feel quite inferior and even more so when theres hundreds of rejection emails. I started applying with little experience/side projects/idea of what I'm doing in october 2020. Fast forwards till now, I got something between 5-10 hackerranks. Some of them I aced and some of them I didn't do as well. But none has lead to an interview or anything beyond that. \n\nApart from just applying, I also emailed and DMed people on LinkedIn, had phone calls with them and asked for referrals when possible. I believe I've applied to 150+ positions so far. I really think I did everything I can so far but the results are far from satisfactory. I'm also an international student, so I don't even qualify for a lot of positions. \n\nIk i'm kinda late for summer internships now. I'd appreciate any suggestions on how I can increase my chances for fall recruiting or just what I can do from this point onwards. Thanks for reading this far. I'll let my stress diffuse :)",

        "body": "Hello everyone, hope everyone's doing good.\nThis is my first post on this sub-reddit and i would really like to seek some guidance on career transition .So, i am a recent BS mech graduate (june 2020) who got a job at a newly formed corporate organization which deals with City gas distribution. The parent company has many subsidiaries in other sectors too (power supply, pharmaceuticals and fiber optic cables) .Being gullible, i thought work would be great and that there would be choices to work on different problems related to various fields ( i was keen to work on projects related to machine learning and improve my programming skills).\n\nHowever, the expectations are a far cry from ground reality. The work is monotonous. I have to sit here for 10 hours a day and maintain excel records or might have to design the same components on AUTOCAD ( a drafting tool) over a million times. The worst part is the overtime for which you are not even compensated. This corporate's outlook is parochial. I have no free time except for a few Sundays when i don't have to work overtime. I was expecting to learn new skills but the job satisfaction  is nada, nilch. I have always hated mech and regretted for not choosing CS (my real interest). I am really pondering about quitting my job  this month  for the sake of sanity and also to learn new skills.\n\nI desperately want to pursue my interests and find a new career in the field of my liking where i could learn new things regularly. I have had  interest for machine learning ever since i took an elective course about neural networks and basic python programming in college. I have alot of questions in mind about career transition to ML:\n\n1.what core skills should a ML engineer know?\n2.Do MOOC certificates(edx, coursera, udacity, etc) help in interview? \n3.Do interviewers form biased views while screening due to a lack of CS degree?\n4.do you know anyone who has made a similar switch and if you have done so, can you share your experiences ?\n5. I have been thinking about pursuing a masters in either robotics or AI. Would that be helpful? Or should i consider a MS in CS (ML specialization)?\n\nThank you for taking your time to go through my post. I know it's long and Sounds more like a rant, but it would be of great help to know more from personal experiences.",

        "body": "Some background:\n\nAbout to turn 26, started college late and graduated with a bachelor's in cs last summer. Mental health issues have always been a struggle of mine, making normal things like getting decent grades and networking unnecessarily difficult (graduated with a 2.9, 0 internships, no connections, etc.).\n\nCurrently, my resume consists of 3 unrelated jobs, 4 projects (1 in web/crud app in progress a web scraper, and 2 school projects). I have a terrible response rate and have applied to well over 500 places with a less than 1% callback rate.\n\nGetting my resume grilled countless times, it seems like I just lack ambition. I'm not looking for moral support, but I think it's important to convey that I feel like I'm endlessly throwing shots in the dark with this job hunt and want to know what I should really be doing.\n\nWith that being said, I want to be a software engineer. I don't care if it's web, mobile, whatever, as long as it's relevant, relatively modern, and growing. I haven't touched leetcode in forever because it felt like a waste of time considering my abysmal response rate. Currently, this is my plan of interest:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Finish my web app, deploy it\n2. Contribute to an open source project that I like (vscode being one since I actually use it and it's written in a familiar language)\n3. Create a mobile app like tinder/psychologytoday except for finding therapists and other mental health professionals\n4. Hope that people use my apps and that I get to tackle real world problems\n\nTwo issues with this. One, being that creating apps on my own takes way longer than expected, and hoping that I get decent traffic is just another waiting game. I wish I did extracurriculars in school or led some organizations/teams related to software to have something to showcase besides than just technical jargon thrown on my resume. I think ultimately, landing in big N would be my goal.\n\nNone of my projects have impact. They show that I was able to improve something a little here and there, and my irrelevant jobs really don't mean jack. I'm thinking of enrolling in an online masters, but i'd really prefer to be getting some real world experience in this field. What am I doing wrong?",

I just feel like its a bit of a waste of time to try to get all the non technical people involved when me and the frond end guy can figure it out much faster.\n\nThe problem is I don't think the CEO likes that very much. Hes always messaging me to respond in group but front end and I already discussed and are working to resolve. Im not saying I completely ignore the group but if there is a quick fix and it would take more time to explain to the whole team than to just do it with frontend, I'll just not respond in the group chat.\n\nIm very early in my career though so I could be wrong, I appreciate any feedback.",

It was an uphill battle for me because I didn't really have a structure in my studying. I started with courses in Coursera, Udemy, and etc. Completed courses in Web Development, iOS Programming, Databases, but I knew that I would have to get a proper education, so I started taking college courses in CS once I graduated from my Bachelor's program and started my first full-time job. Around that time, I started solving LeetCode, Euler, CodeSignal, and etc. I liked solving algorithmic problems. I knew that I would have to get good at solving LeetCode style questions, so I started practicing them, but it wasn't a chore for me. Mind you, I hadn't taken any course on DS and Algos. Everything I learned about that was from YouTube videos and LeetCode.\n\nAbout a year later, I started applying for jobs. My general CS knowledge and my LeetCode practice helped me land my first full time job as a WebDev. I learned a lot, and the problem solving skills I developed in Engineering helped me out tremendously. I kept doing interviews, just to get more practice. I applied to one of the big tech companies and got absolutely destroyed. It was a wake-up call for me. I changed up my preparation and finally started learning DS and Algos in the proper way.\n\nThen I got into grad school in CS at a pretty good school. I have landed my summer internship at a unicorn as an ML Engineer, and I may land an internship at FAANG for Fall 2021. My LeetCode grind paid off. However, so far I have solved 300+ JUST LeetCode questions. I am not even counting CodeSignal and HackerRank. Albeit, I mostly practiced on LeetCode.

The hours are very awkward when we can be on at the same time at a reasonable hour. There's only a 3 hour overlap, and the coworker has meetings pretty much scheduled for the full 3 hours. So if I have a question, I would not get an answer until the next day due to all the meetings in my coworker's busy schedule. If I have something to follow it up, usually it will not be answered until the following day.\n\nThat is my frustration. I am not trying to point blame or anything since family emergencies happen all the time. I am actually deeply appreciative that my coworker even decided to work at all during this time. However, the fact that I am just thrown into a massive code base with little documentation, and the fact that my coworker has very little time to explain things mean I am not proceeding at an appropriate pace. I often find myself stuck on a problem that I am trying to solve for a whole day only to find out the next day I am not on the right track and the fix is something my coworker can just tell me in a few minutes.\n\nI believe this is a very inefficient use of my time, and my coworker is probably frustrated about the fact of mentoring me with such a timezone barrier. \n\nHow should I word this so my manager does not get offended. I do not want this to leave me with a bad performance review for not being able to deliver within a reasonable amount of time.",

        "body": "Hi guys - pretty much the title. I am a recent grad (May 2020) and in the 7-8 months I've been working full time have made me feel incompetent, and not without reason. I have a lot of trouble doing simple things and I really shouldn't. Looking back I'm not sure how I even got through university. I never really liked coding that much, but as an international student that was the safest option for me if I wanted a career and potentially a life in the US. I have not been given a notice or anything, but I know my superiors aren't happy with my performance. I am not sure how long I can keep going with this. I am pretty sure this has been hurting my mental health for the last few years as well.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any ideas. I do have a deferred offer to an MS program, but I don't think I will do well in it so not sure if there is any point in going for it - why pay loads of money to not do well and still be bad at my job? I also have the option to continue applying to other jobs to see if it fits, but the truth is I don't think the problem is my current job, but the fact that I'm terrible at this. Which is why I'm asking if there is a way out.\n\nSorry for the rant.",

My thesis project was basically a remote software developer internship, but not technically.  I thought an undergrad in computer science, plus a relatively practical thesis, plus a former career (ie, I have soft skills) would've been enough to get plenty of responses from companies.  It hasn't come close.    \n\n\nSome opportunities evaporated because of COVID. I got far for a data analyst role out-of-state, but I never heard back after I submitted a form that asked for salary expectations ($70-$80k was the range I inputted. learned a lesson there, and that's to ask what the budget is for the position during the first interview.)  I was recently approached about another data analyst role in NY (again, out-of-state) that was paying 52k - yeah, no thanks.  The Indian bodyshops contacted me several times already, but I ignored those messages based on what I read on this subreddit.  Recruiters asked for my resume for several software developer roles after saying I'd be a good fit, but I never hear back.  A few others tried to entice me with business analyst positions with little to no technical skill-set required.  Why would I go back to school to get a technical degree to work in a non-technical position?  \n\n\nI've applied to about 140-150 companies either directly or indirectly (sending resume to recruiter who reached out on LinkedIn).  I tailor my resume and cover letter for most of those applications, which ranged from software engineer to technical business analyst.  I reached out to a few contacts, including friends of my parents and siblings.  Several of these contacts (including a technical recruiter) helped a lot in refining my resume.  But I don't think it'll be enough.  \n\n\nI completed several toy apps before I went back to university for a CS degree.  Since graduating, all I have to show for it is a login and registration portal with Java, Spring Boot and SQL.  The plan was to build something I find interesting, but I lost interest.  Perhaps it's because of the tech stack.  Perhaps the lack of positive feedback from the job hunt is weighing me down.  My lack of job hunting success is probably part resume (now fixed) but probably also lack of a sophisticated portfolio to show hiring managers.  Some on this subreddit might respond with, \"Build a web app with Node and React!\".  I enjoyed most of the CS classes, debugging, programming, etc, but I'm filled with a sense of apathy after all these months.  I'm not sure where to go from here.",

        "body": "I've kind of been on a rollercoaster of majors/career prospects since I started school. I was really mentally ill in my first 2 years of school. I was a CS major, but I can't remember a single thing. Really depressed and anxious meant missing a lot of classes, which then meant copy and pasting projects. I screwed myself over and wound up trying to pick up the slack over a summer by coding some games. I have been a \"gamer\" since I was super young, but I'm a casual gamer. I play often and am pretty good, but I still consider myself casual. I transferred to a game design program, which was honestly stupid of me. I still could've done games with a CS degree, but not the other way around. As I'm entering my final semester of school, I'm realizing a lot of people in the industry are a lot more passionate than me. Sure, it's fun making games. At the end of the day, I wanted to be a programmer and programming games is fun.\n\nFor a while, I thought the bad WLB, average pay, and terrible job security would be worth it to have a \"fun\" job. Then, I realized I could make slightly more money in games by being a producer. It was what I started to focus on. Near me, there is 1 \"good\" studio and a handful of indie studios. However, there are TONS of places for SWE, including Google.\n\nFor my real question, I was curious how tough it is to make this jump. Obviously, right out of college I'll have to go into games- it's what my degree is in, and my entire portfolio is only games. I figure I would try to get a producer job for 1-3 years, and then transfer into software project management. If that seems totally not feasible, then I would also be open to coding games for a few years before trying to transfer into SWE. I learned Python on my own time, but haven't used it in so long that I'm not sure I could do much with it. I use C# regularly and have gotten pretty good with it. I figure I can spend the next couple years expanding my knowledge beyond just games production, learn .NET, and then start looking for C#/.NET programming jobs. Thoughts on this? Which would be better in terms of pay, security, and WLB? Progression? Again, there are not a lot of paid game industry opportunities near me, and only one good studio. But lots of Tech companies, both Big N and start ups.",

I'm still waiting on a decision from Qualtrics (experience management tech company) that will come later this week, and I need to decide by this week, so I'd like some help deciding. My main priority is to put something good on my resume so I can get CS jobs easily in the future.\n\nNASA is a well-known brand name, but I'm bothered by things like not being able to discuss parts of work and sometimes slow progress on their projects. Also, their interview process didn't really touch on the neural network/AI algorithm skills that would be involved in the actual work. I don't feel strongly about neural networks or AI algorithms and I'm not very skilled at using them, but I do think that using satellite data to model the climate is very grand-scale and could look impressive.\n\nQualtrics is less known, but it's a tech company; I think I'd probably learn more useful CS industry skills here. When in person they offer benefits like food catering and paying for moving/housing, but this year it's going to be remote so it might be underwhelming. I think they will be using more relevant technologies too. And furthermore, they will pay more than NASA, though money is not my top priority. I've read mixed reviews on their work-life balance, so I'd appreciate any insight on that. I was thinking perhaps a tech company name would look better for future CS job applications. Finally, they actually gave me coding tests in my interviews, so I feel more confident that my programming skills are well-suited for the job.\n\nTLDR: need help deciding between NASA and Qualtrics remote internships, NASA is more publicly known and climate modeling might be more interesting while Qualtrics pays more, aligns more with my coding skills, and is a tech company",

Everything is better than I could have hoped for, from the work that I'll be doing, to the compensation, but there is one small thing that worries me. The position that I am accepting is technically non-entry level. I have about 12 months of internship experience, but I'll be working in an area that I don't have a ton of experience in (ML), and the team that hired me is aware of this, but I'm feeling a bit of pressure. Furthermore, the team that hired told me throughout the interview process that they want someone to bring some solid SE practices to the team, as much of the team doesn't have a form CS education and come from the math side of academia. I went through a pretty rigorous program, but I'm feeling a bit worried because my background is definitely more in the math and theoretical CS side of things. I'm starting in a month and was hoping for some resources where I could work on those skills before the job starts. \n\nCheers.",

        "title": "[Toronto] How do you know your worth?",
        "body": "I've always had issue with low self-worth due to various reasons growing up; that said, I don't have any developer friend connections to whom I can ask these questions, so I'm looking for general advice/guidance for my future prospect.\n\nI've always had passion for technology. Having no social life at an early age, video games became my escape mechanism; I was more intrigued on the process of video game development than the actual game itself. It got me into the world of software development and boy oh boy, did I get pulled in it. I enjoyed tinkering, modifying existing piece of code to see changes on a website, hosting private game servers, etc. I slowly started to teach myself programming, I got okay at it. I used to help out other students in high school during CS class (nicknamed SilentCoder as teachers pet because I didn't talk much thanks to SA); I got paid for doing their homework...which was neat as I grew up in a poor immigrant family, it allowed me to buy things I wanted for the first time in my life. Since then, I have been doing freelancing on the side during high school and continued onto post secondary. It paid me enough to cover my living expense while I attended university for Software Engineering. I worked throughout the school year, sometimes missing classes to attend work on the side; Weekend was extremely busy as I tried to catch up on work and school.\n\nI secured a contract in 2015 for a third party client via a prof at school I built 3 big projects from scratch (Firebase, AngularJS, Cordova, React Native, GCP, AWS, OpenCV, Embedded System, etc). It was 2 man job but the other person never contributed any work and still got paid for it; I was too scared to stand up for myself so I never said anything about it and kept on working on the deliverables. I used to sleep for 2-3 hours a night to work on the project while making sure I had my schoolwork completed; I wasn't aiming for high GPA, just enough to pass by and get a degree. Can this ~3 years of experience be considered towards my YoE since it was before I graduated as an engineer?\n\nAfter graduation, I had 5 month period of gap where I was job hunting and getting rejected; due to low self-esteem I was about to give up. Secured my first professional gig with a startup (team of 10) in October 2018 (3 month contract making $70k CAD, no bonus or raise) as an Intermediate Developer. The contract got extended for entirety of 2019 and became full time in 2020 (same pay); I've been with this company for 30 months now. I started off creating a small internationalization module for a legacy mobile app (Ionic 2/Angular 4) but due to the nature of app being a MVP, it had to be redesigned quickly due to growing number of issues and no support for iOS. I ended up re-creating the entire platform in Capacitor in 2ish months, which opened doors to iPhone users. This helped accelerate the growth of platform and MRR. With more services being added and ever-growing pain of WebView, it was time to go full native. I've spent the past few months working on both Android/iOS platform in native kotlin/swift language. All of this while working on 1 internal/2 external web tool(s), maintaining production environment, handing outages, dealing with issues on the field, bug fixing, features development, meetings, etc. There are only 3 members in the tech team so far. We all are on rotating on-call shift, I cover evenings, nights, day and the rest cover morning/day throughout the year. First 1.5 year was hell when it came to on-calls, woken up in the middle of night multiple times to fix ongoing issues; we've managed to tone the occurrence down to once in a while call now but regardless of what happens or who is on-call, I always get call from the operations since I am most likely to respond to a situation within seconds and time matters with these use-cases. I don't mind handling the issues as I am home 99.9% of the time, plus I can't leave with the anxiety of something breaking down while I'm outside and not having access for a immediate resolution. I've put in 12-16, sometimes 18 hours everyday (switching between code bases), while also taking small freelance contracts on the side and also contributing to open source. Never taken a single day off, even if I was sick (remote working); I can't even think of taking day off without feeling stressed, anxious or guilty about it. I am the youngest in the company, rest are 40+ with 20+ years of experience in the tech field yet I've always been considered equal to them, them asking questions or seeking help from me with technology I know and I doing the same with their knowledge; I get the same respect as any other in the company, which feels weird to me having never experienced it before. At the start of pandemic, 2 people were laid off and we had to take 10% paycut (with stock options at a low strike price), not sure when it's supposed to go back to normal, we are in middle of finalizing capital in Q2. I've been feeling demotivated and unable to pay attention lately, I'm few weeks behind schedule but CEO is fine with it since he knows I've been dealing with other tech issues. I have my 1-1 with CEO bi-weekly, what kind of questions/topics should I be discussing?\n\nI'm the first in my family to ever get an education and get a job paying this high (I know it isn't a lot and I'm very grateful but considering my parents combined income is less then my first makes me feel so guilty). I already had the pressure helping my parents acquire their first house with my name on it due to my salary, so the anxiety of keeping the bills paid is very strong. The case of imposter syndrome has been real since day 1, I know I'm not the greatest rockstar engineer, still have a long road ahead but I feel like I don't deserve this position. On the other hand, seeing the post with people making 6 figure while working few hours makes me question my skills and abilities of being good enough to ever get on that level. I try to stay up-to date on most tools, services, best practices, most of my weekend goes into studying. I know I want to earn more but my people skills are terrible especially when it comes to interviewing. I find it hard to talk about myself and sell myself as a good engineer. I have to add more public projects to my portfolio, I have been working on a home automation system using RPi, a drone with camera for ML/AI, kubernetes along with a rover, are these decent side projects? I've started to go through the fundamentals of DS and Algos in order to prep myself for interview in the future, haven't tried leetcode yet...uber scared based on what I've read on here but for some reason, I can't get myself to sit on for hours learning again, can't seem to focus. I used to help out people with programming problems on discord, I even don't feel like going on it anymore. Is this due to burnout? \n\nI don't know much about salary negotiation, my worth and how much I should be asking, when should I be asking for a raise if I even should? Does title matter in a startup? How does the title system work? I'm already 27 and I feel like I should know all this information by now. I've read few mentions on mentoring, how does one go about finding a mentor. What should one look for in a mentor? One of my colleague was a CTO for a company acquired for $1.1 billion in his previous career, would he be a good candidate? How would I go about approaching this topic? I know I need to provide value to a mentor, what kind of value should I be looking to provide? I've always considered myself full stack developer since I'm usually working on all the layers but since my title is intermediate developer, should I be using that on my resume? How do I know if I am smart/worthy enough for FAANG? Is P.Eng. worth looking into and does it help in this field? How does one go about networking? I am not good with people in social settings so what exactly does networking entail? \n\nTrying to decide whether to stay with current company or look for new one later this year. Thank you for reading my long post. Any help would be appreciated.",

        "body": "I originally decided to pursue a degree in computer science solely for the expected job security and stable paycheck. I grew up around working class people, and saw how so many struggled to support themselves. I was always terrified of ending up out of work and unable to pay the bills. \n\nI\u2019ve always been proficient at IT-related work and worked part time as an IT support rep for my university (a job I loved despite only making $13/hour), but I knew that software developers make much more money and were in high demand. I ended up doing well in my classes, despite not really enjoying writing code. But, I figured that I could just treat it as a means to an end and enjoy life after work. That seemed to be the way life goes, and I thought I could handle it. \n\nI was hired 3 years ago as a software developer to rewrite a legacy application at a non-tech company. The deal was that we had to complete one project for the legacy application and then we\u2019d design a rewrite. We completed that project in about 6-8 months, and then started designs for the rewrite. The company ended up dragging it for another year due to several organizational changes and I was stuck doing maintenance on the legacy application and supporting production. I started looking for new roles and even had an offer until my manager finally moved me to a new team where I\u2019d actually be working on new code. I decided to go with that instead of the other offer because I wasn\u2019t very enthused about the company and the industry it was in. \n\nOn the new team, I was doing well enough despite not being highly motivated while working from home due to covid. I still didn\u2019t enjoy coding at all and struggled *a lot* any time I was assigned a major feature to implement, but I was getting by without anyone accusing me of incompetence. I even got a very good performance review. After less than a year, I got moved back to my old team because I was literally the only person left with any knowledge of how the application works. I tried telling my manager that I wasn\u2019t interested and didn\u2019t feel confident, but he said he needed someone with experience. \n\nIt\u2019s been about a month and I\u2019m absolutely miserable. I wake up nauseated every single morning and even vomit once or twice a week before logging in to my computer. I\u2019m the only developer on my team and I\u2019m really not able to handle it on my own. The technology is extremely old - the app was written when I was only 13 or 14 years old - and I struggle to understand many of the components. I\u2019m terrified of what will happen if something goes wrong and I can\u2019t fix it because there\u2019s literally no one supporting me. My manager said they\u2019re trying to find more developers, and he expects me to be the team lead once he does. But I really cannot do it any more. \n\nI started looking for a new job again and it looks like i might have two offers on the table. One for another development role, and one as a security tester. I can\u2019t decide which role to take. I\u2019m worried that I could end up being good at development if I have a good team and get enough practice, but it could end up being just as stressful as my current job. Taking the security job, on the other hand, would be a fairly major career change. It\u2019s still in technology obviously but I would be giving up potential experience in development that could have a long term effect on my career. Lastly, I often wonder if I\u2019d be better off taking a lower stress job even if it doesn\u2019t make as much money, because I know I can\u2019t handle the stress I\u2019m under for much longer. I feel like I\u2019m going to have a mental breakdown nearly every morning.",

        "body": "I'm about 8 months into my first full-time gig.  Never landed an internship, didn't go to an elite school, so it was very difficult landing this first job, but I did have some projects, a very strong GPA, and network connection to secure the interview.  Then I interviewed really well and accepted their offer.  Comp is pretty meh for a very HCOL area.\n\nIt's at a large fortune 500 company as a backend software engineer; however, I quickly learned that the engineering department is rather small.  Myself and three senior engineers among a larger team of business people.\n\nAt first, I really enjoyed it and was just psyched to be working full time as a dev.  And I learned that I DO very much enjoy the work, and this career is definitely for me.  But the cracks at my company have started to show over these past few weeks.  These past two weeks in-particular have been unbearable.  \n\nI was on-boarded and currently work 100% remote due to the pandemic.  It's been really, really hard to establish relationships and grow due to this fact.  My manager is more of a tech lead and has never had any direct reports before me.  He's a nice guy and helpful if I push him, but he really doesn't seem at all interested in helping me grow.  Everything on zoom is transactional as fuck, and it feels extra depressing working in silence for the majority of my day broken up by 15-minute meetings where two people go back and forth really fast on something I have little context until they finish and everyone immediately drops.\n\nAs a junior, I don't get a lot of control on my projects (understandably), but it always feels like pulling teeth to try and get context on any project I'm assigned.  I mainly get assigned micro-tasks (fix this bug here, that bug there)/grunt work (understandable to some degree), but my manager is totally disinterested in reviewing my own goals or helping me understand the general goals of the business.\n\nFurthermore, although the everyone is really nice, the culture can be super frustrating sometimes.  Everyone is so concerned with their own individual shit that they often lose sight of what we're trying to achieve as a group.  And when I first joined, I thought leadership was awesome since they were all really nice and welcoming in the beginning, and they say all the rights things.  But from the way our team works, I'm really starting to question the quality of the leadership.  We are never allocated any time for documentation (oh, right, I have to figure out our entire codebase and tech stack with very minimal documentation.  Then senior engineers get annoyed when I pester them with questions), I always feel rushed to start coding without planning ahead, my questions about potential next steps/where-does-this-project-end-up are always shut down, and worst of all we prioritize shipping absolute dogshit code (not even \"bad\" code.. I mean like... 5k lines of dense logic nested in for-loops and if-else statements written linearly) that we know will break in the future because it's more important to meet the deadline as not to upset leadership.\n\nI'm getting overwhelmed with frustration and not sure what to do.  I am frustrated that we can't be in office, frustrated that nobody really provides me guidance, frustrated that we essentially sabotage our projects for the sake of optics.\n\nI'm naturally a very ambitious person and really want to do well both individually but also as part of a team.  I feel like due to the pandemic I'm playing the game with my hands tied behind my back.  Recently, I've been doing just the bare minimum to keep people off my back like some of my team members seem to do, but I really fucking hate this.  It's just not who I am and not the kind of professional attitude I want to adopt.\n\nI know there will be no perfect company, and at least some of these issues will be present in otherwise great companies, but I feel like it has to be better, right?  I feel like I'm too young and early in my career to become so bitter and jaded about soul-sucking cOrPoraTe AmErICa.  \n\nMy intuition and everyone I talked to has told me to stick it out for 12-18 months, then bounce.  But after these last two weeks, another 4 months seems like for-fucking ever.  I really don't know if I'm going to make it.  Would it be looked down upon to dip after 9 months?  Should I just try to do the bare minimum to avoid getting fired then leave after 12-18 months?  Should I try to talk to my manager to improve things even though he seems not super receptive to managerial duties?\n\nRANT ABOUT THESE LAST TWO WEEKS:\nThese last two weeks have been increasingly frustrating and stressful.  We had won a government contract, and as part of that contract, we apparently promised a turn-around time of 1 day on this project.  Which no one told me about.  So I am given this sample dataset and told to write a python script to do X task in preparation for this project.  Cool, I can handle that, and I do.  Then the day of this project, I get called into a meeting and apparently my script isn't working.  I take a look, and it turns out the sample data provided to me to create the script is not at ALL like the data in full dataset.  So I try my best to explain this to these senior executives, and of course all they understand is \"script no work, code monkey fucked up.\"  So I spent the next few hours sharing my screen and being watched by all these execs while I debug my script for this major project with hundreds of millions in impact.  For the first time, my hands were literally shaking as I typed because I felt so much pressure.",

At the time I was hired, he had designed our front end, back end, and database architecture.  Most of the time I was given smaller tasks to work on, or projects that had minimal impact to the company.  Basically I was in a position to learn how we worked and what to do.  \n\nIn December he was let go right after the company hired a new IT director.  The new director is well versed in hardware, networks, and security.  He works very closely with our help desk associate.   At this point I am entrusted to make all decisions concerning our codebase.  \n\nRecently we had reviews which I took very seriously.  I laid out all projects I had been a part of, all code I had deployed, included metrics on the benefit of each of my accomplishments for the company.  Based on previous conversations I felt like this was my time to step up and benefit a company that was entrusting me to make good development decisions.  \n\nI received the standard 2% raise and no discussion concerning personal growth.  All the goals that were listed required more discipline and ownership but my title would stay the same.  Basically I stayed in the same position, adjusted for inflation, with no career path and no mentorship or code review.  \n\nI really like working here but I feel extremely slighted.

I have a 2.5 GPA currently.   \nI have ADHD and wasn't medicated for my first year of college and my GPA dropped dramatically because of the Pandemic, I failed a few classes (my GPA was at 1.7). Once I got medicated I retook a bunch of my classes and even did well in the next semester, this is what brought it to a 2.5. \n\nNow, this is where I'm having trouble. I tried to retake a few other classes I got Ds in, but UConn has a policy that lower-level classes can't be retaken once the higher-level class has already been completed. (In my case I can't retake Calc1 because I already took Calc2). Thus my GPA can only rise from taking new classes and not any old ones. Which is wonky.   \n\n\nQuestions:\n\nHas anyone gone through something similar in their pursuit of a CS degree or job?\n\nShould I move schools? \n\nIs this a common thing amongst schools in general?\n\nIn your opinion, how will this affect my future as a person seeking a CS degree?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!

My motivation simply being twofold:\n\n* Firstly, like most people, I would like to have money\n* Secondly, cost of living in my city has risen sharply over the past year - most notably house prices. I am looking to buy a house and because my salary hasn't risen I am actually in a worse position to buy a house now than I was when I started the job.\n\nI am hoping people here could give me advise on whether I should go ahead with approaching my manager to suggest a pay rise/review and aso how I can go about phrasing it.\n\nEach year, my company does a pay review of all professional employees and assesses any payrises and bonuses. Last year, on my one-year anniversary, there was a modest bonus and cost-of-living salary increase; my payrise specifically was <1%. I questioned whether I got a below-inflation pay rise because of under performance and was assured that my performance was fine and it was unrelated. This year it has been announced that no employee will be given a payrise (however there has been suggestion that it can be petitioned for individual employees to be reviewed).\n\nIf I worked for a company that had been laying off or furloughing staff, I would not attempt this as it would be obvious that the company was struggling financially. But I know that even though the yearly targets of the company were not hit because of COVID, they still make very attractive profits and have continued to aggressively hire staff because of huge increases in demand.\n\nOf course, I would not simply frame my request as \"I've worked here for 2 years, gimme money\". I think there are multiple arguments that show that I am worth extra money, such as:\n\n*  Agreeing to be an on-call engineer for call-outs 24/7. I work 1 week on, 1 week off currently.\n  * I have also voluntarily stayed up out of hours on system rollout days to monitor progress and to be able to react if something goes wrong.\n  * I get paid modest standby payments for this, but in my opinion this simply covers my additional time spent monitoring and the general inconvenience. It is in no way a premium in compensation for me taking on greater responsibility in my role.\n* I lead development and support tasks for a couple of lesser-known systems that I developed on a now disbanded team. And frequently onboard colleagues with those systems if they ever ask about or need to develop them in any way.\n* When I was hired, they considered paying \u00a340,000 for a person with `x` skills good value. 2 years on I have `x+y` skills through time invested at work and out of work so logically I am now worth more.\n* I have submitted and achieved the recorded goals set between me and my line manager consistently since starting. Surely the point of goals is to develop an employee professionally. If these goals are being hit, then logically they are a more valuable employee and merit greater pay. If not, I see no value in these goals beyond being a box-checking exercise.\n\nGiven what I have said, does anybody have any advice on whether I should pursue this? I fear that unless I regularly push to make employers see my value, my compensation will stagnate. But, I do not want to make a fruitless effort and tarnish the relationship with my employer/manager in the process.\n\nIf you do think I should pursue it, what would be a reasonable figure?",

I don't know what I want to do as far as a career let alone what all my options are. I know broad categories (web dev, desktop app, embedded pc, game dev, etc) but not much more. Even within web dev, the options are actually insane.\n\nI don't particularly like web dev. By web dev I mean the experience and self education I have done in HTML/CSS/Js and .net. HTML/CSS are awful and I hate working with them.\n\nI have gotten the most enjoyment out of my data structures class where I wrote all the data containers by hand in c++.  The coding between my data structures class and for web dev feel very, very different but I can't quiet articulate how they feel different and why I prefer one over the other.\n\nI guess I prefer working at a lower level? Applications seem to be up my alley more but from I am reading, desktop applications are becoming more and more scarce. Is mobile dev the new desktop app?\n\nI am not against web dev. I am however completely against informative/blog type websites. These are boring. I'd much prefer to build a website that serves a purpose and deals with data.\n\nI am too inexperienced to know what I would like based off these two experiences.

        "body": "# Context\n\nMy last job was working for a small travel company. I was the only developer, and had full control of what I worked on and how I did things. I loved the people I worked with. I had no reason to leave other than maybe trying to gain some more experience in newer technologies from other developers. Unfortunately, COVID changed my plans to stay there.\n\nI initially looked for contract work, so I'd be available to jump back into things when the travel company got going again. Between feeling like I was limiting my search too much and worried that things might be bad for longer than I thought, I accepted a full time position with a software company back in October. I had still had the plan to go back to the old company, but I figured it'd be at least a year out before they got back in gear.\n\nThis new company has been great, and I feel like I've learned a lot since I've been here. I like my coworkers, even though I haven't met any of them face-to-face yet. The work is fairly interesting, and it feels good to be contributing to a team. The only downside is that there seems to be a lot of top-down pressure to meet quick deadlines. It hasn't directly affected me yet, but I see some of the other developers putting in a lot of extra hours to meet deadlines. I'm older than all of them and have a family, so I'm not interested in \"grinding\" to get ahead.\n\n# Now\n\nI'm coming up on having been at the new company for 6 months, but the president of the travel company is wanting me back as soon as possible now. He's promising things are stable and money's coming in. I told him I wanted wait at least a couple more months to see how things sort out, but I'm available to do anything little here and there. He's been paying me for 10 hours a week for the past couple months, even though he's only given me like 4 or 5 hours worth of work.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more excited I am about getting back. The pay would be equivalent. Both would/could be 100% WFH. I'd have to confirm about benefits at the old job, but I'm pretty sure they'd be able to match what I currently have one way or another.\n\nMy concern now is leaving after only 6-8 months. I not concerned about it looking bad on my resume, because I think I can explain the situation in a positive sense, and I have plenty of long term positions. But it just feels wrong to leave a job so soon, especially when it's to what most people would consider a risky industry.",

        "body": "My boyfriend graduated from college in 2018 with a CS degree. Since then, he has been unable to land a CS job. He's not even making it to the interview stage most of the time. I'm not really too sure what other advice to give him. He has applied to all jobs in practically every area of the CS spectrum. From engineering to general IT position, to UI/UX jobs. At this point, it's really starting to feel like a lost cause.\n\nWe talked about him going back to school since he really doesn't even like CS to begin with. He would much rather be in nursing, event planning, or maybe even accounting. Unfortunately, like many people, kinda realized this too late. And going back to school is really expensive, We also discussed maybe doing a coding bootcamp might be helpful.\n\nIMO, I think it's because he really doesn't have much technical experience on his resume. He never did an internship and his other part-time jobs aren't really \"CS\".\n\nAny ideas what to suggest?\n\nHere's a pic of his resume with personal details blurred out:\n\n https://imgur.com/N1t77TH",

Sometimes the recruiter will give a timed challenge and I don't solve it in time (nerves). \n\nThe last interview I had, I was very open. I spoke\u00a0about my previous experience at the previous company and how much I learned. I asked questions about the technology the company is using. Unfortunately, I wasn't called back for a second interview.\u00a0\n\nDid I waste my time with my degree? I admit I am not the best coder on the planet, but previous engineers have said that I am not as bad as I think I am. My personal projects are not up to paar because of all the work I do (I have been driving Lyft. I don't want to go on unemployment). I worked very hard to better my life and I am wondering\u00a0 have I been traveling down the wrong road the entire time? \u00a0\n\nIt is now going on 10 months since I have been laid off from my job. Something that *really*\u00a0scares me is the unemployment gap that I have to explain. Is this normal for a new java developer? Can someone give me some insight about what I am doing wrong?\u00a0",

I never felt like I had any technical challenges that I wasn\u2019t able to solve and find the actual software development part, the easiest part of my job. \nWhat I do struggle with is the communication and translation aspect of my job. Given there aren\u2019t any tech leads on my team, I find myself having to translate vague business requests into tangible tasks for myself to solve. I\u2019m given a lot of requests from the product owner with minimal context of the end goal, with a vague (sometimes inaccurate) explanation of what needs to be built. I feel like I\u2019m walking through a maze trying to get to the actual feature or task that the owner has in mind.\n Secondly I feel like I actively fail to translate a technical process into a digestible solution for other non-technical team members to understand. I feel like this is partially because they have a better understanding of the business goals and data than me, and I\u2019m just given data to work with, without understanding the context of what it\u2019s being used for, or where it fits in the larger business end goal. Im given features or tasks at face value, while not fully understanding why the request needs to be met in the first place.  \nThirdly, I feel like I lack the foresight to identify any potential technical rabbit holes that an idea or request might lead us to. I think something is straightforward, until it isn\u2019t. Then I face the consequence of having to notify the team that something may take a bit longer than expected. \nLastly, I just hate having to present, or even represent a project that I don\u2019t fully understand. Rarely do I give demos on my project, or provide an explanation on what we\u2019re trying to accomplish, but when I do, it\u2019s scary. I provide a generic description of what I do know, however given that the software is tailored to a specific industry that I\u2019m still learning, I fear misrepresenting the vision that the product. \nEven though I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019m a completely terrible software Developer, I feel like the unfamiliar situation that I\u2019m put in, is making me feel completely inadequate. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m just incompetent or I\u2019m not given the information and resources to do my job as well as I should. Once I understand what they want, the development becomes a breeze. But getting to there has always been a challenge.",

While pursuing this job, my projects got diverted towards data engineering and then I received a major project to design and develop a database from scratch - I did all the admin work, database designing, data cleaning, networking, backup, designing data pipeline, created REST APIs with Flask. The main goal was to establish a database, ingest data in it and end up with data visualization.\n\nI unfortunately got laid off and then started to interview for Software Developer jobs in the US.

I failed back to back in code assessment and became miserable without a job.I am thoroughly confused where I fit the best. I was neither a hardcore software developer nor I was a DB admin.

        "title": "Ask your recruiters if the on-site position they're pitching can be done remotely. They'll often say yes.",
        "body": "Before I recently resolved to find a remote job, I was in process with a few on-site ones. So I was past some or most of the technical screens, and in few cases with actual offers in hand. Then I informed the potential employers that unfortunately, I've decided to target remote positions exclusively.\n\nPractically all of them agreed to switch the position to full-time remote instead.\n\nI've had something like that happen before. In my last search, when I declined offers, a couple of employers asked of their own accord whether I'll reconsider if the position was switched to remote.\n\nThis time, however, instead of a small minority, it seems to be practically all of them.\n\nSince then, every time I get cold-called about a dev position, I simply ask: \"can this job be done remotely?\". Note that this is for jobs that are clearly on-site: the JD lists an office location and there's no mention of \"remote\" anywhere.\n\nYet the majority of recruiters respond to this question with \"yes\".\n\nMy conclusion is that the majority of companies are now open to consider you as a remote candidate if you actively push for it. If you simply say \"I only work remote now, but I'll be happy to resume this conversation if the job can be done remotely\" - most of them will say yes.\n\nThis willingness grows only more common the more they know you as a strong candidate.\n\nI had a chat with one recruiter about this, asking him: \"Your JD had no mention of a remote option, and in fact was clearly on-site. Yet when I asked if you'd consider remote candidates, you immediately agreed. Why?\"\n\nThe recruiter replied that the position had been open for a long time, they really need to fill it, yet the flow of candidates seems to only dwindle over the past several months. So he is fairly sure the employer will be open to consider a remote qualified candidate, even though that was not their original intention. He was right.\n\nA few caveats:\n\n- I'm a senior engineer with over 10 years of experience. The candidate shortage mentioned by the above recruiter seems to apply mostly to senior positions and experienced candidates. If your bargaining position is weaker, and/or they have enough on-site candidates, they'll probably be less open to consider remote.\n- Some big companies have an established policy on this issue. They are either OK with remote or they're not, and that policy is made and enforced at the global corporate level. I would not expect them to make an exception, even for a strong senior candidate. However, with smaller companies, startups, and even some big companies that make these decisions at the team level, there's often a lot of leeway, provided of course they are interested in you as a candidate.",

I tried a bit of another CRUD creation job in a different company but it was the same thing, just a different language (Python vs. Java). I tried mentoring online back when Udacity still had the 1-on-1 mentorships - which honestly I liked the most as the pay was great because of the currency difference but ever since that position disappeared, I failed to find any other similar to that one with such a good money and such low stress and workload levels. I tried developing games on my own trying to make ends meet from that but to say it's been challenging would be an understatement and I mostly go by through my mentoring job savings.\n\nSo now it's time to try out yet another career path - but I'm clueless about the direction. I wouldn't want to go to another mind numbing CRUD-coding job unless I absolutely have to (which point I'm thankfully not yet at) and the game dev jobs reality where I live (Poland) is that the pay is mostly laughable at junior positions when compared to \"regular\" programming with dubiously constructed contracts, no benefits and crunch being a normal thing so it wouldn't be my first choice either tbh. \n\nI know that with my selective professional experience (1y of Java, negligibly short burst of Python, mentoring which probably won't count for onsite dev jobs, game dev likewise) I'll probably have to start from a junior position yet again, and most of the \"sexy\" options like R&D are off the table. I've heard very good things about iOS for example because of the closed system (vs. Android) and less fierce competitions than fighting with 1000 bootcamp programmers for a junior position in corporate Java for example but that's about the only thing I've been able to think of.

I\u2019m also confused as to what my day to day basis would look like, and if anybody with internship experiences can help out, please do so, I\u2019d love to hear it :) \n\nWell other than that, I think that for the summer, I guess I\u2019ll be grinding those websites, making simple projects, and just trying to enjoy it as much as I can :).",

Since, then I have been working as an ML Engineer at a startup. Given my interest in research I decided to apply for PhD admission for Fall 2021 with the prospect of getting an admit from one of the top-30 school for CS PhD. My chances of getting into one are very slim at this point as I am still awaiting results from few of these schools. I currently have an admit from the school (ranked 65- 70) I completed my masters . I would like to seek advice from folks in the community to understand if pursuing a PhD with research interest in NLP is worth in terms of the opportunity cost, skill set improvement or in terms of my aptitude to work on research problems. I would eventually want to get back into industry post my PhD. Kindly request any advice you would have, I am currently struggling to decide this on my own and really tense. Also, my authorization to continue working in the US is uncertain as my work visa has not been picked twice now.",

Thanks in advance for reading :)\n\nI\u2019ve previously worked in both, purely client-facing & backend development positions, and I've since found myself in a role that involves mixing both those experiences, which is a part of an overall commercially-focused team.\n\nOne world of my responsibilities currently includes working with technical SaaS partners and designing & managing project plans for their dev/product teams to integrate into our platform. There's a lot of peripheral stuff around this as well such as creating documentation & performing quality assurance.\n\nThe other side of my responsibilities involves managing operations & processes of my commercially-leaning team. This includes building processes for incoming business, helping plan compensation structures for fellow team members & improving overall team efficiency through automation.\n\nThis probably sounds strange as there's barely any intersection between the two worlds, but I've somehow found myself here. I do enjoy this combination though, where I get to make use of my technical skills while being in a people-facing role.\n\nI have a few questions and concerns around this, that I'd love to find some answers on:\n\n1. I'm seeing my work being less and less exciting every day. I love growth and hate stagnation. But I'm failing to understand how I can path out my career from here. Are there any similar positions this community is knowledgeable of that makes good use of a developer's technical skills who enjoys working in people-facing positions? I'd love to learn more about those.\n\n2. As clich\u00e9 as it sounds, I'm not happy with my pay. I know for a fact that if I was to leave the company, my responsibilities would need to be backfilled with at least 2 different positions. But there isn't a way for me to understand the current market salaries as I don't know what to compare my salary to. What would be the best way to find out what I should be asking for, and is it okay to use the 'I work 2 positions' talk track?\n\nI'm sure I'll have more questions but I thought a good starting point would be to figure what the hell I'm even doing lol.

I also really like business/entrepreneurship, and ideally would want to fuse the two fields. Overall, I can see myself taking 3 (ideal) paths:\n\n\\- Core programming/SWE: I'd try to break into FAANG and basically just move up the ladder there. This route is obviously the most technical, and from my observations most engineerings plateau at around L5, which still seems to be a relatively coding heavy position. Are there any special skills required for the people who make L6+, technically or otherwise?\n\n\\- Product Management: This ties in with my business interests, but it's also the route I know the least about. What's the field like in comparison to SWE, compensation and mobility wise?\n\n\\- Quant finance: This is another field I've been looking into more and it seems pretty appealing financially. How closely does the work here overlap with traditional SWE stuff for interviews? I know it's a lot more math heavy, but does that dramatically change the hiring process?\n\n\\- Startup: This is obviously the most volatile path, but also the most appealing. This is likely something I need to explore more and learn about in college, but are there any general tips you guys have for getting involved in the space and understanding what I can do? I was thinking of joining VC type clubs to get an idea of the space in a more market focused way.\n\nI'd say I'm generally extrovertedish, and can do leadership and communication heavy tasks, so I wouldn't want to confine myself to just programming if there are other more lucrative paths. Based on my interests, is there anything you guys would recommend I try to do or explore?\n\n\\*Note: I know this might seem kind of premature, but I want to understand the industry more deeply so it's easier for me to plan what I do.",

        "body": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI'm a web developer from the Baltics, EU. I got hired a couple months ago by a local company, this is my first job. When looking for a job, I applied to 2 companies and got a job offer from both of them, I used the offer from the first company to negotiate a better pay from the second company.\r\n\r\nCurrently I make 1550 EUR a month after taxes. I am able to save ~800 EUR every month. I am relatively happy with the salary I get and due to the low const of living here and because I don't have a family, I live rather well. Plus the company only requires me to clock in 7h a day.\r\n\r\nBut the codebase is pretty crummy. They're writing complex financial systems in JavaScript, without tests, without any design patterns, or code reusability. And the security is even worse. Any concerns about it are thrown out the window. In my first job, on my first week I was fixing SQL injection vulnerabilities. If I had not demonstrated that I can drop the whole database with a link, they probably wouldn't have cared or understood. This is obviously just the tip of the iceberg, and every day I keep noticing more security issues.\r\n\r\nI keep reading posts about people just entering the tech scene and having imposter syndrome, I'd love to feel like that. Currently I feel like I'm stagnating, and it really sucks to have to answer to someone who doesn't know what they're doing but has 10+ years of experience. I'll keep looking for other work locally but I am self-taught and only have 2 months of work experience right now :(\r\n\r\nI really feel like I'm wasting my life. Salaries suck in EU compared to US. I'm going to start applying for a GC every year in the lottery, but other than that, I'm really lost and I don't want to work for a second-rate salary in a second-rate country, because I don't think I do second-rate work.\r\n\r\nShould I go to a university, get a master's and aim for an H-1B1? It does seem a bit backwards to go to university after you're a developer already, but if that's what I have to do, then I'm sure I can find enjoyment in it. Any other ways for me to meaningfully advance my career?\r\n\r\nUtmost appreciation for any advice, thank you.",

I passed all my CS classes but never felt like I was great at any of it. Conceptually, I get it. Actually coding? I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m great. In school, I never got good at any specific language and ended up coding in 11 different ones by the time I graduated. \n\nSo I took an IT job because I was laying around super depressed. The pay is low at around 40k. Benefits are good and there\u2019s potential to make real money eventually. Throughout the interview I was very clear that I was interested in other positions and I wanted to develop coding skills since that\u2019s what I went to school for. Now that I\u2019ve been at help desk for several months, I don\u2019t hate it. I\u2019m not wild about the pay but the job is super low stress. I just answer phones, solve problems and write tickets. Easy peasy. Most days I\u2019m alone in the office while everyone else is remote. I have downtime at work where I research stuff I\u2019m interested in. I take walks. It\u2019s nice. \n\nOut of the blue a start up offered me a position that I applied for back in November. The pay is $34 an hour rather than $20 that I\u2019m making now. Similar benefits with the exception of vacation time. My current job offers 5 weeks of vacation to start and it goes up annually. This new job starts at 2 weeks and goes to 3 after a few years. \n\nThe pay is an obvious benefit. It\u2019s roughly $30k more a year. That would be incredible for me right now. I could pay off student loans and buy a home. \n\nThe flip side is, given a few years I think I can make similar pay where I\u2019m at. I don\u2019t see myself being overly stressed. \n\nI feel like if I don\u2019t go for this job that I may not ever be an actual developer. I\u2019m questioning weather I want to be one. I don\u2019t know if this is just imposter syndrome or if I\u2019m just being crazy. \n\nStay at low pay, low stress job?\nRisk taking higher pay, higher stress job where I\u2019m not confident in software development? \n\nAm I being too hard on myself thinking I should know more and be better right off the bat? I feel bad because this particular place has a reputation for being insanely picky about who the hire. It makes me think that I oversold myself in the interview.",

        "body": "I'm a computer science major in their freshman year that just withdrew from a cs course since I was going to fail the class if I didn't. I had a 4.0 GPA the first semester and after withdrawing from this class the second semester I will most likely finish off with a 4.0 GPA again. I will be doing a dev internship this summer and plan on retaking that class as well. Doing poorly was a combination of some life circumstances, burnout, and not spending enough time on that class. Doing this terribly in a class is definitely an anomaly for me and I'm sure I'll be able to do well and get a high grade after retaking it. I'm not sure if I want to go to grad school or not but I'm aware that your grades/GPA will matter quite a bit if you apply for grad school. The one thing I'm the most worried about is how it will affect my future internships and jobs and how employers will feel about my transcript. Will larger tech companies automatically reject me for internships/full-time jobs after seeing a withdraw on my transcript? Would other tech companies do the same?",

He talks shit about the other teams in another country. He also will frequently talk down to me on why I do something. And he also has this horrible habit where he'll ask rhetorical questions or questions that are phrased in such a way where he knows the answer.

        "body": "This is mostly a spite post, but I was also at the lowest point of my life 365 days ago, and it'd be neat if I could help even one person who's in the same position I was a year ago.\n\nMy first job out of college paid $71k in LCOL area. That's the median salary for new SWEs in that city, and I always saw myself as an average person, so I was happy with the median. The company had kind of a bad reputation for giving horrible raises, to the point where new software engineers often made more than ones who'd been there for a few years--because offers for new employees kept up with the market, but raises didn't (A salary for a senior SWE was around $78k, only about 10% more than I was making as a new grad). They also had a nasty penchant for laying off senior engineers and replacing them with busloads of recent college grads. But my plan was to just leave before I became a senior. I was a new grad without a lot of experience so I guess I just didn't think it through.\n\nI graduated January 2020, worked there for a few months until early April 2020, and got positive feedback literally up until the week before I was fired. No one ever communicated to me that I had done anything to put my employment in danger. When I was fired, my manager brought up that I had left work 7 minutes early a month beforehand, and that I had merged my branch into master on Github instead of doing it through the command line *on my literal first day on the job.* It might also be worth pointing out that I'm a woman and that another person from my team was fired that day, also a woman. I don't know if it was a coincidence or not.\n\nIn retrospect, I think this was effectively a layoff. I didn't really see it that way at the time. I kept thinking that I must be so bad at my job if I thought I was doing well but then ended up getting fired. I suffer from low self confidence, and this didn't exactly help.\n\nI managed to get a new job 2 weeks later, making a bit more money in a similar COL area. I excelled at the new company and was given a 4% raise at my performance review, plus a 3.5% bonus. Meanwhile my friends at the old company were telling me that their performance reviews were pushed back multiple times, and when they finally got their raises, they barely even outpaced their rising health insurance costs.\n\nNow that it's been about a year, I decided to start job searching and just signed a 6 figure offer. I never pictured myself making 6 figures, much less that I'd be making that much a mere 18 months after I graduated college. My confidence is at an all-time high, I feel *good* about myself as an engineer for possibly the first time in my entire life, and I'm excited about what the future holds for me.\n\nThe absolute cherry on top is that the average salary for a manager at my previous company is around $90k. I don't just make more than the guy who fired me; I make a *lot* more. Hell, I make more than I likely ever would've made at that company, even if I'd worked there my whole life.\n\nThe message I hope anyone struggling takes away from this is that no one manager or company can define your value! Getting fired was the absolute best thing that ever happened to me. I really don't know how much time I would've wasted in that horrible, toxic environment before I got it together and left on my own. I can't believe the difference 365 days can make, and I'm so, *so* grateful that I didn't let my old manager destroy my confidence.",

I\u2019ll also need to prepare myself for the journey ahead when I\u2019ll apply to full time jobs which is why I want to give CodePath a shot, but the problem is that there could be time conflicts such as the program normally starting at 10 AM, but my internship will start at 9 AM.

        "body": "I'm about to graduate from a top tier engineering school with a CS degree and 2 years of experience working at a startup. I'm also a high ranked competitive coder, and completed a lot of large projects by myself. While interviewing for jobs, I got an offer at my dream company (which is a very well know company). The offer was amazing, the salary was more than I could ask for, and MY RECRUITER TOLD ME I WOULD BE STAFFED IN NYC. They said this verbally and over email multiple times. They told me to not worry about my contract saying I'd work in SF. Apparently all the contracts say that. I signed the offer, and stopped interviewing at all the companies that were interviewing me.\n\nI was very clear to them that I needed to work in NYC. It was the number one priority for me, and I would not have accepted the offer were it not in NYC.\n\nI get an email from the company last week saying \"Congratulations! We staffed you on this team in SF. We're so excited for you to start!\" Like they had no idea that I was going to be crushed by this news. I of course replied with a polite, \"what the hell?\". But they didn't respond for a few days and when they did, they ignored and diverted all of concerns. I eventually begged them to staff me in NYC. I finally got a call with the Lead Staffing decision person, and they did not listen to a word I said, and kept trying to convince me why SF was great, and why their staffing algorithm is a faultless and superior entity. So now I either work for them in SF or I don't work for them.\n\nI'm pretty mad that a company would conduct itself this way before I even got there. It's really ridiculous that I was lied to about information that was going to have a huge affect on my personal life. Additionally, by waiting this long to tell me, they avoided me getting a job in a location that was actually preferable to me. It was manipulative and it makes me want to quit already, but I really don't have time to get another job so I'm not sure what to do.",

I even felt that way in college; I hated labs and group work and greatly preferred being independent.\n\nI also liked the more reactive nature of support than the proactive nature of software engineering. I enjoyed being given a problem and fixing/solving it and moving onto the next one. The support work just seems to fit my personality much better.\n\nBut at the same time, software engineering is objectively a better career; more money, more exposure, more opportunities, etc. I can't shake the feeling that making this move is just a bad idea.

I talked to their development lead and the CTO/founder, breezed through the coding challenges, and basically everyone seemed really great and their stack is right up my alley. But the problem is that while the salary is definitely in the top of my range, their HR sent me an exploding offer (24 hours) and I had to rush through the benefits guide, where I discovered that their retirement and vacation/time-off is pretty crappy. Since I had such a short deadline to accept, I accepted and signed since it was my best offer to-date, and I really do like the people. Also it\u2019s completely remote which I do like.\n\nAnyway, the offer is contingent upon background check, etc. So I have continued to finish my ongoing interviews while that process is happening, just in case anything happens, and at the end of this week I received another offer. \n\nThis one is a super cool role with a small team at a huge auto firm, and while I\u2019d be using tech I know, they also want me to learn a bunch of other things and grow with the role. There are much better learning opportunities with this role, and while the salary is largely the same as my other offer, the benefits are much better. The problem is that I\u2019d be working through a staffing company and not directly with the client company, and they\u2019re not known for hiring their contractors. Not that they get rid of them or anything, but the company seems comfortable keeping this arrangement long-term. Like there are other people that currently work there from my same staffing agency I\u2019m going through, and they have been there for years and years. Also it would be on-site after covid.\n\nWhat would any of you do in this situation? I\u2019m trying to make a rational decision for myself, but it\u2019s becoming difficult to wrap my head around which would be better for my career. I feel like the role with the big firm would look much more impressive on my resume in the future, but the smaller firm might fit better with my personality and would still be beneficial, though not as much. Also the staffing agency situation is iffy with the big firm and doesn\u2019t inspire a lot of confidence. But the benefits are hands-down better with the big firm. And, perhaps most frighteningly, I\u2019d have to renege on the small firm and I\u2019ve never done that before. And it honestly scares me.\n\nJust looking for opinions. Which would any of you personally do?",

I asked them if a change back to my original role was possible and the reply wasn't very reassuring.\n\nI don't know what to do now.

I was recently offered a paid research mentor position over the summer and complete a research project in urban ecology with a group of high school seniors, but I am not sure if I should accept it or if I should look for opportunities more directly related to the fields I'm interested in. \n\nI have enjoyed working with younger students in the past but I don't know if I'm super interested in urban ecology or if that's something that I would like to do post graduation. Right now I think I'd like to go to grad school and study urban informatics (hence the American Studies and CS double major) and then do data analysis for either some non-profit or government agency, and I don't know if this will really help me do that. \n\nI already have some experience in data analysis. Last summer I worked as a data analysis intern for my school's IT department (but I mainly used Excel and Power BI to build some reports for them). And soon I will complete this two month long research workshop on machine learning, and I just started working in one of my school's data mining labs. \n\nSo I don't know if I should just take the money from this urban ecology research opportunity ($5k+), bank on my other data analysis experience, and then try to get an internship more directly linked to my interests for the summer going into my senior year, or if I should bail on the urban ecology research and try to do something that is directly related to my interests for this summer to make sure I don't waste my second to last summer before graduation. What should I do? Is research in an unrelated field, viewed positively by tech employers or grad schools? Is it not worth it to still work with high school students going into my junior year of college? Any advice would be appreciated!",

        "body": "**TLDR:** There's a lot of variance in industry experience. No matter what your background is, you can find a way to both break into the industry as well as get the job \"of your dreams\" whatever that might be.\n\nBackground: I'm 32 years old from the US. I got a late start to my 'career', because I never had true direction when I was studying, neither in high school nor at University. During my 4th year at Uni, I studied abroad in Spain for a year, just so I could have the experience. I met my now wife there. After returning 'home', I finished 2 degrees in 1 semester (Economics and Spanish). No internships. No Coops. No industry-related experience. I followed my girlfriend to her home country, where she had found work.\n\nThings took a whole different turn then, because we decided to make our relationship work before everything else. I found it literally impossible to find work there. It took me years of bouncing between countries, taking on small roles in unrelated industries. Eventually, I did find work at a startup.\n\nFast forward, and we were living in Hawaii, where I decided to pick up web development. Yes, web developers are a dime a dozen; but so are the jobs, and the ability to work remotely was precisely why I decided to go into it. Hawaii (Kauai) doesn't have a lot of jobs for technically-minded people. Also the money doesn't seem too bad.\n\nBut most importantly, because I actually did, in fact, fall in love with programming.\n\nIt took me more than 2 long years of self-study, networking, project-building, and portfolio-building to land my first contract with a friend. No income (except some substitute teaching and some side jobs). LOTS of familial stress.\n\nI'm not a 10x programmer. I don't have all that much to devote to studying outside of work hours. And I'm not the smartest guy. But I didn't give up.\n\nJust before we left Hawaii, I got my first lucrative job as a remote contractor.\n\nThat was 6 months ago.\n\nYesterday, I started my first role as a full-time employee at a small, **very** cool dev shop, title of Frontend Developer. The pay is above-average for the region and COL.\n\nI've had 3 contracts and now this full-time position. Hundreds of applications for roles of all levels, but almost exclusively remote (out of necessity).\n\nFor all the offers I accepted, my bosses have **always** been happy with my work and have left me great references. And during interviews for those jobs, I barely had any technical assessments to do.\n\nNo Leetcode. No DSA questions.\n\nThat said, I've had to implement interesting algorithms with Graphs and Trees, so knowing DSA was certainly helpful; however, for getting the job, it wasn't necessary.\n\nThat's my experience in a nuthshell. I hope it adds just a bit more context for the job market out there.",

        "title": "An In-Depth Rundown of Hack Reactor (1st line of JavaScript to 6-figure salary in 10 months)",
        "body": "Hey all. I just finished a successful job search, and in reflecting on the past year, I thought that it might be useful to put my timeline down here for others who might be thinking of switching careers.\n\nI won't bore you with my story except to say that I come from a performing arts background, and had just finished up school when coronavirus essentially knocked the whole industry out. No coding experience besides one semester of Python which I remembered nothing of.\n\nIf you're reading this trying to decide if programming is for you, there's really only three things I can think of that are necessary to be a good programmer. If you are someone who:\n\n* enjoys creative problem solving (no math necessary)\n* enjoys self-learning\n* has a great work ethic\n\n...then you can make it. No question. The rest of this very long post will tell it in detail, but the above is the heart of it.\n\n# Initial Prep\n\nI wrote my first line of JavaScript in June last year. I spent three months going through HR's resources and all the JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React.JS sections of FreeCodeCamp before taking HR's entrance exam in September. I used only those resources and worked around 3-4 hours a day max, taking lots of notes.\n\nThe entrance exam consists of only JavaScript - around twelve questions of increasing difficulty. Essentially nobody finishes this exam - it's to find where you're at. I made it through ten questions in the allotted time.\n\n# Precourse\n\nAn initial note: HR updates their curriculum almost monthly, so don't expect exact matches for the things described from here on out.\n\nOn being accepted to the program and paying a deposit, Hack Reactor provides you mandatory precourse material to complete in the three weeks leading up to the start date. The material is heavily varied, ranging from re-implementing JS libraries and functions to building a very limited Twitter clone from a template.\n\nThe work is difficult. It's built to challenge people with various levels of experience - mandatory basic requirements, followed by optional advanced reqs. I knew many people who did the precourse more than once before they were comfortable beginning the true program - most everyone who redid it only took it again once, but I do know someone who did it over again twice.\n\n# Hack Reactor\n\nI did all of the program completely remote from home. Expect to do nothing else during these three months - it's around 10 hours a day of scheduled work, six days a week. It's a lot.\n\nHR's three months are split into two phases: a junior and a senior phase. Junior phase focuses on learning technologies, and senior focuses on building websites with those technologies. An assessment is given once a week to gauge progress, and a major technical assessment is given at the end of junior phase which determines if you can proceed to senior phase.\n\n# Junior Phase\n\nTopics covered include:\n\n* JavaScript fundamentals\n* Node.JS and HTTP servers\n* Databases, SQL\n* Asynchronous code and making API calls\n* React.JS\n\nEvery day begins with an hour allotted to algorithms practice. In junior phase, the main work is done in two day sprints with a partner. Each sprint is formatted like those in precourse - an assignment with basic reqs and advanced reqs for those who finish earlier, and then an additional 'nightmare mode' for those who blaze through the material.\n\nA standard day roughly consists of:\n\nAlgorithms (1hr) -> Lecture (45min) -> Sprint Assignment (2.5 hr) -> break -> Lecture/Office Hours (45 min) -> Sprint (3 hr) -> break -> Sprint (1hr)\n\nUsually, sprints begin with a high level lecture on the content, followed by pair programming for the rest of the two days, interspersed with other lectures. At the end of a sprint, solutions are provided and final office hours are held with the instructors for clarifying questions.\n\nDuring every sprint, a help desk is available for when you get stuck. I used it very liberally. Even so, the bulk of the learning is done simply through exploring the assignment with your partner. It can be extremely frustrating and slow work, with lots of Google searches. This is by design: 75% of the real job is being good at finding the correct resource to solve whatever problem you have. HR forces its students to develop this skill by giving them slightly less information than necessary to complete the assignment.\n\nI want to reiterate how awful this experience frequently is. But it's absolutely necessary. I once spent a whole Sunday re-doing an entire sprint because I'd gotten myself stuck on all the wrong things until I saw the solution and realized I did it all wrong. I will never, ever make those mistakes again.\n\n# Senior Phase\n\nConsists of building out a front end, a scaled back end, and a passion project. Topics include:\n\n* Git team workflow\n* Styling with CSS\n* Deployment (AWS)\n* Scaling (caching, load-balancing, optimization)\n* Testing\n\nPassing junior phase means you've learned most of the technologies necessary to build a website well enough to do it in a real job. So that's what you do in senior phase, with a team of four people.\n\nThe Front end capstone is a clone of one page from a popular website. Each team member takes one quarter of the page as a module, builds out the business logic, and styles it, before putting them all together.\n\nDuring the Back end design capstone, teams are shuffled, and each team takes one of the finished projects and builds it to scale, with the goal of being able to sustain 1000 requests per second on AWS instances.\n\nThe final project is a solo work of your choosing with no restrictions besides creating a complete, minimum viable product. I spent an enormous amount of time on these three projects, keeping in mind that these would be the only examples of my work for employers to potentially see.\n\n# Job Search\n\nIn the final week of the program, career advisors help you polish out your resume and provide a gameplan for job seeking. HR additionally provides you three months of support from these career advisors AFTER the program ends, which I found invaluable.\n\nDuring the search itself, the advice is to bulk apply to five jobs a day and to email recruiters at every company down the line until you get a response. I didn't do that at first, and honestly it was my loss. As an example: a colleague who followed through with that schedule had nine interviews a month into his search. Crazy.\n\nI, on the other hand, spent most of my time grinding Leetcode problems. I did 4-8 a day for a month, and felt extremely confident about my coding skills, but had no interviews. After I wised up and started doing more outreach, I finally got lucky and landed some interviews in late February. I prepped behavioral questions with my career advisor and my friends, kept up with algorithms, and aced the interviews.\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nMaking a career change is a leap of faith. I had enough confidence in my learning abilities that I thought I'd be okay even without the best instruction, and to be frank I wouldn't rank HR's teachers super high. However, this ends up being a moot point because the curriculum itself is genuinely world class. Just surviving the grueling hours required to complete the basic requirements of each assignment prepares you for precisely what work in the industry actually looks like. Few people feel great about their skills during the program, but afterwards my colleagues I've spoken to have all felt very prepared in their respective jobs.\n\nI can't understate though - it's a huge amount of work, and a huge time commitment. We had at least one person drop out every week or two. But my cohort had folks from all sorts make it through the program. 20 year olds, 40 year olds, slow, fast, new, experienced - you name it. If you're willing and able to make it through, you can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBiggest complaints:\n\n* Everyone is stretched thin, so help is available but sometimes you really just have to figure things out on your own.\n* Not enough feedback on the quality of code you write (I relied on ESLint and my own judgement)\n* Not much algorithms focus. (But there really weren't enough hours in the day)\n\nBiggest takeaways:\n\n* A network of engineer friends to ask for help\n* Knowing exactly how to negotiate and talk with recruiters\n* Total confidence in being able to learn any new software\n* ... and of course, the big tech salary :)\n\nFeel free to ask any questions, and hit me up in the DMs if you have really specific stuff to ask. I'm grateful to have found some success and I'd be thrilled to pay it forward!",

The most transferable skills I have is experience configuring web application servers/VMs, troubleshooting data issues, working with Oracle databases and schema, and some basic SQL.\n\nSince covid began (or a bit earlier than that) I've been steadily learning computer science and programming with the hope that I start job hunting in early July and becoming a full fledged developer by November of this year. I started with Java but have naturally begun to focus on front end stacks like JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and React. I went through my university's publically available courses on computer science just to make sure I have at least some understanding of the theory. I have about 3 projects done where I showcase some basic skills in handling events, fetching API and doing some basic async stuff, manipulating DOMs, instantiating my own objects and working with them. I feel like there is still so much ground for me to cover in terms of JavaScript fundamentals... like what is classical inheritance, what are prototypes, the pillars of OOP, etc.\n\nMy question is, where should I go from here? \n\nBetween learning more JavaScript fundamentals, learning new tech (like AJAX, jQuery, php, Node.js), studying algorithms and data structure (which I haven't started yet), and outputting more projects, I really want insider opinions from current developers or people who have made the transition on what I should focus on next.\n\nTo complicate things a little more, although there are some great paying Junior front end roles, I've also seen alot of shockingly low front end salaries in my city (Vancouver, Canada)...like 35k/40k/45k. That is probably too big of a paycut for me to stomach. So wherever I land my first Dev role, I really need the salary to at the very least be in the range of 55k+.",

        "body": "Was put on  PIP, didn't finish all items fully and didn't change my work ethic either. I did bare minimum all the while taking and prepping for interviews. Surprisingly, nothing happened... was told I would be re evaluated at the end of PIP, but it came and went, and they didn't even mention it to me at all since.\n\nPretty much all of my coworkers work late into the night sometimes and always do during crunch time. After awhile of that, I said screw it, and decided to log off at five everyday, crunch time or no. Got put on PIP after several months of that and told to improve due to performance. If given work close to end of day, I would start on it the next morning or next Monday. I started valuing my time and re evaluated my relationship with said employer.\n\nShortly after being given PIP, a mass exodus of key and very tenured personnel took place due to burn out. Without them, company is body without a head so to speak ATM. I'm actually treated well now, which is perplexing, since the usual treatment is more of disdain when they're not fully satisfied with my work.\n\nWhy is nothing happening after PIP due date? Is that normal? Did they never intend to terminate in the first place? My guess would be, yes, because I joined a few years ago, and my salary has not increased by much since then. If they were to hire someone with same YOE now, they would have to pay 30% more, and that's without domain experience with their particular product. Another guess would be they're waiting for the dust to settle before pulling the trigger. Since so many have left, if they also fire someone now, would it reflect badly on management?\n\nUpdate: Got terminated after 2-3 weeks. I guess this is common. I guess they were busy with other things since then.",

I have been looking for potential jobs and most data analysts jobs or business related jobs want either a clean record or some sort of experience with different computer languages. I have taken one class in python and attempted to take the 2nd in series but they changed to java and I ended up getting to far behind and bogged down. I ended up dropping it because I had been neglecting my other classes too much and was at risk of failing them. I enjoyed it but I didn't have the luxury of devoting all my time to it. I would like to go back and redo the class in the future. \n\nAnyway, I guess what my question is, what should I do with my life? I don't want to be one of these people who graduates and stays employed as a barista or some other minimum wage occupation. Originally I wanted to be a an actuary but I am felon and I struggle with math. I really don't want to be in school anymore and just want a good paying job in something that I can enjoy. I am currently in the process of expunging my record. \n\nAnother question I have is what avenue should I take when it comes to learning programing? Should I take a boot camp or should I go another route? What kind of jobs are out there in the programing world and what should I do to obtain them? \n\nLiterally, I am completely lost on what I should for a career. This is really starting to stress me out. I have talked to the career center at school and they seem to be geared more toward 20 year olds who have no records. Also they are not career experts, they are just people who needed a job and got this one. When I tell them about my criminal past they are completely dumbfounded and have no idea what to do or say that can help me. I am just shook that I could be the only person they have encountered with a criminal past. I have a 2004 burglary charge and a petty theft in 2009. I have posted 2 posts about this on r/jobs and r/college. I have also talked with the econ department and 2 professors. No one seems to know anything about being a felon who is trying to get out of the retail/service industry.  This is why I am trying to post my question her in the hopes that something someone says will give me an idea on where to focus my energy.

Do these people not realize they're going to get a bunch of liars applying if they do this?\n* I'm tired of interviewing some PhD or academic who has worked only with other academics, only for them to talk down on me because I don't know something I should've somehow remembered from university years ago that could be googled in 30 seconds. Who on earth are these people trying to find? Jesus? Their level of expectations is outrageous. Have they seriously forgotten what it was like to just not focus on academics for a few months and forget small details of things?\n* I'm tired of HR offering me interviews to different positions than the one I applied for. I applied to that position for a reason. If I wanted a different position, I would have applied for it\n* I hate how HR are the first people to screen resumes. I couldn't begin to imagine, without a tech background, how they decide which ones are good versus which ones are full of lies\n* I hate how I have to provide my salary expectations on the job application.

So far I'm getting a lot of support for UIUC and UT, but I would need to internal transfer to CS for UT and UIUC is estimated $55k per year (can be brought down to around 46k by living off campus).\n\nMy goal is to major in computer science, minor in math, and become a quantitative analyst/developer. I know that math is a stronger pipeline into the field, but I really like the flexibility that a computer science major has. With this in mind, I'm still contemplating which college I should go to.\n\nI want to emphasize that I want to become a quantitative analyst/developer because I know that where you go for your undergraduate education doesn't matter for other careers such as software engineering.\n\nThe colleges I'm looking at are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# UIUC\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Accepted to computer science + economics\n* [Ranked #5](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings) in computer science by U.S. News & World Report\n* Near Chicago\n* Quant firms recruit from here\n* Fantastic research/internship opportunities\n* Fantastic computer science program\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Estimated $55k a year to attend!\n* Would most likely not pursue a master's degree because of the tuition I would pay for undergraduate\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Texas A&M\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Would be able to pursue the computer science major after my freshman year\n* [Ranked #11](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/eng-rankings) for best engineering school by U.S. News & World Report\n* Networking through the Aggie Network\n* Accepted to engineering honors (priority registration for classes and other benefits)\n* Estimated $18k a year\n* Would be able to afford pursing a master's degree\n\n**Cons**\n\n* First year would be spent in general engineering\n* Not as well recognized outside of Texas\n* [Ranked #43](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings) in computer science by U.S. News & World Report\n* Haven't heard much about quant firms recruiting from here\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# UT Austin\n\n**Pros**\n\n* [Ranked #10](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings) in computer science by U.S. News & World Report\n* In Austin!!!\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Was not accepted to computer science (accepted to liberal arts undeclared)\n* Immensely difficult to internal transfer to computer science\n* First year would be spent in liberal arts\n* Have the risk of being stuck in liberal arts and majoring in economics\n* Estimated $28k a year (not too bad, but definitely worse than A&M)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was honestly leaning towards Texas A&M because I heard that where you go to get your undergraduate education doesn't matter in general and that it's about how you network/build your resume. Although, hearing that undergraduate does have some importance for quant specifically is making me change my mind.\n\nIf going to UIUC means I can get into quant straight from undergraduate by working hard, then I would choose UIUC. If a master's degree is more important, then I would go to Texas A&M, work to get a graduate degree at a top school, and then work to get into quant. I wouldn't want to go to UT and have the potential of being stuck in liberal arts, but if you guys have reasons for why it may be worth it, then I would like to hear them.\n\nJust to clarify, internal transfer to UTCS is incredibly competitive with a 4.0 gpa not even guaranteeing admission, and it's even worse for external transfer.\n\nI would like some advice on this decision and thank you for taking the time to read this post.",

        "body": "So, in around a month I will be finally graduating college with a bachelors in Computer Engineering. With this, I am actually looking in going the software route, since I pretty much fell in love with C/C# programing. The problem I am having is finding jobs that are hiring people with little to no experience outside of college.\n\nI have plenty of experience in other fields, being a 5 year active veteran of the Marine Corps as a military police officer, and also having another associates degree in Criminal Justice. While I was in the Marines, I decided to take a different route and pursue something that I would love to do the rest of my life, which is work on computers. Not only that, for most of my college career, I worked part time at a chain hardware store here. It was the first job I found and since the hours were extremely flexable, I ended up staying there instead of trying to find something more in range with being a computer engineer.  So since I don't have any experience outside of college in CS/CE, I've been heavily marketing myself in being versatile and able to work well with a team and other cultures due to my military experience.\n\nI've been applying to jobs once or twice a week since October, with ramping up to about 4 times a week a month ago. Since I have to stay in the area for the next 2 years because my girlfriend has 2 more years of school until she gets her doctorate, I've been applying locally and for remote positions throughout the United States. But even with that amount of jobs, I have only had 3 phone interviews, in which only one of them contacted me back stating they were pursuing other candidates, and the other 2 completely ghosting me all-together.\n\nSo the main question is, how can I market myself better and what advice do yall have in convincing employers that I would be a good candidate to invest in?\n\nEdit: Also, will employers take me a little more serious once I graduate?",

I just feel I guess nervous, if not even incompetent, since this isn't the role or exact field I've trained for, and also the circumstance with this being all remote. Nothing wrong with the teams/people I work with (we've rotated a bit too). I guess I feel this way because I really don't know what I'm doing right now and don't know how to remediate this, other than trying to continue to learn on my own, and through the slow osmosis as I hear other people talk or see them chat. \n\nEvery day I'm currently in a DSU with seasoned professionals and I feel like I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing and I guess because that's the actual case.  I'm trying to make myself useful in other ways too. \n\nHow do you deal with this? This is contract work, so each person in my contracting company is on different projects.  So I never even talk to people within my own company per se.  I have a small team and they are newer like me and are with different contracting companies.  No one would see it as their position to train/mentor me, in that sense.  I appreciate the confidence in me in hiring me and I know I'm certainly am blessed for it.

I am specializing in machine learning and have also TA'ed for a few ML classes. I am also working a data analyst side-hustle.\n\nI have been applying and interviewing since September of last year. I have submitted over 200 apps since then. I got off to a rocky start acclimating to interviewing but have got some traction recently and have 4 offers on the table. They are:\n\n* DOD - Software Engineer - $80k\n* Controls and automation firm - Lead Software Engineer - $95k\n* Telecom Infrastructure - Technical Sale Lead - $85k + commission\n* Big-4 Accounting - Data Scientist - $83k\n\nTruthfully, I am disappointed with the salary for each of them. The most appealing offer is the Big-4 Data Scientist role but the salary seems very low especially since it is in a mid-high COL area.\n\nAm I expecting too much in terms of salary? I feel like with my background I should be able to land offers at $100k+. I often see fresh bachelor grads on here and in my personal life landing $100k+ gigs. Meanwhile I have 5+ years of work experience plus a Master's with a perfect academic record and I'm just not getting there. \n\nI have had very little traction with big tech companies. I rarely get any response. When I do hear back I rarely get past the online assessments even though I complete them with optimal or close to optimal solutions. My one thought is I am disadvantaged because I don't have internship experience. This is because I have been working full time in my PM job which I feel should be just as valuable experience-wise. I have also been trying to round out my resume with TA experience and my side hustle.\n\nI just feel very discouraged.

        "title": "A bad decision was made before I arrived at a company. People are (slowly) starting to realise it was bad. How do I best handle this situation?",
        "body": "In January I took a lead backend engineering role at a fintech startup, who recently secured their Series A. \n\nThis is my first startup job, previously I'd worked in a classical Microsoft enterprise. In that role, I oversaw the refactoring of a 1M+ LOC winforms ERP app. When I started with that app, there was an MSSQL trigger named `Pricing____YEEEEEHAAAAAAWWWW`\\*, that had critical business logic; and no-one made any changes for fear of breaking things. Most of the dev teams work was data fixes - writing SQL migrations to fix specific cases where the data was wrong. Over 18 months I decoupled the business logic from both the database and the UI, migrated to .Net Core (one of the biggest performance gains I've ever seen at once), and through refactoring/testing got the pace of development to an all time high. The improvement was enough for the organisation to abandon a planned \u00a32M replacement, and I left because they offered me \u00a315k (more) and wouldn't put me on a bonus track.\n\nWhen I arrived at the startup, I wasn't surprised to find them in a similar position. Fortunately, there were no triggers; but their first iteration had the same bidirectional coupling between the UI and the business logic. There were no tests. They were just wrapping up a year-long project to rewrite the UI, which was mainly a redesign.\n\nShortly before I arrived they decided to rewrite the API. They termed this as a 'refactor', and I was hired to lead it. To make matters worse, they had already decided to change the surface API _and_ the database. This commits us to a tricky database migration _and_ integration hell. We had also made completing this a Q1 goal.\n\nWhen I arrived, I tried to persuade my boss that this was a bad idea. I was told that refactoring was impossible and unachievable, and it would take longer than rewriting because the app was so small. My direct experience to the contrary was not considered, I had no choice but to go along with it. \n\nProgress on the rewrite has been reasonable. I think we've done 80% of the work, we just have the other 80% to go. I've been able to implement a layered modular architecture, and my boss respects my architectural decisions reasonably well. \n\nUnfortunately, I feel like I am being consistently undermined on many other programming decisions. Some of these I've been able to fight back against, others less so. This is a topic for another time, but I've had to fight hard for unit tests, and we're still insisting on using an ORM's 'synchronise' feature to manage the database!\\*\\* (Side note: if anyone's had this kind of experience and would feel like offering some time to talk to me about this one-on-one, please reach out to me. I'm going insane, and I'd really appreciate it.)\n\nIncidentally, the new UI was deployed to production a few weeks ago. As expected, there were bugs on bugs on bugs. Non-tech teams grew frustrated with bugs when using the app, and those reported by our end users. I should note we aren't a consumer platform - our accounts start at $15k recurring. We have a small customer pool who talk a lot, so reputation really matters.\n\nIn our _end of Q1_ meeting this week, our COO mentioned that he was frustrated with experience of deploying the new UI. He wanted to know what we were doing to prevent this from happening when we released the new API. A new executive hire confided that he feels this rewrite is a mistake. On the board, I think I have 3/5 now at least secretly agreeing with me, one disagrees, and HR is oblivious.\n\nI'm not actively fueling this sentiment, but I have a hard time fighting against it. I know the migration is going to be tortuous. Because we're changing the database, we'll have to migrate everything at once. No amount of testing is going to stop us having bugs here.\n\nAbout that Q1 launch goal? Well, it was obviously unrealistic, so now it's Q2. And now the true curse of rewrites has sunk in - we're going to have to resume development of the original API, because the backlog of feature requests has just grown too much. Growing organisational goals are adding pressure on me to commit to releasing in Q2. I don't think it's possible.\n\nI honestly believe that if we chalked up the rewrite as a learning experience now, and committed to refactoring the current codebase, we'd have it completed in Q2. Along the way, we'd continue to deliver value with new features, and we'd have no integration hell.\n\nI feel completely stuck on this. My experience is discarded. I've been put in charge of a project that I feel has a 0% chance of success, with a high sunk cost. If I make it clear I think Q2 is unrealistic, I'll get another developer, because everyone knows [more developers yield faster results, _right_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law)? \n\nObviously I could be wrong about all of this. The rewrite may continue to go smoothly and integrate well. But there are too many red flags about this, way more than I've written here, for me not to be stressing.\n\nAll sorts of engineering wisdom are just getting ignored. Proper handling of database version control? No, we're modern and use modern 'tools' instead, unlike those DBA-hiring neanderthals. Make small, measurable changes to production? Sure, we'll just make loads at once.\n\nThe best result for me is the best result for the company. We had no shortage of investors for the series A, in part because our customers include VC's. The culture is excellent, and while I'm frustrated with my bosses technical decisions I still like him. Superficially the platform looks great.\n\nI feel like I have two extreme choices here:\n\n- Accept the current state, and make the best of it. \n- Exert influence and push to abandon the rewrite, and focus on refactoring.\n\nThe best solution likely is somewhere in between. What do you think is best?\n\n\n\\* I have a photo of it, I actually looked it up before posting, and this was its real name.\n\n\\*\\* \"Don't worry, if a deployment causes data loss we'll just rollback to the latest backup.\" To hell with other concerns.",

        "body": "To give background, I am a Middle Eastern living in a Western country. When I was a freshman in high school, I wrote a comment on some international news site where I basically referred to the Israeli military as terrorists. I was stupid enough to use my real name, and years later I made an attempt to wipe myself off any social media. Now if someone googled my name, they'll come across my LinkedIn and academic/research related stuff. Unfortunately, if they go to the next page, they will see the cached page of this link with my name and comment there in bold. \n\nI tried my best to hide all of this and was hoping that it gets buried by more positive and professional records. Today, however, I was shocked when my friend told me he knew about this comment and that it is likely the probable cause of all my internship rejections (as well as past rejections for other things), as i have never disclosed this to anyone I know. I have had live interviews for multiple companies this past few months that I thought went well, only to be surprised that I was rejected (and with them basically ghosting me after inquiring on skill-sets that i can improve on). \n\nI know that employers search up job applicants, but it scares me that this is something that can basically shut off any chance I have in this industry for life. My friend is suggesting that i change my legal name and clean my slate for good, but I don't know if I am just overthinking this.\n\nI know that hiring teams do search up job applicants, but how far do they go in this? Do they just do a google search and do a quick swipe at the first page? Do they care about old controversial comments, especially if it was from years ago? I really have no idea how to get this removed.\n\nEdit: Yes, my name is quite unique unfortunately, so it\u2019d almost definitely be linked back to me.\n\nEdit: I just tried searching my name again, and to my horror, that link is now at the very bottom of the first Google search page, and my name and comment are written in bold in the short text below the link. So it is absolutely being seen by recruiters. I do not live in Europe unfortunately so the right to be forgotten doesn\u2019t apply to me. I sent an email to the site itself asking them to remove the cached  page, but I haven\u2019t received a response yet. F :/",

        "body": "Hi all, I apologize for the open-endedness of the question, but hopefully it makes sense in a moment. For background, I am a recent cs graduate and am currently looking for work in software engineering. \n\nI focused largely on a single research project as an undergrad, and do not have any internships or major personal projects to speak of. This being the case, I am aware that I should be careful about my expectations as to what a reasonable job offering is and avoid having lofty expectations for my position. \n\nThis comes into play currently, because I have recently received a job offer for a position that I am not necessarily enthusiastic about, but at the same time, I have nothing to compare it to, and I wanted to ask for advice from those who are more experienced in the field/industry on where my expectations should be. \n\nIt is a consulting position, and having lurked for some time on this sub, I have seen many mixed responses to this. I would not necessarily mind the position, but I feel I would be better suited to a position more focused around SWE, and think that my career would benefit from such as well. I am concerned about going into consulting and getting funneled into roles that would take me further from software development.\n\nI have made it through varying stages of interviews with other tech companies, but the consulting position is my first offer at the end. I feel that I am a decent programmer, and have a solid grasp on the various material from the curriculum, but again, my exposure is limited to just that. I would not consider myself a rockstar by any means either, but I am certain that I would be able to contribute substantially to a company in a software engineering role.\n\nMy main question is this: Would turning down this offer be greedy/arrogant of me given my position? \n\nI do not mean to overestimate my \"value\" to a company (nor would I want to underestimate it, of course), but at the same time, I wanted to know if I should continue looking for better opportunities or instead go with the bird in the hand. I would hate to turn the offer down, only for it to be one of the best available offers to someone in my position.\n\nI am unsure of what I should be looking for out of an initial career. Obviously median/average salaries come into play, benefits, other forms of compensation, etc., but I have no frame of reference on what would be low or high ball offers besides the more accessible values like salary or time off. I understand that it is unlikely for there to be a perfect consensus regardless, but any information on what I should look for would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAll advice is welcome, and I can provide more information if necessary.",

        "body": "I am comfortable with C++. I know Qt exists for desktop development, but I am looking for something with less expensive licensing for commercial apps.\n\nIt would be ideal if I know how to write create desktop as well as mobile applications for all major operating systems. I am considering C# because it would allow me to create cross-platform desktop apps using .NET core. It would also allow me to create mobile apps for iOS and Android using Xamarin's native frameworks. So as I see it, C# will allow me to hit all forms of app development. I will just have to learn different frameworks, which seems easier than learning an entirely new language.\n\nI am hesitant because I read somewhere that .NET core isn't actually good outside Windows, even though it is cross-platform. Apparently, GUI components are not up to the mark on Linux. I also read somewhere that it is difficult to develop mobile apps using Xamarin because there is a severe scarcity of high-quality resources teaching Xamarin online. Additionally, I also read that apps created using Xamarin will not be able to access phone hardware like camera and will have very low performance compared to apps written in native languages. \n\nI am confused because I have also read that Xamarin and .NET are awesome. I am confused. Too much conflicting information.\n\nI don't want to compromise on the performance and UI sophistication of my applications. While it would be ideal to be able to create apps for as many platforms as possible, I am willing to narrow myself to just android if it means keeping the quality significantly higher compared to cross-platform. So if I go down this path, should I choose Kotlin or Java? Kotlin seems more productive and less verbose, but people say that you can't really understand Android development if you skip Java. It seems like Java will be dead in a decade. Kotlin seems more compact and productive. So Java just seems like an extra step.\n\nTo sum up, I have the following questions:\n\n1. Is .NET core good for cross-platform desktop applications? Will it look and perform well?\n2. Is Xamarin.Native as good as native languages and frameworks for mobile app development? Does it have the same performance? Can the app access mobile hardware?\n3. Is Xamarin easy to learn for a new programmer? \n4. As someone with no mobile application development experience, should I start with Kotlin directly? Will I be able to learn Android development properly without Java?",

It's a SWE intern role at a great local company and I'm fairly confident it's going to give me a lot of really great, directly applicable full-stack experience. I currently have an internship doing very basic automated front-end testing and some full-stack (i.e. small projects on both) development (small team).\n\nHowever, I got an interview at a really great company with a really great team for a junior test engineer position. They like to start people there, and people don't stay in that role for more than \\~a year, less if you are good and express interest. You can then either stay in QA (regular level) or move to junior software developer, it's basically a dedicated program/pipeline. I'm going to get more information in the next interview, but based on interview #1 and people I know who work there, I probably would only be in test for a few months, maybe 6. However, this position starts \\~in a month, so it's this OR my internship. \n\nThe explanation of the tasks that testers do to transition into junior dev roles sound almost exactly like what I'm currently doing at my current internship. I.e., I kind of think I might be qualified for that junior dev role right now.\n\nThe interview was probably  one of the best I've ever had and we are already talking about start dates, benefits, compensation prior to the second interview. Today's guy basically expressed that the second interview is a technicality at this point, but it's still not a guarantee I guess.\n\nI don't want to work in test, but I also am fairly confident (as confident as you can be) that I would move into a dev role in this company in a few months. My questions are: \n\n* Say I got a junior dev role there, would I still run the risk of being pigeonholed in QA *after*, if I was looking for a dev role elsewhere? \n* Should I keep the internship, or go with this position if they offer it to me?\n* I really like this company, what can I do here? lol\n\n(Throwaway for privacy purposes)",

        "body": "Hello. I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student and I am currently an intern. I'm going anonymous for obvious reasons.\n\nSo I've known a recruiter for 2-3 years now and I keep applying to their company (called X) as an intern. I get to see them every year at university recruitment events or events that they organize for their company. As you can tell, I'm interested in their firm and I've kept close connections with their employees.\n\nIn my first year of my degree, I applied to their company as a Software Developer Intern, but I did not think much of it. I knew that as a first-year student, my chances were minimal. \n\nLast year, I met the recruiter and others through one of the company's events and I managed to make some connections. Few months later, they asked me for an interview. It was a 30 minute talk with the recruiter, so basically getting to know me. After 2 months, I got an automated rejection email. Felt kinda sad, but I decided to move forward and keep improving.\n\nNow it's winter 2021 and I've completed a similar internship position somewhere else. So early in January, I saw the recruiter again at a virtual talk, where they were recruiting interns and they saw me too. After the event, they encouraged me to apply again for intern positions and would let me know when new ones are announced.\n\nFast-forward two months later, and I get another rejection email without being called for an interview this time. Now as you see, it's been 3 times since I've been rejected as an intern and it may be obvious that I either lack the skill or I do not fit with the company's culture.\n\nMakes me sad because I always wanted to work there. I have several friends who are interning for that company X...for the second, or even third time in a row!\n\nWhat can I do at this point? Is it a bad idea to apply again for the fourth time, even for a full-time position? What are areas I need to work on? Should I ask the recruiter for feedback? Should I give up?\n\nLong post, but I guess it's best to ask for advice, rather than stay silent.",

        "body": "Hi all - I'm a product manager working on fairly technical software products that's interested in getting a deeper foundation in computer science to really understand the technology that I'm working on. My day to day role is focused more on developing requirements and meeting with customers, so I don't have much opportunity to really dive deep into the technology on the job.\n\nAlthough learning more CS will help somewhat in my role as a product manager, the real reason for the fundamentals is so I can gain a deeper understanding of the software that's now eating the world and can get a clearer picture of where the world is going. I have a pure intellectual interest in the subject and just want to be able to analyze what software companies are doing at a deeper level. However, I know that professionally I am much stronger on the business side than as a developer, so I'd like to continue working in business-focused roles in technology and have no aspirations of going into development full-time. I like working on toy problems and coding challenges, but large-scale programming of production systems is another beast that's best left to people that are more talented programmers than I am.\n\nWhat have I done so far? I've got an educational background in mechanical engineering, I've taken a 6 month part-time webdev bootcamp online, I've taken Andrew Ng's machine learning course, as well as a few other courses focused on AI. \n\nBut I still crave to know more, so much so that I'm actually considering entering into a masters in CS - I just don't have the time to do courses part-time these days. But people tell me that it would be crazy to do this if I don't intend on working as an engineer post-degree. At this point, it's not about economic ROI for me, it's about becoming the most impactful person I can be and deeply understanding the products that I manage and will help create in the future. I realize I don't technically need to know CS fundamentals to work as a product manager and lead software companies, but I just don't like stuff being a black box.\n\nMy current plan is to actually take some time off work and take some targeted courses to learn on my own. Nand2Tetris is one on my list that I'm hoping will give me some of the foundational knowledge I'm looking for. Any other ideas or course recommendations? Anyone on a similar journey? Anyone else gotten a CS masters with no intention of going into software development full-time?",

(12.5%) This alone makes the counter offer >$10k more valuable than the new employer's offer\n* Team lead software engineer with direct reports\n* Medium sized non-profit\n* \\~30 vacation days + large amount of separate sick days\n* Probably more work overall, and probably more than 40 hours per week for a while though it should improve\n* Older tech stack and lots of technical debt but potential for improvement in the future  \n\n\n  \nI've been waiting on a promised raise and promotion at my current company for over a year now.  It was put on hold due to COVID.  When someone reached out to me with an incredible opportunity, I had to accept it since it seemed like the wait could drag on for months.  I've also been overworked and understaffed, putting in extra hours, but we are working on hiring some new developers for my team to help out.  \n\n\nMy current employer counter offered when I told them about the offer, but it was far lower than the external offer, so it was an easy decision to quit.  When I told them my decision to accept the external offer, some of my colleagues who value me, including director level positions, reached out to management to voice their concerns about my departure.  They apparently made our executives reconsider, and I was given a second much better counter offer.   \n\n\nI know that most people say not to accept counter offers, but I do tend to trust that the IT directors aren't looking to replace me or fire me.  They just really want me to stay.  The fact that they're able to provide this raise now, however, suggests that they also could have given me my raise and promotion a year ago if they really wanted to.    \n\n\nWhich offer should I choose?  The counter offer is substantially more valuable overall due to the extra vacation and large 401k match.  I do suspect I'll be working harder and longer at my current employer, however, but that may improve in the future.  Thanks for any advice.",

Could agreements go awry after this stage. If they can't my initial response would be to cancel on other interviews to save everyone the time. What do you say?\n\nI massively appreciate any/all inputs! Thanks a bunch and stay safe :)",

        "body": "Hello, I have some questions about webdev bootcamps. \n\nFor backstory, I'm 33, have been working in low voltage network wiring for 10 years after finishing an associate's philosophy degree (realized I didn't want to be an adjunct...), and am looking to shift careers. I'm just south of the bay area in Santa Cruz, and am very attached to staying here. I've recently begun learning how to use game maker studio 2.\n\nI've been looking into web dev bootcamps, and am curious about how viable they are in terms of job prospects in the bay area once you are finished. As mentioned above, I'm new to coding but am wanting to build a portfolio and study in my own time as well. \n\nDo bay area businesses *actually* hire inexperienced web devs that have finished a boot camp and don't have a bachelor's degree? And if so, which boot camps are more reputable in this regard? If the bay area job market is too competitive or difficult, is remote work a viable option post boot camp? (As mentioned, I'm unwilling to leave the area for a job).\n\nAt 33, I'm hesitant to return to school for a 4 year CS degree and start my career at 37 or 38. It's a tough choice. Any help and guidance in this regard would be greatly appreciated, particularly as it applies to a bay area context.",

        "title": "Let go from a position after 2 months of work. Was I the problem?",
        "body": "So a little background.\n\nI've worked for two companies over the past 1.5 years since graduating college. From my first position, I had furloughed from COVID19 but was working as a Java/Full-Stack dev. This job was over the course of about 7 months before my furlough. I got an offer to get training for an Appian position with 10 weeks of training, so I decided to take the offer. Eventually, that position had to lay me off at the end of 2020 due to budget changes in the contract.\n\nFast forward to Jan this year, I got hired for another contract to work as an Appian backend dev with testing. This was a Junion position. I've been let go at the end of March due to performance. I didn't have any prior mentions of issues from my team lead or co-workers about this, and to be honest the general environment around there seemed tense as we were due to ship the project by April 2021.\n\nI think that perhaps the biggest issue was the fact that because I was new I needed to learn the project, which was very dense at this point being near the end of development. But because senior devs were so busy with the project, along with my team lead, I rarely got mentoring or feedback on my work.\n\n\\-I always made it a priority to communicate my goals every sprint, to reach out if I got stuck somewhere in the project as I didn't want to idle.\n\n\\-I contributed my own ideas in team meetings about how to go about implementing solutions to problems. Some of my ideas got integrated into the project.\n\n\\-Checking to make sure I was working efficiently and not going off and doing work that wasn't critical like refactoring or bug fixing.\n\nI did make mistakes due to me being new, most of them coming from the fact that I was learning both how the project was integrated and doing development. Things like having to correct documentation, correct test cases, or getting feedback on pseudocode I wrote didn't get sent to prod (It never did, we had multiple levels of peer review to make sure such a thing didn't happen). Sometimes I needed to have mentoring because I could get 75% of the work off the ground with the amount of knowledge I had.\n\nThe biggest thing that got to me was every story that was assigned to me was completed by the deadline. I never had it rollover. I pushed myself to work overtime on weekends to get stuff done. Although my senior co-worker told me he was concerned about the project if juniors were having to do that. I know for a fact I wasn't the fastest developer, but I wasn't the slowest either. As a team, a trend was that almost every user story was getting done only 1-2 days before the deadline.\n\nIn the end, I was working on bug fixes and documenting the changes made to the codebase when I was pulled into the office, told I had issues with my performance and was out of a job. My best guess was due to the fact that I wasn't pushed out stories fast enough or taking on enough. Which I don't understand as I asked my team lead to give me more work if it was needed. One specific case was me offering to do 10 points for a sprint and being told to do 5 because they didn't want me to get overwhelmed. I tried to argue that every story I did was always meeting deadlines and I was confident in my work but in the end, I was placed where I was by my team lead who I loved working with.\n\nIn the end, I was pulled into the office after I had been there for close to 3 months. I was told I was being let go due to performance. I had never received any warnings on it from anyone. Nothing was documented or provided to me in that meetings. I didn't want to argue with them as burning bridges was a risk in my mind.\n\nI am looking for work with interviews coming up next week for junior dev roles, but this stuff scares the shit out of me. Did I fail them, did they fail me, or was it a combination of both? I do plan to use the experience in a resume because I did learn quite a bit about myself in how I handle pressure and deliver results, so I'm prepared to explain it in an interview. ",

        "body": "I'm at a confusing point in my life, I'll try my best to keep things short.\n\nIn my final year of college, I was recruited by a Japanese firm for a very competitive salary. Then the pandemic happened and I wasn't able to go to Japan as per my joining date (late 2020). The company that hired me is a product-based one that uses only PHP as its primary language without any frameworks (LAMP). My company is quite reluctant to give me remote work and wants me to join the team on-site once I am able to come to Japan, hence I've been unemployed for a fair share of 6 months or so. Hence I've been stuck in this constant limbo of waiting for Japan to open its borders and get to work there. So, I have been thinking of alternatives, to apply for other jobs to have some financial stability mainly overseas because the pay is too low for new grads in my country. But, I have spent the last year learning PHP and brushing up on it because Java was my go-to language the past years and have forgone any kind of interview prep all soever. Tbh, I consider myself average when it comes to problem-solving and the thought of giving interviews and going through those coding rounds gives me nightmares. So here are my primary questions:\n\n* Should I start preparing for giving interviews in the coming few months?\n\n>That would basically mean forgoing hope of making it to Japan by all means and making *Cracking the coding interview* my bible and going through it for 5-6 hours a day whilst practicing problem-solving online (Leetcode). This would also mean I'd have to let go of PHP entirely as it personally prefer Java over it and spend a few weeks in the end building up to date Java projects (1-2) for my resume. I would need atleast 3-4 months to be interview ready at the state I am currently.\n\nOR\n\n* Should I wait and prep for the job I already have secured?\n\n>I already had put in a lot of work, sleepless nights studying DSA and have gone though that whole interview process to secure that kick-ass job in 2019. Should I just give up on it because the borders aren't likely to open till late October 2021? Or should I just wait patiently and practice PHP as much as I can, while building a few personal projects and learning a framework (Laravel) and make sure I am a valuable asset to the company I will be joining.   \n>  \n>This would eliminate all the peer pressure of applying for jobs and giving interviews but the only problem is I have no clue when I will be flying to Japan and my career would actually start and I would see that email/sms of my first paycheck deposited into my account.\n\nSo here I am, a junior developer who hasn't even started his tech career yet in a dilemma now, any sort of advice from experienced veterans would be helpful.\n\n*This post came out longer than I anticipated, my apologies.*",

        "body": "What I want to understand is how doing online courses in OOP and data structures and algorithms is conducive to being a better programmer. I get the intuition behind it (I mean, you can only be such a great writer if you don\u2019t nail your grammar/sentence mechanics) but I don\u2019t think my hours studying DSA has ever come in handy in my working experience as a SWE (other than Big O, which I still use to evaluate my code + when optimizing my code).\n\nWhen I asked my manager for clarification on what he meant by brushing up on OOP/DSA fundamentals, he said that it would be useful for debugging (which, I don\u2019t doubt, but wouldn\u2019t more experience with the framework at hand be more beneficial for debugging?), I should have picked up on \u2018big picture ideas\u2019 in Django as opposed to looking up the documentation for every small minute detail (e.g. for those familiar with Django, he suggested that I should have just done something like\n\n    for order in Orders.Object.filter():      \n        time = object.created_time  \n\ninstead of using\n\n    queryset = Orders.objects.filter().value_list('created_time') \n\neach time in a different function) which\u2026 I also get, but I\u2019m also an unexperienced programmer picking up four new technologies in a month - of course my code isn\u2019t going to be perfect/ production ready. I also gave precedence to timeliness over code quality because who gives a rat's ass about quality code when it couldn't meet the deadline.\n\nI believe there\u2019s a lot of truth to what my manager's saying and I do want to work well with him - just that perhaps there\u2019s something in what he\u2019s said that isn\u2019t clicking for me. Would really appreciate other perspectives + advice on how I can leverage OOP/DSA to accelerate my learning in SWE!\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nBackstory for those interested:\n\nI\u2019ve just finished my first month as a full-time software engineer at a startup of \\~30 people where I\u2019ve been doing primarily backend and data viz work. What this means on a day-to-day basis: learning Django, SQL, Charts.js, and GCP (all from scratch) to preprocess and visualize about 1 million lines of data in real time. This was a project that was given to me to familiarise myself with Django and related technologies before proceeding to writing company code on the production server.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m a December 2020 uni grad where I studied something completely unrelated to CS (political science and psychology). I\u2019ve been dabbling in software since my 3rd year of uni where I completed two uni courses in CS (specifically, CS 101 and an intro to data science course), but am very much self-taught otherwise. I just had my first one-on-one with my manager today, which boiled down to things that I kind of already knew but are still hard to swallow pills -\n\n* He can\u2019t quite gauge my potential as a software engineer + is not entirely comfortable with me writing production code this soon because my fundamentals in (primarily OOP and data structures and algorithms) aren\u2019t quite up to par.\n* He\u2019d be open to me being a PM as my primary role, and software as a secondary role (he\u2019s very open + told me to take initiative to do whatever\u2019s good for the company, which is a double edged sword, but it looks like I\u2019ll still have opportunities to write code at work as I suggested taking ownership of the company website and he agreed... which is ?????? but we'll see). If software is still something I\u2019m deadset on doing (which I am) he\u2019d be willing to reconsider my ability to write production code in 6 months.\n\nThere are a few things that irked me a little about this conversation, namely:\n\n1. the fact that three managers (two technical co-founders + 1 tech lead) hired me knowing that I\u2019d need more support + time picking up new technologies (in their own words) but are now backing out\n2. he\u2019s giving me smaller subtasks to do when he doesn\u2019t have the time to do code review/one-on-one (e.g. add xyz to your dashboard!), but also tells me that I spent 4 weeks doing something that a seasoned SWE could\u2019ve done in 2-3 weeks. (Context: my manager is a start-up co-founder, so I\u2019ve been working quite independently this entire time.)\n3. he keeps comparing me to my colleague, who is an unfair comparison because he\u2019s been a Django developer for 3-4 years - whereas this is my first ever Django project, at my first full-time SWE job. My manager acknowledges that my colleague is an unfair comparison, but it almost feels like my colleague is the benchmark for my performance.\n\nSoftware is something I\u2019d really like to get good at. While I get where he's coming from perspective, I don\u2019t think he fully understands the fact that I did this project not knowing what he was looking for, or the fact that I \\*know\\* my code isn\u2019t optimized or production ready. I\u2019m grateful that I\u2019m not being fired on the spot and I\u2019m trying not to take any of this personally, but I\u2019m a little shocked at how quickly I\u2019m being taken out of a software role. I just want to understand how his advice can be carried out, and how it will work in practise.",

        "title": "Failed senior design, but I can still graduate with a BA. Should I do the extra year for a BS?",
        "body": "Long story short, I was due to graduate in May with a BS in Computer Science. But our senior design project fell through, and the professor let us know that we were going to fail, meaning I wouldn't graduate this semester. I spoke with my advisor to explore different options, and she told me that I have completed all of the coursework to still graduate this May with a BA in Computer Science instead.  She said I could drop the other 4 computer science classes I was taking alongside Senior Design as they weren't needed for the BA. So I ended up dropping them, so my parent's could get their money back before the drop deadline, as I make a decision. My question is, should I just graduate this May with a BA or should I do the extra year for a BS? If I go for the BS, I would have to do a year long senior design, and 4 computer science classes over the course of a year so 6 classes total. I have about 2 years of programming internship experience, and I'm typing this from my internship right now (I'm hoping they extend me to fulltime, but there's no promises). I've been job searching, with my resume saying that I'm due for a May graduation, but I have not heard much back. Feeling a little demoralized, but I just want to make the correct decision for my future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",

        "body": "Hello all,\n\nI recently started working as a SecOps, jack of all trades programmer for a cloud compliance team at a large financial GSE. My entire team of 8 was unexpectedly laid off a few weeks ago, my supervisor and manager had no idea it was coming and were also laid off.\n\nWhen I was hired for the job, I was given the position as a Senior Associate, usually they require at least 3-5 years of experience for this title, I only had 2 years of experience at the time. The recruiter said they made an exception for me because the manager liked me.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1) How do I bring this up to potential employers? Currently I have been honest and told them that the entire team was laid off because of \"reorganization\", that's what I was told in my exit interview. I feel as though they might think I am lying and I don't want it to seem like I got axed because I was promoted too quickly.\n\n2) Should I still be looking for \"Senior\" level positions, 3+ years of experience minimum? Would another company value the title I had or does it vary too much from company to company for them to put any weight behind it.\n\nThank you in advanced!",

This comp Sci masters is the first time I've finally felt like I'm doing something that I really enjoy, I was inspired to get into it after a doing some online courses in Machine learning during my undergrad. I'm also quite keen to work in healthcare/ai if possible. I'll be graduating in September and both the roles I'm trying to choose between will start immediately after I graduate. \n\nAI research internship pros:\n- Well known company - would look good on cv?\n- NLP based project\n- reason I got into computer science was to learn more about AI, this would definitely help with that!\n- it seems that a lot of roles in AI/ML require a PhD, so I feel nervous to pass up an opportunity to work on an AI project with a large company when i can't currently afford to do a PhD \n\nAI research internship cons:\n- offices in the middle of nowhere so I'd have to relocate to a village where I don't know anyone\n- salary is not great as its an internship\n- job ends after 12 months\n\nTech consultancy grad scheme pros:\n- good pay\n- Central London offices\n- been offered a role in health care and life sciences department so there will be a good range of interesting projects\n- rotational schemes in cloud, cyber and software dev so I'd learn a lot\n\nTech consultancy grad scheme cons:\n- company reputation not as good\n- not sure it would look as good on my cv as the company isn't as well known and isn't a major tech company\n- graduate scheme so will likely be asked to do a lot of the ground work for senior consultants which could be boring?\n- not much potential to learn about AI/ML\n\n\nMy main question is, if you were me which would you take? Which role would provide better prospects for me in the future? I've only been doing cs for less than a year so I know I need a lot more experience, but I would absolutely love to work for a health care or med tech company like deep mind at some point in the distant future, so any advice would be much appreciated!",

        "body": "So as the title implies, I am currently considering taking a bachelors of math. Ideally, I would go for CS at the University of Waterloo however, I can't really guarantee I'll be accepted and I think math might be my next best option. Why Waterloo though? Mostly because it provides great co-op opportunities and despite being in Canada, has considerable standing with US companies.\n\nUltimately, I would like to pursue a job in SWE and work in America, even if for a few years, but I was wondering, how feasible is this for a math major? I do have some other universities I could go to for CS including Western, McMaster (well, not yet) and Guelph but do you think it'd be better to just go to Waterloo math because of the reputation/co-op program? By the way, acceptances for this school won't come out till May, but I'm just preparing myself to make the best choice if my situation is not ideal.\n\nSorry if my post sounds a bit naive, I'm not entirely familiar with the SWE industry.",

But he suggested I should also look into other fields as in 5 to 10 years this field might not exist. Previously I thought it was one of the fastest growing fields in the world and it's what I heard almost every day from everyone. I also looked up these concerns online and there's nothing concrete on whether it's actually dying or not. Some say it highly depends on the skill level which is obviously true, and some say it is crazy to think of it dying so soon.\n\nShould I look into something else for my master's so as not to end up jobless in 10 years? Or was he just giving me ill-informed advice? I'm at real crossroads here as I wouldn't have much time to prepare on an entirely new field after this sem.",

I got my first internship in january, and got exposed to a lot of stuff(version control, docker, quality assurance, etc) and for the most part, I did pretty well. I gained confidence and motivation way beyond what I had felt trough college. But then, recently, we were sent to work from home due to a increase in covid cases where I live, and things just started getting worse for me. Inicially we were given the task of studying html, css and javascript, to then take on React, and Rest. I'm still fairly new to these technologies, and we were given 1-2 weeks to learn, build and deploy an app using these technologies. If I was able to dedicate myself 100% to this, I'm sure I would be able to do it, but the problem is that I have a ton of assignments and tests to study for, and even using my free time on the weekends to try and catch up, I still feel quite anxious. Next week I should be getting a little break from college assignments and tests, but the thing I wanna ask is: what is the most efficient way of approaching this?  I feel really anxious, and fear that I may be way behind the other interns, so much that I feel a bit demotivated. Do you have any tips on the best/most efficient way of learning React? Sorry if this by any means got confusing(english is not my first language).",

IO-bound tasks vs CPU-bound tasks.\n\n* there are some IO bound tasks at work e.g.  miscellaneous emails\n* there are frequent interrupts during certain times windows, e.g. a junior dev asks me to debug an error becayse they're stuck, but only during normal work hours.\n* there are some IO-bound housework tasks (e.g. laundry)\n* there are tasks where the cost of context switching is high, e.g. writing code\n* there are tasks where the cost of context switching is low - e.g. answering the phone whilst cleaning my apartment\n* there are tasks that are less fun, or less feasible outside of work hours. E.g. the beach is crowded on weekends. So why not go during the weekday, and work that night? Can't go to the beach at night.\n* I can focus effectively on coding late at night\n\nIt's an interesting optimisation problem. I'm thinking of doing all my housework and life admin each morning, interspersed with meetings. Maybe a beach trip or video games during the day, then work from late afternoon until bed time.\n\nHas anyone tried this? What are the pros and cons? My manager won't mind as long as I attend my meetings, respond to crucial messages in a reasonable time frame, and do approximately the same amount of hours in total. I expect I'll get more done in 3 hours of night time work than 3 hours during the day because of all the interuptions.\n\nI don't want to get to the end of my life and regret just sticking to a default 9-5 hours when I had the opportunity to try a better schedule.",

I decided to go to community college first and I hope to transfer. But I didn't take a single computer science course at all, I just took the core and the electives I need, so I feel like I'm behind. Is it odd to be a sophomore or junior in university in freshman Computer science courses? That's what is most likely gonna happen to me. I'm also worried because I haven't taken a single math course. I understand programming and coding but I failed my community college's basic algebra course and I'm scared to take it. I see calculus II and I know it's a requirement to graduate but it scares me and although I love this career and path, I can't really graduate without it. I understand there are ways to get cs jobs without a bachelor's, but my parents won't see to it. I'm just basically asking for advice from people in the field and what they think I should do. I'm just lost but I really want to pursue a career in this field. I also want to ask how you all got better at practicing and what habits you started to get used to it and how you got to implement coding and programming into your daily lives. Thanks!",

The assessment is centered around C/C++ which I have a lot of experience with, and I've done my fair share of hackerrank/leetcode practice but I've never written a unit test or anything of the sort. I've been looking at testing frameworks and stuff and there's a lot to learn (CLion unit tests, google test, boost, etc), and I'm wondering if I need to learn all that for the assessment because I probably won't be able to learn all that before the assessment (within the next few days). I tried to understand what I was expected to know for the assessment, the only information I got was that I would need to write functions and test them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice on what I can do to prepare?",

        "body": "I've recently lost my job from a place that I believe was fairly toxic anyway, so no hard feelings there. But after working there for two+ years I'm honestly feeling lost in terms of my career at the moment.  \n\n\nI was hired as a .Net developer to work with C#, Azure, agile processes and all of those nice things, when in reality I've probably spent 5% of the time working with C# and the rest in VB6.  \n\n\nWe rarely develop anything new or add new features, so 95% of the time of my employment has been bug fixing in VB6, and these are mainly workarounds to third party software changes. Nothing was collaborative, there was no mentorship, no access to senior devs and I was told that I couldn't ask my co-workers for help either.  \n\n\nFor the last 6 months they've also just moved people around as they see fit to fill out team needs. One day I could be bug fixing, then doing support tickets then testing for weeks.  \n\n\nAs a result I feel like I've stagnated for at least the last 12 months but felt scared to leave during covid. I don't know where I sit in terms of my career, particularly with how to market myself or what roles to look for. I certainly don't feel that I have two years of development from this job so I don't want to lie or embellish my skills to potential employers. I also feel severely lacking in motivation and questioning whether software development is actually for me. I feel that my experiences there may be clouding what a better work environment could be.  \n\n\nIs my tenure going to put people off hiring me for graduate or entry level roles? Am I going to be expected to have far more developed skills than I do? What can I do to bring my skills up to speed, in terms of maybe online certifications, personal projects, something to make me more relevant than my VB6 bug fixes.  \n\n\nAny advice is appreciated and I'm sorry if this is the wrong place for such a question.",

I am coding but due to a need to earn a check, I have been working non-tech jobs. The amount I code fluctuates sometimes going a week or two without coding. At points in my journey, I have had multiple interviews but could not close the deal on any of the positions. These interviews were set up by my Bootcamp but I no longer have access to those services. I have struggled to gain traction otherwise. I am unsure what to do to actualize my dreams to become a developer.\n\nIn my mind, I want to build cool projects to build my portfolio, apply for jobs and reach out to recruiters and employees of places I want to work. The problem with that is I am struggling to actually build viable projects, therefore I don't have the confidence in my work to blindly reach out. I struggle with ideas on things to build and many ideas I have I cannot actually complete.  I come up against many walls and a lack of knowledge. I've felt it was best to strengthen what I know but I'm not sure how far that is getting me. \n\nIf anyone could provide a bit of guidance it would be appreciated. Leaving my job and going to Bootcamp has turned my life upside down and I am not sure how to get it back on track.  \n\nI would love to hear from more experienced developers on what to do and would love if I can connect with some of you.",
