I didn't do well at all and my mentor sensed that and moved me to bug-fixes for their existing line of products (while the other intern continued to work on new product).\n\nc) In the last month, I've been getting better at identifying issues and completing my tasks on time (relatively).

The company is amazing, the people are very friendly and helpful, the product is cutting-edge and exciting to work on.\n\nNow, my dilemma here is that I'm scared that I had a golden opportunity to continue working with them but I blew it by not performing up to the mark. I was struggling with React since day one (have gotten better at it loads since day one but still major room for improvement). I love working here and would absolutely continue with them if they ask me to but I have to be realistic if they decide to part ways.

We had like 200 employees.

Sort of transition to a \u201cworldwide\u201d company. \n\nInitially it sounded interesting and I was happy to be a part of this, but what actually happened was that they put the local market in the background. Meaning they don\u2019t even TRY to hire locally, they just go to Upwork and hire a random developer - and most of these devs simply quit after half a year for a better gig. As a lead I\u2019m now constantly rotating people and we\u2019ve never had a steady couple of months. I can\u2019t build a team to work on the project, and it\u2019s extremely exhausting to do knowledge transfers every other month.\n\nWorst thing about this is that my management doesn\u2019t care.

So for the past 6 years I've been with the same outsourcing company as a full stack developer. I've gained a lot of experience and progressed extremely well. I'm 26, and the most valuable experiences I gained are:\n\n* Team Lead for couple of years - closely monitoring people's progress, mentoring, helping out\n* Software Architect for couple of years - worked with clients to translate their requirements into software. Planned and organized releases, managed client expectations, played around with cool new technologies etc..\n* Interviewed probably around 50 people for the company, mentored around 20 junior developers \n* For the past year, I've been a Lead on a project of \\~40 devs, qas, etc.. I've been managing the \"big picture\" of the project, so things like a roadmap, process improvements, technical improvements, resource allocation etc\n* Had a chance to do project elaborations for 5-6 new clients, so things like requirement gathering, MVP analysis, design...\n\nI've been working mainly in mortgage and real estate and got extremely familiar with how it works in US, even though I'm from a 2nd world country in Europe. I've worked on enterprise applications and with one of the leading names in this domain. \n\nAnd company loves me for it, they can see that I actually **want** to work and are gladly giving me more and more responsibilities. I'm probably earning way more than I should at this point. I'm not bragging but I do think that I do an amazing job and because of it I have a status in the company of 400+. Everybody knows me, everybody trusts me..\n\n*But I'm bored.*\n\nNot sure why, I can't really pinpoint it. The job description is entertaining and I really like the idea, but I'm simply not enjoying it as much as I thought I would. Some of the reasons I can think of right now are:\n\n* No challenge. I've grasped all the ins and outs of the project I'm working on. I haven't had a problem in years which I couldn't solve under 2 hours\n* Monotony and boredom. I know the industry domain, I know the clients, I know the codebase. I'm familiar with *everything.* It's super boring.\n* Company culture. Not related to my project, but I'm starting to dislike company's strategy and culture changes they're making. They started focusing on revenue over quality which I don't think is the route to take at this point\n* Comfort zone. Most of you will see this right away from reading the post, but I **am** in a comfort zone at the moment. That isn't necessarily a bad thing because I have a pretty big salary to fall back on and I don't pour sweat and tears into the work. BUT, it is scary to think of the next 3/4/5 years, where will I be, what will I do etc... \n* No clear future goals. I've hit the peak for what I can do here. Neither company nor my direct managers know where can I go from here, from this position. I've said MANY times I'm way too bored at work and want to take on more responsibilities. The only thing I got offered is to do more project elaborations, which is interesting but not a lot of fun because *I can't work* on these projects - I just do an initial analysis and if clients sign with the company someone else takes over (because I'm stuck on current project).\n\nIn a nutshell, I've no idea where to go from here. My job is nice, I have pretty cool coworkers, a huge salary and both company and my direct clients just *love* me. All of this is nice, but I'm not happy at work. Out of 40 hours per week I can probably say that I enjoy up to 5-10hr. \n\nI understand this is the work I do and not who I am and it's ok to have a boring but a steady and a safe job, but... maybe not at 26?

My cousin believes they replaced me and I should expect a call tomorrow saying so because she said it's not normal and highly unprofessional. \n\nI'm pretty convinced I'll just give it up if they contact me with a schedule because I do find it rude and unprofessional. \n\nHowever, I don't know if this is a good idea. If they give me one tomorrow, should I just tell them thank you but no thanks, or stick it out anyways? Also how would I reject it without sounding unprofessional? I don't want to seem ungrateful or rude because I did have lovely talks with them before this week and they did give me advice for certifications and classes to take.\n\nSorry it's so long.

I started learning programming on my own when I  was in high school, by the time I was about to enter university, I  already had knowledge necessary to start working as a full stack  developer, I gave it a shot and, well after one month I started working  as one, this was basically happening at the same time as university's  first semester. Since then I had been on and off with university, sure I  did not know all these algorithms and stuff back then, but it was  easier for me to learn + I kind of valued my job more.\n\nSince  then its been two years, I am about to finish second year in my  university, but it has been so so bad experience working + studying for  uni. Main reason why is that, I kind of put a lot of effort into my  career, after two years of working, I am already on Middle position and  my project manager, team lead and CTO, all are telling me to take Senior  assessment in the same company, because currently I am technically  already doing Senior's work and they'd like to make it official. Because  of these reasons I am planning to stop my student's status, as I really  can not balance work and university, I also have a passion for game  development and I also have other hobbies (like drawing, hanging out  with friends, etc.).\n\nOne  thing is that before I actually get into game development I want to be  financially stable, and for that I wanted to one day move into big  companies, like Amazon, Google for example.

About 2 years ago I quit a high paying job working in investment banking because I was miserable. I floundered for a few months and, eventually (mostly out of desperation), took a job as a nurse aide at a nursing home. This is just about the dirtiest, lowest paying work available in the healthcare industry. I was unhappy, but pushed on - I needed the money. I picked up a hobby of software development as an escape from the awfulness. When I was coding for fun, I mostly made web apps with React and Express.\n\nOkay, so fast forward a few months into the nursing home job and the nursing home is having crazy problems with suddenly being required to report all kinds of data associated with COVID. I was in the loop on some of these problems and happened to be talking to the NH administrator one day. I pitched him on the idea of automating all of the reporting and told him I could do it quickly and using only open source software. They gave me a shot, and I built a pretty simple automation tool in Python (which I learned as I was building this thing because I'd never used it before). It worked out really well and everyone was impressed. Now I'm there full time trying to \"innovate\" with more software. Whatever that means. \n\nDo I have enough experience to move on to a real developer role at a tech company? I have a bunch of web dev portfolio projects and this one professional experience, but not much else.

Usually all the skills that I learn on the job for the purpose of a deliverable, there I just upskill myself enough to finish my task at hand. I don't really get to learn those skills thoroughly.\n- A new skillset of client consulting which I feel is an important skill to have as you grow in your career or even if I wish to start something of my own someday.\n- Exposure to different use cases/system architecture (though at high level only) when doing consulting for clients from different domains like ecommerce, banking, social media, etc. This will basically increase my breadth of different system designs.\n- I feel this is a right time to explore and experiment with different profiles in the software/technology field for me.

I spend a lot of my free time learning new about the field on my own. I would appreciate your opinion on the following questions:\n\n1) Is it possible for me to be considered for a software engineer role at big tech companies without any degree at all? Do you know people who get a software engineer job there without a degree?\n2) Do I have chances to get an interview with my current experience?\n3) What should I do to become closer to my goal of working at FAANG company? Should I focus on getting more work experience and real-world knowledge in the field or pursue a degree?\n\nThanks!", "created_utc": 1622866734.0}, {"author": "eternally__curious", "title": "People who started of as jack of all trades , how did your career progress?", "body": "***Context***\n\nI have been working for about 6 years as a jack of all trades guy in a small-ish tech company which is also my first job out of college . Over here I have worked on a number of different things like \n\n* Testing : Maintaining and upgrading testing automation based on Java, C, Python, Go  \n*  Webdev : A project where  I singularly  worked on desigining  and implementing both the  front and  back end\n* Devops : managing hosts which have  all tyep of operating systems flavors in local KVM hosts and AWS \n* QA for different products \n* Release management  \n* Benchmark performance measurement and tuning \n\nWorking on all of this has given me the confidence that I can work on almost anything and that I genuinely like problem solving and making things. But the issue is I have  decent breadth experience but not depth .eg: \n\n*  The end to end webdev project that  I worked on used PHP and vanilla JS with jquery which is not something that employers look for.\n*  My AWS experience has been with launching instances through something that I wrote around CLI and not stuff like kubernetes ,etc \n\nAll of this has given me major anxiety while applying for jobs as they seem to be searching for an AWS engineer, web dev engineer , etc \n\n***Questions*** \n\n* What was your experience as a jack of trades guy/gal ? \n* Should I pick something specific like being a cloud engineer or performance engineer and double down it on my free time? \n* Should I just follow the traditonal leetcode , DSA , etc routines and hope that the companies I am applying for don't mind my lack of specialization?", "created_utc": 1622866488.0}, {"author": "Medium-Difficulty-54", "title": "Should I get a second degree in CS?", "body": "So My initial degree was in Math.

I'm willing to do crazy hours if it's that important, but I want to feel like I am going to get something for it, that it isn't just silently being demanded from me for nothing.\n\nMy question: how do other companies handle asking for unusually heavy overtime?

I think I'm pretty good at it but of course I'm not perfect. I've coached a bunch of juniors over this time and helped people ramp up and contribute code very quickly and learn about best practices and such. All that said, I've had several junior and midlevel engineers over this time who have really tested my patience. They've all been different, but usually what connects them is they have some anxiety-driven behavior that really disrupts the workflow of the group and wastes other people's time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne example: I have a perfectly nice coworker who is productive and generally does good work, but he has some anxiety thing going on that drives him to try to help far too much. He often tries to offer input and get involved in many situations where he just doesn't have anything to contribute, even responding on behalf of other developers in their PRs when he doesn't actually know the answer. Usually this results in team members (especially non-technical ones like Product Owners) getting very confused and time being wasted explaining why his comments are wrong and what the actual answer is. Sometimes this manifests in even worse ways, where he interrupts people in meetings to offer information but he's not even talking about the right thing. Reading this over it might sounds like this comes from a toxic know-it-all type person but really he was driven by this compulsive need to help without stopping to think if he was contributing anything useful. I'll admit that many of his comments aren't too impactful and don't waste much time, but it really adds up when he comments on work he isn't involved in multiple times a day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother example: I had a junior developer on my team that was very capable but rushed through everything. I believe he had some anxiety about delivering work quickly and as a result he didn't care about code quality at all. One thing that repeatedly came up with him was that he was in such a rush he didn't bother fully reading and understanding PR comments or even Slack messages before beginning work based on the comments. This would waste everyone's time because we'd have to leave the same PR comments again that he didn't actually address, or repeat the same things over Slack that he didn't read the first 1-4 times. I encountered this with him several times with PR reviews and he eventually confessed to me that he never fully read my PR comments, and once he did he understood them completely. I won't lie, this really frustrated me and I was really starting to lose my patience with this guy. He seemed perfectly content to waste my time asking for repeated explanations when he had no intention of reading them. Fortunately this developer has since moved on from my company so I no longer have to deal with this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm curious about what other leads have encountered and how have you handled it. Usually I'm just very direct with these juniors about what I think they need to improve or stop doing, and I emphasize what the result of their actions is for themselves and for other team members.

I was in that same boat and decided to go for it and wanted to share my experience. Feel free to ask any questions! \n\nBelow is just some context about my journey - definitely not required reading. \n\nMy background\nMy background prior to enrolling in the bootcamp was an undergrad degree in poli-sci and a single intro to CS class in python. Post college I spent a couple years doing code academy classes in python, html, css, and sql (MySQL I think) but honestly I didn\u2019t know what to do with anything I was learning and there were huge gaps in between where I would forget everything I\u2019d learned and have to start over. \n\nI\u2019d considered bootcamp in the past but the price tag ~20k price tag was scary since I had a lot of student debt already and no financial safety net. COVID is what ultimately pushed me into committing though since I was working as a Digital Marketer for a brewery and the lack of job security became too much. \n\n\nDeciding on a program\nI did so much research but still found it very difficult to decide on a program since prior to being a SWE or full stack developer it\u2019s hard to understand what each program is trying to do. Obviously this is different for everyone but for me the most important factors were a JavaScript stack, scholarship options or tuition deferment until after graduation and reputation/competitiveness. \n\nAlso don\u2019t let the reviews fool you - like many places bootcamps are great at flooding their reviews with 5 star ratings and hiding the negative ones. In fact after I started my program I went back to the reviews and really started digging. That\u2019s when I found that all of the negative reviews were about 20 pages deep, much further than I would have ever ventured. I would honestly trust alumni for honest answers far more than reviews. \n\nThe program\nDon\u2019t be fooled. The programs will claim to get you from 0 to SWE in 3 months. Expect a 6 - 12 months minimum. The program I attended had. 4-6 week prep followed by a month long precourse program after you are accepted followed by the 13 week program duration where they flat out state that job search is typically a 3 - 6 month process. I only had about 5 months of savings when I started so I barely made it work.\n\nAs far as difficulty and stress it\u2019s honestly what you\u2019d expect. 60 hour work weeks, 6 days per week and the amount of time you can put in outside of class time is very dependent. For me the hardest part wasn\u2019t the material itself but the isolation from friends and family since you have very little free time, are usually exhausted at the end of the day and are going through something that they probably won\u2019t understand. Be sure you set the right expectations with people since the program will truly demand almost 100% of you. \n\nJob Search \nA good program will have a solid job search department. I found the resources they provided very helpful and I structured my search by splitting my efforts into outreach (with people in my network and just random alum on LinkedIn) and cold applications. This might be a cardinal sin to say here but I honestly gave up doing leetcode and algorithms about 3 weeks into job searching. Despite all my practice none of the information ever sank in and I always did poorly on algo coding challenges. It felt like so much work for the off chance that I would get a problem I\u2019d already done and since other places were offering me application based challenges I decided I\u2019d rather just work for a place that didn\u2019t judge the quality of their developers solely on algorithm knowledge. \n\nThe most effective tool to getting interviews for me was random recruiters on LinkedIn. Some were obvious scams or under the line of legitimacy, but a solid 60% were legit and led to interviews (and eventually 2 offers). I noticed a lot of recruiters who were contacting me for senior level positions and I don\u2019t know how common that is but I always responded that given my current experience I thought I\u2019d be a better fit for junior - mid level roles and that usually still got me in the door for more appropriate positions. \n\nOffers\nI ultimately ended up with 3 offers on the same day. These were for Boston based companies with base salary ranging from 80-85k with comp ranging from 15-25k. I had to do some real soul searching about which company to choose but decided that my ultimate goal was to have a good work/life balance and chose the place I felt would best give me that. \n\nStarted: Dec 2020\nFinished: June 2021", "created_utc": 1622827007.0}, {"author": "FirelessLore12", "title": "Transitioning from front-end developer intern to back-end developer intern", "body": "Just a quick question, what is the difficulty curve of back-end related developer jobs dealing with stuff like golang, nodejs, cloud architecture management, devops, etc compared to front-end developer jobs?

I'm more focused on how employable taking each job would make me and how much I would enjoy living at each location (making friends, etc). I should probably say this on a throw-away account but I'm also worried if I'll be able to do the job... I had an internship at a big tech company but didn't get a return offer, so maybe I should take the easier one to be safe??\n\nAny advice or thoughts would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks.\n\nAlso, these offers are without negotiation... should I?

My issue is that I don\u2019t know how I stack up because I work with other scientists who\u2019ve learned to program. \n\nI have worked on public repos and have experience working in an agile environment.

I chose computer science cause I liked math and logical thinking, but in came data structures and design algorithms in my second year and I started losing my footing. I get the point of these courses, but I was so bad at them and was lost most of the time, so I just associate them with dread. The courses that I do like revolve around Data Science, obtaining insights, experimenting, that kind of stuff. I don't really enjoy Machine Intelligence but that could be because when I took that course, the online mode of classes sucked (and it needs me to understand algorithms **\ud83d\ude10**).  I'm currently doing a course on Computer Network Security and Information Security but I don't have any feelings about that. \n\nThese two months were reserved for internships, but I wasn't able to get any. I find the technical coding tests really hard. And I haven't landed a single interview. My CGPA is an 8.5 and I've worked on projects almost every semester, and most of the time I'd be using libraries and stuff that already exist. I'm not writing my own algorithms anytime soon. \n\nI'm just going to put down a list of stuff that's worrying me: \n\n\\- I really need a job. I don't even know if I'd like it, but at least it would pay, and if I could stick with it for a few years I might have other ideas down the line and do something I actually enjoy. Which leads me to my next point: \n\n\\- I need my resume to look good but that's so not the case. All I have on my resume right now are projects that I've done. And I don't even feel like they're any good. I haven't done any volunteering cause. Let's just say I wasn't having a great time at college, so stuff like organizing events was way out of my train. But I could feel it every single minute I wasn't doing this stuff. I don't know I wasn't in a very good headspace.\n\n\\- I feel like a lot of the stuff I know is meager and I'm not very well informed. I'm doubting my skills because of how I've performed in these technical rounds for internships (so many of them deal with data structures and algorithms and I immediately feel a dread) (I'll be honest I only started actually practicing solving coding questions like recently on leetcode but still, if I'm not even into that stuff, why do I even need to be tested for it D;)\n\n\\- I feel so burnt out and I have no motivation to even work on my remaining courses. I'm currently doing a project with a teacher and I'm sucking at it. I think I actually need to sit down and understand the nitty gritty details of an algorithm but I'm not able to concentrate at it cause lockdown again isn't helping. Nothing's been fun. And this ever looming feeling of disappointment won't go away. \n\nLike I understand algorithms and data structures are important. I've felt their need while doing projects. But I for the life of me can't get myself to sit down with them. I've been such a good student, but the past two semesters have sucked and I'm so scared about my exam, and this big project and not being able to score an internship. \n\nSo I want to know if I can ever land a job with my current progress? What additional work do I need to put in? How can I even look for jobs that I love if I'm not even able to get past a technical coding round? How did y'all get anything done?

I've talked to numerous people in these fields, and have a good idea of what to expect.  Both jobs seem to be suitable fits for me.  I'm a problem solver and I love \"fixing\" things, hence SW dev.  I also love meeting/helping people and closing deals, hence RE Agent.  Money is not at all the bottom line for me.  I refuse to shamelessly promote myself if I go into Real Estate.

I've worked at non-tech but extremely large and prestigious institutions development. I have had a non-eventful and content career. I have never worked longer than 44 hours a week, I have never felt underpaid or unhappy about my choice in profession. I think a lot of it has to do with the luck of having a good team but I also think a part of it has to do with some of the stuff I've applied during my career.\n\n**Lessons Learned**\n\n* **Big-N isn't everything,** the amount of time you spend grinding out leetcode *just* to grind it out 16 hours a day at amazon isn't worth the opportunity cost of living your life and stumbling on better opportunities/happiness. My TC has been around the low six figure mark but I spend most of my time and brainpower outside of work doing stuff I enjoy. I use my normal job to pay my tax bill every year.\n* **WLB and TC are not mutually exclusive**\n   * There are plenty of \"unknown\" companies with amazing WLB and pay, the best thing to do is to set boundaries. Tell your hiring-manager your priorities, its good for them and good for you.\n* **Never say no to learning a new skillset.**\n   * I was initially hired on as a java developer but was sent to do PEGA instead, which is basically a nicer salesforce. Halfway through, I was asked to run as a support engineer for a few months, manage an actual salesforce application and then eventually back to Java.\n   * It keeps you valuable, flexible and makes your job less dull. I see a lot of people complain about \"I wasn't hired to do x\", that's a terrible attitude to have, your job is to think and learn not write CRUD until retirement, it leads to the next lesson.\n* **Communication skills are key**\n   * One of the most important skill on any **team based environment** is your ability to socialize and communicate. I've been hired and promoted based purely on my communication skills whilst having average talent.\n   * Getting along with your coworker and earning their respect is a very important thing. Unless you work at amazon, they will try and help you in anyway they can, telling my boss/interviewer that I **COLLABORATED** with another coworker for a small side project at work was critical in both my promotion and job offers. In any situation, I will always try to make my coworker look as good as I can.\n   * If you're doing something unfamiliar, risking a deadline or having trouble the best way to move forward is to **tell the truth**.

I can give some examples, but it's best to really read or practice it. Example: I can't get this done on time because I'm unfamiliar with the stack/tool/environment/etc. ---> There's a risk that the current assignment I'm working on won't be finished on time due to being unfamiliar with x/y/z, can I get someone to assist me or point me in the right direction?\n   * Solving leetcode won't leave a strong impression at interviews but being a sociable,\"cool\" guy with a sense of humor and collaborative mindset has always been the #1 deciding factor on how I got my jobs.\n* **Resigning is (almost)always an option.**\n   * If you truly feel dissatisfied your job, team or whatever you can always resign. Resignations **matter** **a lot** to any reputable company. Hiring, onboarding, training costs **a lot** of money. I felt unhappy with decisions made by upper management and found a new job, it gave my other coworkers the courage to make the same decision and now there's a massive retention problem at my old place.\n\nAlso, the amount of FAANG circle jerk on here and blind gets super cringe don't fall into that greedy FAANG or die mindset, it makes you tunnel vision from better financial opportunities.", "created_utc": 1622769786.0}, {"author": "RussianBot2937", "title": "Taking Up a Random Temporary Full-Time Job Until I Find a CS Related Job?", "body": "I just graduated with a BS in Math.

I had to sit in front of 3 people reading my CV and transcript for the first time. They said remarks in a foreign language that I can understand but not speak so I had to pretend I didn't understand anything. They kept asking why I didn't take this and that and why I even bother applying.. even though they said I \"passed the document screening test\" in the interview invitation email.\n\nLong rant, I need to get this off my chest. Going with throwaway account since I don't want my friends to know about all the details. I'm a hypersensitive person by nature, so putting up a though exterior is harder than ever. But I guess I've been mostly lucky in my past job-hunting experience, for recruiters I talked to were generally nice. If I lack something that they're looking for the most in an incoming intern, they'd tell me honestly and I'd always be like, \"cool, let me work on that, and I'll contact you again once I'm ready\".\n\nI'm kind of desperate to find summer internships these days, so I just applied to all companies I could find. Before you say it, yes I know I should've applied to companies that I know I'd be a top candidate in, but several times I've gotten offers from companies I thought wouldn't accept me, because they saw my potential from the many cool (tho unrelated) stuff I did on my CV -- according to them.\n\nA bit of background: my main focus is AI and data science, although I have a little experience with front-end. I'm getting interested in backend lately, since I'm taking several backend-related courses, so I'm trying my luck with backend job openings in startups in case they don't mind accepting newbies (I know it's near impossible, but why shouldn't I give it a shot anyway?).\n\nNow I'd assume that if they invite me for an interview, they'd have at least seen my CV, known the kind of stuff I have and haven't done, and saw the slightest potential in me. I received a notice that I \"passed the document screening process\" and they would like to have me in an offline interview, with dress code: formal clothes. I asked what kind of stuff I need to prepare for the interview and they didn't reply. Cool, maybe they wanted to keep it a secret\n\nSo I came, but the first greeting I heard was that they somehow lost my CV and I needed to send them a copy again. Obviously I got confused but I did anyway, and I had to sit down in a small table facing 3 guys who are reviewing my CV while pointing out things on my CV and transcript and making remarks in a foreign language (I'm an international student). It's a very awkward situation since I'm not fluent enough to talk in their language, but I know just enough to understand what they're talking about. So they'd say things like \"that girl did this..\", \"she didn't do this at all.. wut?\" etc etc, and I just had to pretend I didn't hear anything while still keeping my cool to answer their obviously impromptu questions. And one guy would translate my English interview answers to their language, since the other guys aren't that fluent in English, so I painfully need to hear my paraphrased answers throughout the interview.\n\nNear the end, some leader-looking guy came, he saw my CV for a few seconds, and asked why I haven't taken this course and that, and how I haven't taken so many required courses (but I'm in year 3 and I only need 2 more courses). He then asked questions that I didn't know the answer to, and when I tried to answer he would make obvious \"ehh what?\" faces and told me why I even applied if I hadn't took this and that. It was getting harder to maintain a straight face, so I went blabbering about how I'm used to study materials on my own, that there are countless free resources, and that I believe I could study on the way given enough time etc etc.\n\nI mean I get that those stuff are important, but if it's such a problem that I haven't taken those classes, why not reject me from the first place? I've stumbled upon this kind of situation before and the recruiter would just straight up tell me to study this and that first before re-applying, instead of painfully dragging the \"why did you even apply?\" question for hours.\n\nThe offline situation made it even awkward. After making all those mean remarks the \"leader\" casually asked me how was the interview, and I just said it was kind of not what I was expecting. I didn't have time to eat before the interview, it was raining, and their office was sooo far from the main entrance. Call me a snowflake or whatever, but I'm still shook and cry when I remembered what happened. Now on top of a bruised ego, I'm losing the interview confidence I had tried so hard to build over the years.\n\nI know I have to own it etc etc and I'm totally fine with them not accepting me for my lack of experience, but can't they do it in a nicer way?", "created_utc": 1622739433.0}, {"author": "Two_tickets_plz", "title": "I wasn\u2019t supposed to be a swe. After 3yrs I feel stuck.", "body": "Hi all. I\u2019m looking for some career advice. I did my bachelor in math and master in analytics. I applied to my current company for a data analyst role but somehow I was assigned to work on Scala/Spark at first and last 2 years I\u2019m mostly doing Java backend. This is not what I was expecting at all but I took the opportunity to challenge myself and managed to survive until now. I was assigned to work on a bigger project this year and now I feel like I\u2019ve really reached my limit and started questioning my career path. I tried to list out things that I love and hate about my experience so far and possible conclusions. \n\nBackground:\n- 3 yoe(Fortune 100). Late 20s. US based.\n\n\nThings I love:\n- Using programming as a tool. I sometimes write Google Sheets script functions to help business teams and that was very rewarding to me.\n- Writing SQL querie\n- Making dashboards and data visualization and thinking about what would be the best way to deliver information to clients \n- Agile Scrum practice. I like how tasks and deadlines are clearly defined\n- API development and thinking about the best input and output format for better UI\n\n\nThings I hate: \n- Constantly stressed about something will break. I\u2019m always terrified about breaking the system by deploying something wrong that I don\u2019t understand. \n- Network, server, resource management, scaling, building end to end architecture just feel like something I can never understand. I always try to memorize stuff to just get by but since I don\u2019t fully understand how they work I fail to implement those skills unless I\u2019m specifically told to use them. \n- Feel guilty about not working/studying after 5pm and on weekends . Everyone is working after 5 and even if I\u2019m not working I know I have to study to survive in this industry. I don\u2019t think I can do this for long term. \n\n\nConclusions:\n- Maybe I\u2019m just burned out/depressed.  There\u2019s been a lot going on in my personal life and I haven\u2019t taken actual vacation since I started working full-time. Nowadays I often think nothing seems to matter anymore and just want to give up cs career. But I also feel like I don\u2019t deserve to be burned out because I don\u2019t contribute as much as other people who are working longer hours. \n\n- Maybe what I\u2019m feeling is normal and I just need to try harder to become a better swe. \n\n- Maybe I should learn front end and become a front end developer since I like visualization. But \nI\u2019m not sure how much frontend dev also need to learn about server, network, devops, etc. \n\n- Maybe I should pursue a different career path that uses programming only as a tool. So far I\u2019ve looked into data analytics and digital marketing (SEO analytics). They look fun but I don\u2019t think I fully understand what the job entails. Plus I\u2019ve been away from analytics for 3 years so maybe it\u2019s too late to go back. \n\n\n\n\nDo you think I love these things only because they are easy and I just need to try harder?

The most recent is one I've been at for a total of five years. Most of the previous jobs average 1-2 years. I've seen a lot in the time I've worked. I've bounced between being an operations / security guy to developer back and forth depending on what I feel like doing at a particular job. I managed a team for about a year, too, and didn't care for that but I was good at it. I was an SRE for the first 2.5 years of this job, and am now a Principal Software Engineer. \n\nAt my most recent (five year job) I recently changed to a new team this past January and I have to say the meetings have been excessive. \n\n* Daily stand up for 30 minutes with 15 people that always goes over in time at 2:30pm. \n   * worth noting that we all work on different stuff and I rarely care about what's going on in this, and they rarely ask questions about what I'm doing.\n* Sprint planning weekly - Wednesdays at 3pm. 1 hour.\n   * Same as above. My work isn't relevant in that they need to be groomed in the context of this meeting.\n* My manager usually throws up 1-2 meetings a week at 12:30p or 1p which drives me insane. My lunch is sacred. I need that hour to myself. \n   * This is usually some \"resolve the week's misunderstanding\" meeting.\n* Two alternating 1 hour meetings every Thursday. One of which has 30+ invitees. \n   * These are related to a project that I don't actively work on, but the service I'm writing will interact with. \n* Status check with product owner at 10am every T/Th on one of the two products I'm working on (writing a service from scratch) - 30 minutes.\n* Weekly sync with the SRE team at 4pm on Thursdays. 1 hour. Usually releases early.\n* Weekly security meeting to update on security of our products across the org. \n* Weekly sync up on yet another product that is critical - usually gets way off topic. 11am on Wednesdays - 1 hour.\n* Manager wants a weekly 1 on 1. 30 minutes, and floats depending on our availability.\n\nThese are the meetings that occur fairly normally and don't include stuff like company-wide meetings I'm expected to go to, external product owners and managers wanting to meet, etc.. I found that  while I enjoy the work at this \"new role\" within the same company - I'd find I was logging on at 6am to get some work done before meeting hell roles in, and starting work again at 9:30pm when my wife goes to bed until about 11p-midnight. Sometimes even 1am. I get good work done late in the evening so this isn't a total loss for me.\n\nAfter a period of my wife getting upset at my work hours, and the actual work day being a complete wash most of the time, I decided to set up some boundaries knowing full well there could be career consequences. I'm not \\*too\\* worried about these as I think I've garnered enough respect at this place over the years.\n\n* Ultimate rule - any meeting with more than 4 people in it is wasting SOMEONE's time. I am declining these immediately now. Footnote is I am requesting that the person convey why I'm needed in the meeting. If I can't find a way to participate - I skip. There are exceptions, but for the most part I rarely come out of large meetings feeling better than I entered them.\n* When we hit a moment where nobody has said anything for a minute, I drop. It's too easy to give people the opportunity to take things way off topic, and go over in time by asking \"so anything else anyone wants to talk about?\" - stick to the meeting agenda. When things veer off, I now leave. There are of course exceptions where I feel it's relevant to me, but 9/10 times it's not.\n* Document, document, document. A common \"meeting invite\" I get, is someone asking me to explain stuff I did to them. **I am now declining meetings labeled as such and requesting the meeting requester read ALL the documentation I have written before pulling me into a meeting.** I've finally decided it's not my job to teach people who don't know how to read documentation. This was a hard one for me. I LOVE being the guy in the know, who has the answers. I just can't afford it anymore form a time perspective. These invites usually come in the form of an email invite, with a subject, and no description. Usually the subject is boilerplate: *\"I heard you are working on <service> and I am interested to learn more about it\"*. They usually don't even attach a zoom meeting and I end up asking them for zoom info. These are usually always the ones who are late to their own meetings too.\n* I declined 3/5 of the stand ups. I go in, say my piece, and leave, since I am not super interested in the non-related projects of my other team members. I cleared this with my manager. She was cool with it.\n* Sprint planning - as I mentioned I'm not super relevant to the sprint I got tagged in. I set up my own sprint planning with the relevant other 3 people. Every two weeks, not every one week. We downsized it to 45 minutes.\n* **Inviting me to a meeting with no agenda - auto decline**. This is how meetings get off topic, unorganized, and unproductive. I actually went to one of our overall team meetings and explained that I'm no longer going to accept invites without an agenda. The news was mostly well received, but some people argued that \"you want to meet but urgently, and don't have time to come up with an agenda.\" - I called BS on this and said that if you can think to have a meeting, you should be able to think of 3-5 bullet points and a summary of what you want to gain from meeting. If you can't do that for me, then I can't provide my time for you. Period.\n* No more having the same meeting twice. This is the big killer for me. I will get invited to a meeting where a useful conversation happens, but then the same meeting gets scheduled with a slightly different permutation of invitees. **Record every useful meeting. I started putting the burden of proof on the meeting requester (for these duplicate meetings) to show me that meeting would be productive, and that all the answers they seek are not within the recording of the previous meeting. I ask that they watch the recording (send them the link of course), and create an agenda out of what** ***they want out of it.*** If they cannot provide an agenda that doesn't completely overlap with the first meeting (see previous point), I refuse to meet. I don't have time to have the same meeting multiple times. The company is not paying me to be a professor. They are paying me to produce revenue through code.\n\nI want to close by saying I'm in a comfortable place in my life. My wife is a surgeon, and we have a nest egg that I can afford to be jobless for a hot minute. I took some risks by shaking things up with respect to meetings at my company. I also have a reputation that precedes this behavior, and I'm not sure a new employee would have been successful in declining everything and putting these hard limits in place. I will say that I feel MUCH better about my days, every day now, then I did when I was in meeting hell. I'm no longer lacking the sleep I was before, or as cranky. I don't bitch about meetings as much, and I'm actually providing quality meaningful code. With the meeting hell there was a necessity to cut corners with the limited time I had available.\n\nPS: Some of this is definitely due to mismanagement. I have yet to find a well managed company in my time though. Every company has had its caveats. I love the company I work for and the people I work with. I am trying to make the situation sustainable for me in the long run. I can't fully recommend someone go into a new company with this mentality, and expect the same result I described. If you are in survival mode and just happy to have a job I strongly recommend not pushing the limits until you can achieve comfort with the idea of possibly not having a job.\n\nThanks for reading.

I was hired to do video tech work on some specialized equipment in house. This was my dream job, my 1st real job in a company with benefits and structure.\n\nHowever, reality set in and I found that I hated the competitive toxic culture in my department. Some of the folks there had been around 6+ years at least. Also the long hours destroyed my mental health. I would get in at 8am and leave at 10pm 6 days a week. \n\nI didn\u2019t have time for a life never mind a girlfriend. After 8 months of that, I realized I couldn\u2019t change it, nor I could bring myself to conform to it, even though I still liked the work and other folks here. \n\nIt was then that I started to learn cs on my own through udemy, books and practice. It turned out that around that time, a small dev team was forming in my company. I took note of that and asked the people involved with it if I could work on part of a project.\n\nFast forward to feb 2020 before the pandemic affected the company, my role in the dev team\nhad greatly increased. I created and maintained software (front end, back end, db, dev ops) in top and low level languages on 10+ services. I\u2019d gained so much experience from getting in on them early on and really ran with it. I know it sounds crazy, but I learned a ton in the year prior. I also genuinely like the other folks on the dev team. They are super generous with their knowledge and are really chill with work life balance.\n\nWhen the pandemic affected the company, they allowed me to move to a different city (5hrs away) in the same state, thus making me full time remote-ish during the pandemic. \n\nThey still have me perform some of the non physical aspects of the tech job. But because of Covid, the tech job has become 90% remote and 10% at the office. I do the tech job pretty well as I am the only one in that dept of 6 people that documents workflows, learns new tools and feed it to the other folks. \n\nOne frustrating part in my view is that they haven\u2019t brought me on entirely as a software dev.  But this is secondary. The worst is that my salary does not reflect the 2 jobs I\u2019m performing as I\u2019m technically and in title still a tech person with extra duties.\n\nI am not experienced to earn a senior dev salary, but I know I can earn a mid level dev salary easily (88k-100k according to google).

Still have a good relationship with my boss and we still stay in touch every so often.\n\nAfter a month(OCTOBER) I found a new job. I was signed up as an Angular dev even though I was honest with them that I have always been a React developer, they said during the hiring process that they also have space for React developers. They also said that they have this \u201cOPENNESS\u201d in which it is easy to talk to managers for requests and stuff. When I started they put us in this new team without any structure. We had one senior FE dev who started the same time as us but he resigned after 2 months and warned us that the new company has shown red flags. I ignored it since I needed the job and we have several avenues for learning. We were always on training and never given any real-world coding tasks. Took advantage of the Pluralsight tutorials for Angular and getAbstract but felt that it might not be enough for development once we start.\n\nBy January, the team was dissolved, they just cut the project short. I asked my lead if he can put me in a project for React since they sent an email blast that they were hiring developers for React. He told me that Angular was the direction of the company as a whole. So I said okay, even though the React community is more active than Angular in our channels. I was put in mobile development even though I signed up for web development.\n\nMy first task was to do cleanup of the existing code and to provide missing code coverage. I was not given proper Knowledge Transfer about what the app does or what the specific modules do. They just let me do unit tests for them. We accomplished the task (mostly me, I was a mid dev) but it was stressful since none of the feature owners took some time to help even though we requested for it.\n\nAfter 2 weeks they had issues with the tests again because they fixed some bugs causing the unit tests to break. This baffles me, and they assigned the tests to me again, without letting me know the changes they made. The codebase is usually 1500 lines long per component. It is hard to read and to debug. We also have 8 modules/repositories in this project that are interrelated. Most tests when I was doing them doesn\u2019t have any assertions on them. I relayed this to the team but they made me feel like I was a villain. Mind you, these are senior devs. \n\nThe new iteration is now starting and our Manager told us beforehand to step up and take tasks. So I did, I felt like I could learn more in it. The epic is separated into different tasks and they gave me the last part of the task which is the integration. I quickly finished with the page but was waiting until Monday for the other components(the deadline is Monday too). I told the Scrum Master that I still have dependencies on other devs and basically was just given a day to develop. They had error testing that same day as well. Everything was going wrong so I told him that I have programmed it but I cannot test it since we were on mobile and we needed to sign in through Azure. They had the endpoints down that day. I told him(SM) that I won\u2019t be able to submit a PR, but he convinced me to at least have an initial check. So I did submit a PR. The senior devs did a code review and merged it immediately. I had many bugs filed but I closed them all and we were able to present.\n\nThat was so stressful to me and had my skin broke out in rashes, I had to take a day off work after the sprint and check with my dermatologist. She told me that it was due to stress. The rashes has happened before but that was when something bad happened to my love one.\n\nThey told me I did a good job and thought \u201cokay\u201d. The Delivery Manager even gave me a commendation. A few weeks after he is asking for a report to explain why the bugs were filed. I was confused because I messaged him and reported to him what has been happening, that we need more time for integration work. This has also been relayed to the SM. It felt like I was being burned at the stake, when we were asked to report why there are many bugs.\n\nI went to my dentist after this because my braces got loose and she asked if I was stressed. I said yes, I seem to be clenching my jaw during sleep which has never happened to me before.\n\nNow, I am so afraid of making mistakes and am having panic attacks. I can\u2019t seem to love what I am doing anymore. I feel really depressed that even though I am not that good as a developer at least I love what I am doing and is hard-working. But it seems that it has taken the joy out of me.\n\nI feel incompetent and feel like it is just not a good fit for me, I talked to my lead about this and he calmed me down. He told me that I should not be blamed solely for this and that this is a team effort.\n\nI can\u2019t go to work because I am overwhelmed with how everything is. I am thinking of taking a break to talk to a psychiatrist and get treatment. I also have personal stuff that I have going on. But I need money since I am the breadwinner in my family.

For context, I've worked for multiple other companies ranging from large consulting firms to small startups, primarily as a full-stack dev but also as a dedicated frontend resource. Before my current position, I was a Senior Software Engineer working with an architecture team on developing a new app for a decent-sized company, I left that previous position because of management pushing for faster crappier code just so they could get something out the door faster to sell.\n\n## Problem\nThis new position (which I've been at for about 2 months) is a Software Developer position working for a startup whose values I align with and are working on a cool product. I was offered this position even though I'm not familiar with the specific technologies, but with similar ones (i.e. I know React, they use Vue). The problem I'm having though is my time on the development team has been unpleasant. The manager has never managed before (under a year experience total as manager), I'm the first new hire he has brought onto the team and I feel the expectations are a bit off. Here are some of the oddities I've run into:\n\n-  Was questioned about why I'm ramping up so slowly 2 weeks into the job while the first 4 days were all HR meetings.\n- Extensive Pair programming demands, 4-6 hours a day, brief 15 minutes breaks occasionally. (This stopped after the end of week 3 after both I and the other developer were burnt out of being on video that much)\n- I was outright told that they had thought I was more competent in these technologies even though I told them outright I did not know them but was willing to learn them..

I do have a question on dealing with very highly missleading story writers who just copy-paste other people writings without actually understanding what is required.\n\nI do know that i do have flaws in understanding stories from all sides of analytical stuff, but mostly i do literally take the fact that any story should be available to be picked up by any dev in the team, i am trying to make all communication publicly under the story, but seems we as a team have no way to control this, story writers add stories in 1-2 days before iteration starts and not from backlog, but completely new ones. As well i look for facts inside the stories to get a complete picture from description to acceptance criteria, going through code.\n\nStory 1 itself looks like this:\n\nDescription:\nDo a database modification x and add a new duplicate record strawberry, launch the tests z, y, p and check if all goes well.\n\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1. Add a banana into test z and use the new strawberry to see if flows works, do verifications\n2. Add a kiwi into the test y and use the new strawberry to see if flow works, do verifications\n3. The new strawberry has to be returned aswell with test p, do verifications\n\nStory 1 description ends.\n\nAnother story: all questions are do the same as previous, which appears to be one of core things missed as it is not the same as previous, another story which is dependent on functionality fully not working as intended.\n\n About story 1:\nSo basically one of the devs who went on vacation knew all the background, the guy who wrote the story - did not, so the AC 3 did not made any sense in how the code works at all. Basically to achieve all 3 acceptance criterias in the story was about rewriting almost full functionality from scratch as database modification x is a core key for functionality.\n\nSo after scratching my head and trying to understand what is required as well as talking with fellow teammates they seemed to be clueless as well.\n\nI took a step forward and asked directly our story writer about the actual business case which they want to handle, he had no information, so i went to more senior one - it appears, that strawberry has to be blue, with one leaf left on top of it. Even with those modifications it seems that acceptance criteria 3 would be a complete nonsence to test which i did not get a confirmation for even from more senior story writer. So i handled this in the way which appeared the best for me:\n\n- I did the initial analysis based on all information given as per user story to match all acceptance criterias.\n- As per User story definition clearly asked if the acceptance criteria 3 has any relavance and what the actual values of strawberry has to be\n- Based on my analysis gave other 7 questions that would get impacted by this type of modification which covers all 3 acceptance criterias and if that is expected\n- Added 2 more alternative solution possibilities to achieve whats required by the story itself on all 3 acceptance criterias with much less effort\n- Pinged the story writers in the chat with the added comments and to respond to them.\n\n\nNo answer for multiple days, iteration ended.\n\nSo i just want to understand what more senior developers would do in this situation? \n\nAs per me myself i just simply got tired of that type of stories being one after another with keywords - the same as functionality c, explain how does it work right now after each question of requirements which dont meet real world or absolutely or are just different from how currently the system works or even a story which even with the best efforts of multiple people cannot be done till deadline(not only mine opinion).

As time went on, I became less and less interested in the subject but since I had made up my mind about it, I continued. Then came the medical exam for universities, I...  couldn't clear the test mostly because I could not manage the stress of the constant delays of exam due to the pandemic but also because I couldn't any of what I was studying interesting\n\nI then took a gap year to think about this stuff since stress management is the most integral part of med school and maybe I was not cut for it. I looked for other options particularly biotech and computer science since I liked tech. Biotech seemed very risky to me due to the lack of jobs in my country and that I have do masters for a decent chance at employment. I looked at CS and started an online course, cs50x, I completed week 0 and 1 but quit at week 2 since I was stuck on the problems and couldn't for the life of me do it. I switched to the Odin project since I heard its more beginner friendly. I started the foundation and completed it till the front end where I had to recreate google homepage(I didn't complete it since I had to prepare for university exam)\n\nI liked researching about this stuff and making a page and I thought I should persue CS. I looked up universities and started preparing for the entrance exam. A lot of people have encouraged me but lately some have discouraged me, saying how saturated the market has become and how in four years(when I graduate) it will be even more difficult to find a job and how for a pre med student who doesn't have a strong grasp on math wouldn't make it far in the industry.

The problem? Im a heavily procrastinator, and a bit desorganized with my work. 90% of the time i leave my work to be finished at the and of the project and my sense of urgency only hits when i get closer to demo my work.

I have tried to apply calendars, to-do lists, white boards, apps, they help for some time but they dont change the way i work.

Sometimes i deliver perfect work, but sometimes i feel like i twist reality a litle bit just to pass this evaluation process, i dont want it to get worse, in fact i want to never do that again.\n\nAnd Jesus Christ here am i taking a freelance project with a couple coleagues and thinking about getting a second job, i think to high of myself.\n\nIm terrible in admiting failure and asking for help, those are things that i have struggled with my whole carreer, but since salaries kept rising i never felt life seeking help, but it is time.\n\nAll this self pitty today is pretty worse for the failure of delivering some stuff on my job, so right now everything in my life feels completely failed, and i know im probably overreacting, but it is what it is, tomorrow i will be better but today i feel like a goof.\n\nShould i search for psicological help or maybe try terapy? I have never taken any meds to improve focus, im really afraid of getting hooked to that kind of stuff and never be able to come back.

And by a lot, I mean he fired our network engineer from being on retainer, fired the IT director, and fired the small team of developers I frequently worked with from the Philippines. \n\nThis left me as pretty much the sole IT person at the company, all unfinished projects were essentially trashed and now my day to day work has now boiled down to developing a new website for the company on Shopify, creating any data reports for our move to a new ERP system, maintaining the servers/data backups/workstations, and any day to day help desk issues. While its truthfully not **too** overwhelming workwise, its definitely a lot of responsibility thrown on my shoulders and I do not find much joy in either web development or basic IT work/upkeep.\n\nI will say before this transition happened they were upfront with me that they wanted me to stay long term(because I was the cheapest probably) and I did agree to it as I need a job and wasn\u2019t exactly sure what I was stepping into. But now I would like to maybe move back home closer to friends/family as I am still living where I attended college and find a job that I do not dread as much.\n\nIf I leave, they will be very unhappy as I am going to essentially cripple the IT side of the company.

The company is in a transition period too just to make the situation worse, so I can\u2019t help but feel like I am really screwing everyone here, but on the other hand its kind of insane what they did, leaning the entire company\u2019s tech side essentially on my shoulders.\n\nWould a month notice be fair? That should be enough to help with the transition to the new ERP system, mostly finish the website, and document my work/train a replacement if they chose to hire one.\n\nTL;DR: Company is going through restructure and essentially chose me to run the entire IT side on my own, firing all my coworkers.

Hence, I interviewed and accepted the positions half a year ago despite having another year of school to go. At the time I thought it was the best offer I could get.\n\nOver the past half year I realized I am actually quite good at programming, and after starting my internship this summer (at a startup) I find that the problems my coworkers are having are things I haven't struggled with since freshman year, and I could do so much more. I finish my work in a couple of hours whereas it takes others several days to debug or figure something out. I'm not saying this to brag, I just genuinely never realized my school must have been preparing me at a much higher level (which makes sense as I go to a very good CS school). I just assumed compared to my classmates I was about average, but in the real world, I think I am very far above average.\n\nI have no problem with the compensation, they are actually paying me quite well for starting. Not Google level salary, but well above average for a starting SWE. I am mostly concerned that I will be the only advanced programmer and having to deal with people who don't know the fundamentals. It really bothers me when I have to remind some of my coworkers right now what a tree is or doubly linked list is. Just the other day, one of my coworkers was tripping up on how to go about making a for loop and my heart just sank. I can't work in an environment like that for long.\n\nNow I don't know anything about defense, but I've heard that you can run into some slackers and the work might not be all that challenging. I do happen to be placed at a very well known company in a very interesting division of the company, but I don't want to deal with coworkers who aren't real programmers. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but I think that's fair.\n\nNext year, I want to apply and interview for other jobs, perhaps Google, Amazon, etc. (as well as non FAANG companies)  just to see if I can get an offer. Thing is, the defense company is paying for my TS clearence (it's expensive) and I've already accepted the offer, so I feel like I would be an absolute garabage human being for cancelling if I were to get an offer elsewhere. I'm not even sure I can back out. Also, I doubt I could ever come back if I decided I actually wanted to work there after all, and other comapnies were not the right fit.\n\nSo what should I do? Is it that bad to rescind my acceptance? Should I just stick it out and give it a chance see what happens for a year at the defense job and then transition to switch if it's not for me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSide note: It's not that I don't like the defense company or the work they do. I actually think it's quite cool. I just can't be working on something that isn't above a freshman year coding level with people who struggle to make for loops.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if this came off as arrogant.

What pre-university course is best for CS, would A-level/Ausmat be fine? And would you reccomend studying overseas or is domestic fine (I'm fine either way)\n4. Would it be possible to get involved in video-game industries through CS or software engineering courses?\n5.

The job used to be decent, but as the coronavirus pandemic started last year, it started to become unbearable. The company A started terminating a lot of coworkers to save costs and squeezing the remaining employees to dramatically increase the workload.\n\nEven with reduced benefits and pay, I was working \\~70 hours, and the boss was expecting me to work till \\~2am and work during the weekends too. Coworkers and the boss were calling me even after midnight. I lost a lot of hair, got a skin disease, and dry eye syndrome (doctor diagnosed).  I tried to use my earned PTO and vacation days, but the boss didn't let me use them.\n\nIn the summer last year, I got burned out, and quitted company A without anything lined up, because I can't use my earned vacation and find some time to interview. I lost motivation and did nothing for 3 months to recover, read books I liked, and did some stock trading.\n\nAfter that, I started applying but barely got any interviews last year probably due to bad economy from the coronavirus. But starting from early this year, I started getting decent number of interviews but ended up getting a contractor job from a temp agency (company B) after \\~4.5 months after the 3 month break.\n\nThe job at company B turned out to be a complete bait-and-switch. The actual job duty was nothing like the one on the job description and nothing like what was discussed during the interview. I was basically refactoring their decades old legacy code, and responding to request tickets to fix their bugs. And the area was completely unrelated to what was on the job description. I clearly told them during the interview that this was not my area. I just sucked up and did what was requested as the economy is so bad.\n\nI got fired at company B after 1.5 month with zero warning for arguing with a condescending coworker after having a dispute about a specific implementation. This guy had been delaying my progress for weeks during the code reviews for all sorts of excuses like variable names, etc. I had the exact same piece of code block as another coworker C. He didn't say any complaint whatsoever to coworker C, but blocked my code with all sorts of excuses with a patronizing tone. I gave in, and gave him whatever he wanted to avoid conflicts. But for that implementation, he completely ignored the physical real-world constraints in the deployment environment, and demanded me to change my code to whatever he wanted. I said his code wouldn't work in the deployment environment due to real-world constraints. I already proved that my code was working just fine with simulation results and graph plots. I have no idea what happened, because the manager didn't really care about me and gave me zero warning whatsoever. But I got terminated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I include this 1.5 month temp agency job experience when applying for another job, or remove it off?\n\nUsually, I would have removed it off, but due to my break after working from company A, if I leave it off, I will have at least around 10-11 months gap, which would look pretty bad.

I\u2019m turning 23 in a month and still feel behind in life and like I\u2019ve wasted so much time. \n\nI love technology, I\u2019ve been tinkering PCs since age 13, during my teenage years I was doing stuff with Linux, breaking things and installing stuff, sooner or later I\u2019ve discovered programming and started writing my first lines of code with Python, later on I\u2019ve approached web development and started creating basic websites and cool stuff. I was exceeding in math and related fields, loved logic games and puzzles.\n\nWhile I was in High School I was basically mentally set to pursue a fruitful career in Computer Science, to go to University and study some Computer Engineering and then start my professional life at some software company, and from that escalate the ladder and probably reach a very well paid developer job.\n\nBut at one point, things changed. I finished High School and didn\u2019t go to University, I totally lost interest in programming, I was barely thinking logically, and I spent a lot of time pursuing other stuff like online hustling, reselling, art, videomaking, etc. So basically my idea was to become a Social Media Manager, or start my own Business, or becoming a videographer, or start a youtube channel, or do a little bit of everything while figuring stuff out. I took one year off working part time jobs and personal projects, and then another, and then another.\n\nFast forward 3 years I did nothing that really matters professionally (and economically) in any of the fields I was interested to, my personal projects failed and I built no real skills/experience either (in fact my personal projects were not even that serious and I was not even trying that hard). I made some money and that kept me thinking that \u201cI was about to do it\u201d, but in reality it was a pathway to nothingness and sooner or later the effects of my decisions materialised, hitting me in the back, revealing who I really was: a young adult with no education, no certificates of sort, no portfolio, no network, no skills, no money and no identity. A little bit of everything. A little bit of nothing.\n\nAt one point I moved to (I was forced to due to life and family problems) Germany, now this is my only home, I\u2019m basically stuck here with no real appeal for the job market, the fact that I don\u2019t speak the language is a giant obstacle in any career path (or life path for that matter). \n\nAfter different months here, lockdown, depression and total lack of willingness to do anything (while seeing my friends graduate and getting stuff done) I really decided to get back to computers and pursue a career in IT/Programming, I got back at programming again since a couple of months, but honestly I can\u2019t really imagine what the path would be since I have different problems related to language/culture/network/?:\n\n* Studying anything at university level in a language that you don\u2019t know is impossible\n* I\u2019m too old to wait 3-4 solid years to reach a basic german level and then go with another 5 years of education, I\u2019ll be 30+ and depressed\n* I\u2019m not enough German to start an *Ausbildung* (as they call it, basically an Internship but more comprehensive, you go to school and do some exams, it\u2019s some sort of further education that you do after High School but not really college education and more practical)\n* I can\u2019t move back to my home town to get a proper University education due to lack of money.\n\nI talked to some people into Facebook Groups and they told me that speaking German was not a problem at all for them since in their company everybody spoke English, but I think that does only apply if you\u2019re an experienced worker which is relocating and not to a not-yet junior developer like me who doesn\u2019t really have anything to prove his experience. \n\nSo my idea is basically to bypass all of this and do my experience alone, studying stuff alone really good and create a solid portfolio of webapps / various projects that\u2019d prove my skills, and after that applying directly as a real developer (in Germany, but all around the world too since I have no interest in living here for a long time) hoping that knowing German wouldn\u2019t be as essential and I don\u2019t have to go through the stress of studying stuff in German. \n\nIn that case, what would be the smartest thing to do? Will a 6 months english coding bootcamp be enough for me to be desirable to the German job market? Or independent self-learning? Or will some certificates (like w3schools ones or similar) do it? Or just a good portfolio?
